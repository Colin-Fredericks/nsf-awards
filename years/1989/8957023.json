 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the initial phase of this five-year Presidential Young                   Investigator Award's duration, research activities of                           Dr. Steven H. Strauss (Oregon State University) will focus on the               molecular phylogeny of forest trees, whereas efforts during the                 latter part of the funding period will concentrate on genetic                   engineering aspects (gene transfer systems, tree-pathogen                       interactions, and control of gene expression).                                                                                                                  With regard to molecular phylogeny, studies in Strauss'                         laboratory have dealt with chloroplast genome mapping and                       restriction site analysis of conifers.  The PCR (polymerase chain               reaction) method, coupled with automated gene sequencing of                     amplified DNA, is expected to provide major new insights into the               phylogeny of plants and factors controlling molecular evolution's               tempo and mode.                                                                                                                                                 The progression to a genetic engineering focus is dependent upon                development of gene transfer systems that will enable                           incorporation of \"foreign\" genes into plants.  Current work is                  aimed at insertion of toxin genes from the insect pathogen,                     Bacillus thuringensis, into the genomes of coniferous trees.                    The potential economic advantages of developing such a deterrent                to damage from forest insect pests are enormous.                                                                                                                Attempts will be made to characterize the molecular physiology of               a major root pathogen of Douglas fir trees.  The expectation is                 that it will then be possible to isolate and modify the genes                   responsible for pathogenicity, thereby gaining insights into                    host-pathogen interactions and making feasible disease-resistant                genetic lines of trees.                                                                                                                                         Finally, the most scientifically ambitious goals of this research               are directed toward manipulation of the systems controlling gene                expression.  This will first involve characterization of the                    major control sequences governing tissue-specific and                           environmental-responsive gene expression in conifers.                           Thereafter, it ought to be possible to splice desired sequences                 onto various target conifer genes.",
