 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study of geometric-asymptotic properties of nonlinear              dynamic systems with parametric and dynamic uncertainties is aimed at           the development of a design methodology for robust adaptive feedback            linearization.  An analysis of the effects of uncertainties (Section            3) will reveal whether nonadaptive state-feedback (Section 4) or                observer-based (Section 5) designs will guarantee robustness, and when          an adaptive feedback linearization approach (Section 6) is more                 appropriate.  New problem formulations in each of these areas motivate          the development of a unified geometric-asymptotic-adaptive                      methodology.  It is shown that the phenomenon of controller and/or              observer peaking, which has been noticed but not thoroughly studied in          the linear system theory, is of fundamental importance for robust               nonlinear feedback design.  Among the dangers of nonadaptive high-gain          loops is a possible interference of peaking with uncertain                      nonlinearities that can result in a drastic decrease of the stability           region.  A fuller understanding of geometric-asymptotic properties              will show when this type of interference can be avoided.                                                                                                        Adaptive parameter updates reduce the effects of parametric                     uncertainties and avoid the need for high-gain loops.  At present they          are restricted to systems with known nonlinearities, when a                     \"certainty-equivalence\" form of feedback linearization is applicable.           A crucial trade-off between adaptive and nonadaptive designs is to be           made vis-a-vis unmodeled dynamics, which are known to cause                     instabilities in some linear adaptive systems.  Robustness of                   nonlinear adaptive designs will be improved by algorithm modifications          based on current research in linear adaptive control.",
