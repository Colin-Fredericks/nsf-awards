 "awd_abstract_narration": "Form perception is an important capability that is involved in                  everyday tasks such as reading, driving and recognizing familiar                faces.  The application of linear systems models of form                        perception that are based on measurements of the infant contrast                sensitivity function have led researchers to a deeper                           understanding of the development of infants' ability to detect                  information in their environment and the development of basic                   visual processes.                                                                                                                                               Despite this success, recent data suggest that linear systems                   models may need to be modified to be applicable to high contrast,               suprathreshold stimuli.  This modification is important because                 most objects in the real world are high in contrast, and hence                  easily detected by infants.  The main goal of Dr. Stephens'                     project is to identify the modifications needed by linear systems               models to extend them to more real world situations.                                                                                                            This project addresses three important and closely related lines                of research.  The first involves the development and function of                contrast constancy in infants.  The second line of research is                  concerned with the development of form discrimination.  The third               area of investigation is designed to test the application of                    contrast sensitivity based models to the development of infant                  face preferences.",
