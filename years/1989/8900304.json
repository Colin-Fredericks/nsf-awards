 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Purusottom Jena of Virginia Commonwealth          University for continued collaborative research in materials science            with two Finnish physicists, Professor Matti Manninen of the University         of Jyvaskyla and Risto Nieminen of Helsinki University of Technology.           Their previous collaboration on the response of electrons to a                  variety of defect complexes has produced twelve joint publications so           far.  Their primary interest now is the electronic structure and                dynamics of atomic clusters.  Their collaborative work plan involves            a division of labor that efficiently exploits the complementary                 expertise and facilities of the three laboratories.  The U.S. group             will determine the atomic and electronic structure and properties of            aluminum, copper and iron clusters based upon self consistent LCAO-MO           theory and the density functional method.  The Helsinki group will              study the dynamics of these clusters at elevated temperatures in a              classical molecular dynamics simulation, using realistic inter-atomic           potentials.  Finally, the Jyvaskyla group will work on developing a new         approximation method that will enable them to treat larger clusters             consisting of more than 100 atoms.  Some of these computations will             require use of a supercomputer.  Through reciprocal working visits,             each of the PI's will participate to some extent in the work being              done at the other labs.                                                                                                                                         Atomic clusters are aggregations of atoms isolated in gas phase or in           non-interacting matrices.  They represent a new class of matter,                intermediate between atoms and solids.  They have unusual properties            that depend strongly on their size.  While a great deal of experimental         data is available on the properties of clusters, a comprehensive                theoretical understanding of the static and dynamic properties of               clusters is lacking.  The proposed research is an attempt to bridge             that gap.  The results may also have technological implications for             catalyis and new laser sources.  Clusters may also have potential               uses in photo-chemical, magnetic and optical recording industries.",
