 "awd_abstract_narration": "The detailed examination of the electrical characteristics exhibited            by semiconductor (or solid-state) devices, and the extraction of basic          \"inside-the-device\" information from those characteristics, are                 referred to as semiconductor measurements.  Equipment in the                    undergraduate laboratory where semiconductor measurements are                   performed is enhanced and the associated experiments revised.                   Specifically, modern test equipment is to be acquired to perform                current-voltage, capacitance-voltage, transient response, low-                  temperature, and a limited number of advanced characterization                  measurements.  The instrumentation is to be grouped so as to form               permanent stations of a functional nature.  In this way the laboratory          will simultaneously provide ready equipment access for interrogating            devices (fabricated by students in a separate teaching laboratory) and          for performing undergraduate student projects.",
