 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the enhancement of the Pattern Recognition and          Image Processing (PRIP) Laboratory of the Department of Computer                Science at Michigan State University.  A modern, distributed, pattern           recognition facility will be established, consisting of four image              processing/graphics workstations, a dedicated file server and a                 computation server, image acquisition and image output devices, a laser         range finder for capturing 3-D range data, an optical disk for                  archiving images, a LISP machine with a signal processing board, and            several workstations for software development.                                                                                                                  The PRIP Laboratory will provide the environment for the following              research projects:                                                                1. extraction and evaluation of features for recognition of 3-D               objects and construction of object models,                                        2. examination of the role of Markov Random Field models in pattern              recognition and computer vision,                                               3. investigation of the perceptual grouping problem in computer               vision,                                                                           4. development of parallel programming environments for computer              vision applications,                                                              5. application of pattern recognition and image processing algorithms          in remote sensing for land use planning, measurement of root                   systems by soil scientists, detection of structures in magnetic                 resonance brain scans, and the analysis of sequences of fluid                   images.                                                                                                                                                         The grant will also support development of the Artificial                       Intelligence/Knowledge Based Systems research group, which will                 interact with the PRIP Laboratory in studying the object recognition            problem.",
