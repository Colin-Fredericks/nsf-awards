 "awd_abstract_narration": "By optimizing electron delocalization and intramolecular                   charge transfer, polymers yielding third order nonlinear optical                susceptibilities in excess of 10-9 esu have been prepared as                    thin (1 micron) films.  Figures of merit as high as 104 have been               obtained for pristine materials.  Doping (intermolecular charge                 transfer) yields even larger values in some cases.  Ladder and                  penylpolyene materials prepared in preliminary studies also                     exhibit doping-induced visual transparency, i.e., bleaching of                  the pi-pi* interband transition and accompanying appearance of                  intraband (polaron/bipolaron) transitions.  Electron-donating and               withdrawing substituents are observed to stabilize these mid-gap                state species.  The reactivity of delocalized pi electron systems               with molecular oxygen has been investigated and the effect of                   interruption of electron delocalization upon nonlinear optical                  activity has been demonstrated.  This research focues upon                      further development of polymers, copolyers, and composite                       materials for enhanced nonlinear optical activity.  Particular                  attention is paid to the development of air-stable materials and                to correlation of data obtained for model compounds (oligomers)                 and polymers.  Copolymers and composites of linear and nonlinear                optical materials will be developed.  Components will be so                     chosen that indices of refraction are matched at low light                      intensities but are mismatched at high intensities.",
