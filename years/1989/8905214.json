 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this U.S.-Poland cooperative research project             between Anta Montet-White of the University of Kansas and Janusz                Kozlowski of the Jaqielonnian University in Krakow is to complete a             series of studies of the acquisition, distribution, and use of raw              materials during the Middle phases of the Upper Paleolithic age.  The           geographic focus of the project is a limestone plateau in the                   foothills of the Carpathian mountains in southern Poland, one of the            richest sources of good quality Paleolithic raw materials in Central            Europe. Polish scholars have led the way in this field and have been            among the first to demonstrate long-distance transport of raw                   materials in the Paleolithic.  The project offers American                      researchers and students unique opportunities for field access to               important archeological sites and testing models of early human                 settlement organization and economy.  The ultimate goal of the                  project is to arrive at a better understanding of settlement patterns           and territoriality that developed in north-central Europe in response           to changing climatic conditions before and during the time marked by            the last major advance of the glaciers.                                                                                                                         This project fullfills the program objective of advancing scientific            knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United States and Poland           to combine complelmentary talents, pool resources, and share research           facilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
