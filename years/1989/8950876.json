 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is allowing freshman chemistry students to use                IBM and Macintosh computers as an integral part of the laboratory               program.  The use of computers in the laboratory program                        includes:  direct data acquisition, analysis of data, graphical                 presentation, report generation, simulation of chemical model,                  and interactive video models for laboratory work.  Six IBM PS/2                 Model 50Z's are interfaced to laboratory equipment such as                      temperature and pH probes and spectrophotometers.  The data                     collected by the instruments are stored in files for further                    analysis.  Six Macintosh SE's are used for data analysis, report                generation, and simulation, including interactive video                         development which takes advantage of the unique graphics                        environment of the machine.  The use of both IBM's and MAC's                    insure that students are literate in the two major operating                    systems available for scientific laboratory work.  The                          institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of                   funds.",
