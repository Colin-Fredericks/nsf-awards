 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research effort is directed toward the development                    of theoretical foundations and software tools to serve as the                   basis for supporting engineering design and manufacturing                       automation.  These objectives require a synergistic                             interaction between theory and practice.  A substantial amount                  of effort over the past few years has been dedicated toward                     the development of theoretical models by adopting previous                      work in information theory, computability theory, symbolic                      logic, and design methodology.  This has been complemented by                   adopting existing techniques in artificial intelligence and                     extending them to new applications.  A common theme in this                     research activity is found in the transformational model of                     productive effort, from an initial functional specification to                  the final product.  This perspective has served as a unifying                   theme in fundamental investigations for both the design and                     manufacturing components.                                                            The research plan over the next five years is to work                      with industrial collaborators to further refine the                             preliminary models and theories developed thus far, and to                      generate software tools robust enough to accommodate the                        practical rigors of real-world applications.  The challenges                    of the envisioned work imply a high-risk, high-pay-off program                  for which a Presidential Young Investigator award would                         represent a major resource for turning the vision into                          reality.",
