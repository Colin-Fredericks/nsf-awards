 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to determine the current                    status, nature, and rationale of R&D investments in Japan by U.S.               corporations.  The study will 1) establish an inventory of U.S.                 corporations known to have made or to be making such R&D                        investments in Japan, 2) develop a questionnaire designed to                    elicit information relevant to the research objective, and                      3) administer the survey to the companies identified in step 1.                 Since relatively little is known about U.S. corporate R&D                       activity in Japan, the survey will attempt to establish a                       baseline of information regarding U.S. R&D operations in Japan.                      The growing investment in Japanese R&D facilities by U.S.                  firms is of relevance to policymakers in terms of addressing such               issues as technology transfer, the globalization of industrial                  R&D, and U.S.-Japanese technological competitiveness.  This study               represents a significant first step in understanding U.S. R&D                   investments in Japan by establishing a quantitative benchmark                   for such interests as the number of firms investing in R&D in                   Japan, the volume of their current and capital R&D investments,                 the nature of R&D (basic, applied development, product, process)                the characteristics of the scientists and engineers employed, and               other detailed statistical information.  Additional survey items                regarding the business objectives, strategies, and experiences of               companies with R&D labs in Japan should provide important                       qualitative information on the rationale for corporate R&D                      investments in Japan.",
