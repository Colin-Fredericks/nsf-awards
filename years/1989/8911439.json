 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports two-week institutes in parallel computing,                  one in 1989 and one in 1990.  The objective is to give                          approximately 25 graduate and post-doctoral researchers each year               a fundamental understanding of parallel computing.  There will be               a series of lectures on topics including parallel architectures                 for scientific computation, software tools to aid in implementing               parallel algorithms, use of graphics representations in the                     construction of parallel programs, and vectorization.                           Participants will then experiment with test problems and with a                 specific application that they have brought with them to the                    institute.  Ample time will be provided on the diverse                          multiprocessors in Argonne`s Advanced Computing Research                        Facility.  Some class time will also be spent  discussing the                   communications facilities available for local and remote access                 to these machines.                                                                                                                                              The institutes will provide an excellent opportunity for                        university researchers to acquire knowledge and experience in the               area of parallel computing.  After the institutes are over,                     researchers will continue to use the machines in the Advanced                   Computing Research Facility to conduct experiments in parallel                  computing.  Thus the institutes will have the long-term benefit                 of increased understanding of the applications for which specific               computer architectures are best suited.                                                                                                                         Two institutes of this kind have already been held, one in                      September 1987, the other in September 1988.  These institutes                  were viewed as an outstanding success by both staff and                         participants.",
