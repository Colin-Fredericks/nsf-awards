The objective of                    this research is to demonstrate that stability and passive                      operator theory (passivity in this sense refers to the                          preserving of a property--for example, in all such processes                    mass is conserved) can be used for motivate and develop                         nonlinear adaptive controllers for difficult process control                    problems like polymer and heterogeneous azeotropic                              distillation systems.  The PI plans to investigate and develop                  an alternative approach to nonlinear process control, an                        approach that is motivated by physical considerations and                       exploits a passivity property of thermodynamically closed                       systems.  This property is generic since chemical proceses are                  modelled by energy and material conservation relationships.                     Examples of passsive systems include exothermic reactors, heat                  exchangers, distillation columns and plug flow reactors.                                                                                                        A continuous stirred task reactor (CSTR), a plymer reactor and                  a heterogeneous azeotropic distillation process will be used                    to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.  Two                  topics will be addressed.  The first is how to use stability                    theory to select a feasible combination of measured and                         manipulated variables.  This problem is referred to as the                      nonlinear structure problem.  The second problem to be                          addressed is the design of adaptive controllers for nonlinear                   processes that have uncertain and/or completely unknown                         parameters.  This is the transient robustness problem.  The                     result will be used to define feedfoward signals.  Due to its                   simplicity and generality this research may also have a                         significant impact on the teaching of process control.",
