 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the mechanisms of replication and                    pathogenesis of plant viruses, particularly the tobacco mosaic                  virus (TMV).  Studies involve the significance of ubiquitination                of the TMV coat protein to the viral infection process.  This                   includes looking at the appearance of ubiquinated coat protein in               the free pool of cytosolic coat proteins, localizing the site of                the ubiquinated protein both on the TMV viruon and within                       infected cells, looking at the ubiquination of coat protein in                  transgenic plants and characterizing the response of plant cells                to viral infection by monitoring the cell's production of                       ubiquitin.  A second area of experimentation involves the                       mechanism whereby viral nucleic acids and proteins become                       established in the chloroplast during the process of viral                      infection.  Specific experiments are designed 1) to ascertain                   whether mature viral coat protein enters the chloroplast from the               cytosol or is synthesized within the chloroplast from viral RNA                 and 2) to investigate the mechanism by which viral RNA is                       incorporated into the chloroplast.                                                                                                                              The long-term goal of this work is an increased understanding of                the mechanisms by which plant viruses bring about pathogenic                    responses in infected plant cells.  Emphasis will be placed on                  the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).  The first goal involves                        investigating the significance of the finding that TMV (and                     numerous other viruses) contain the protein ubiquitin attached to               intact virus particles.  Ubiquitin is a small protein found in                  the cells of all higher plants and animals.  It is known to form                covalent attachments to selected proteins in numerous cells and                 plays a role in cell regulation, protein degradation and stress                 responses.  A second goal of this research addresses the                        observation that TMV RNA is able to enter the chloroplast during                infection which is coupled with the fact that the chloroplast is                the major site of cellular disruption during TMV infection.                     Studies will focus on how the viral RNA gets into the                           chloroplast.  This problem will be approached initially by                      developing a cell-free system for looking at the uptake of viral                RNA by isolated chloroplasts.  Once this system is operating,                   more specific aspects of the RNA uptake can be addressed                        experimentally.",
