 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continuing support for a Research Experiences               for Undergraduates Site at the New York Botanical Garden.  The                  Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) program will immerse                       students in a highly interactive, research oriented environment.                The major philosophical tenet is that success in science depends                on understanding the context of research as well as the substance               and procedures of a particular discipline.  Program goals are:                  (1) To provide intensive training in ecological research (2) To                 broaden students' perspectives on the contexts of scientific                    research (3) To give students direct exposure to the life of a                  research scientist (4) To promote a greater understanding of the                science of ecology.  Eight students will be brought to the                      Institute of Ecosystem Studies, building upon the strengths of                  the very successful 1988 program.  Under guidance of one or                     several scientific mentors, each student will delineate a                       research question and associated hypotheses, select appropriate                 methods, and develop a research plan.  Students will then                       implement and complete the project on their own, finishing with                 analysis and report writing.  Students will give a final                        presentation in a formal Research Symposium at the conclusion of                the program.  The final papers will be collated and published as                an IES Occasional Publication.  Special seminars at the Institute               will supplement the program.  The \"Research in Context\" seminar                 explores the relation between science and broader issues, while                 the \"Research Strategies\" sessions give specific training on a                  timely basis during the course of their research efforts.",
