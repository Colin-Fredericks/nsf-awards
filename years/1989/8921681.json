Past meetings of these officers have been                      very successful in providing them with briefings on major                       policy developments and initiatives.  The Chairman and                          Ranking Minority Member of the House Science, Space and                         Technology Committee, in a letter to Secretary Shultz before                    his resignation, emphasized the importance the Committee                        places on annual S&T Officer meetings.  NSF maintains close                     liaison with these officers in order to facilitate gathering                    information on developments abroad that are likely to have                      significant impacts on U.S. science and engineering.  Joint                     support of the meeting with the State Department will provide                   an opportunity for useful working-level conversations with                      these officers on NSF's special information requirements.",
