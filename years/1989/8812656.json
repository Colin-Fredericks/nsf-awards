The facility will add               a new capability for research in marine science to resident and                 visiting investigators at both institutions.  There is a long                   history of marine research in Woods Hole, with important                        contributions from the two institutions in marine biology,                      biomedical science and oceanography.  Particular strengths at                   the Marine Biological Laboratory are in the areas of physiology                 and biochemistry, and at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution               in whole animal biology and ecology.  The joint facility for                    molecular biology and biotechnology will bring a new dimension to               these institutions, allowing studies involving protein                          sequencing, peptide synthesis, DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis.                The immediate needs for such a facility involve research                        objectives in molecular phylogeny and evolution, in gene                        regulation and environmental adaptation in marine organisms, in                 developmental and neurobiology of marine species, and in ecology.               Combining the present strengths of year-round and visiting                      scientific staff with molecular biology instrumentation will                    create an unusual strength in marine biology at Woods Hole and                  will serve the marine science community for years to come.",
