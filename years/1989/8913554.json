 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is not a research project but one which attempts to arrive                 at a consensus among experts regarding the requirements of the                  scientific community for, and implementation of a National Neural               Circuitry Database (NCDB).  The major objectives of this project                are to:  (1) Formulate a position on the requirements for and                   appropriateness of establishing a NCDB; (2) Define the scope and                elements of data that would constitute the NCDB; (3) Define the                 precise format for representation of data.  This goal may allow                 for the linkage of spatial and anatomical data with text and                    tabular alphanumeric data in a way that makes it possible to move               easily between graphical and alphanumeric data and information;                 (4) Describe a prototypic or optional computer system that either               currently exists, or is under development, which can be used for                data storage and which will allow for optimal data communications               and sharing among various investigators; (5) Describe 1.2                       currently existing national database systems that illustrate                    various configurations for data storage, representation,                        retrieval and sharing.  Within this description include any                     documented experiences that these systems can provide for the                   successful establishment of the database and potential pitfalls,                if available; (6) Outline how the NCDB can be best organized in                 structure so that it can be efficiently established and maximally               organized for use by the neuroscience research community clinical               investigators, and educators.  This should include an ideal                     ordering of tasks and goals with both fiscal and temporal                       estimates of need; and (7) Based on what is learned from                        fulfilling these objectives, make recommendations on the future                 directions and policy in program development for the NIMH, NIDA                 and NSF with respect to establishment of a NCDB.",
