 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Search for and Study of Impact Structures in                  China\" between Drs. V.L.  Sharpton and Kevin Burke of the Lunar                 and Planetary Institute of the Universities Research Association                Inc. and Professor XU Dao.Yi and HE Yong.Nian of the Institute                  of Geology, State Seismological Bureau, People's Republic of                    China is sponsored by NSF.                                                                                                                                      Approximately 120 impact structures recognized worldwide                        document the nature and effects of asteroidal and cometary                      collisions with Earth.  While such structures are obscured                      readily by subsequent geological processes, the clustered                       spatial distribution within North American, Europe, and Australia               clearly illustrates the usefulness of intensive efforts to                      search for these structures and the potential for initiating                    such efforts within the remaining continental regions.  For vast                landmass of China, crater production calculations suggest 10.15                 craters with diameters (D) greater than 20 km should be present                 but none have been substantiated.  The American researchers have                documented 41 circular structures (3 km < D > 70 km) using                      orbital imagery of China, all but a few, however, appear to be                  endogenic.  The most promising structures include Duolun,                       Shanghewan, Londoushe, Neidong and Tai Hu Lake.  To date, clear                 petrographic evidence of an impact origin for any of these                      features has not been demonstrated.                                                                                                                             This study of impact craters in China will be achieved by (1)                   extensive field study of the 5 aforementioned structures in                     China, and (2) field study of 8 recognized impact structures in                 North America, to provide the Chinese with an understanding of                  impact structures.  This effort, involving structural mapping                   and sample collection for petrographic analysis and isotopic                    dating, will provide, in the short term, a clearer understanding                of the origin of the targeted Chinese structures, and in the                    short term, the basis for continuing effort to search for impact                structures in China.",
