 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will analyze the impact of government-initiated                      social change on individuals and families in the People's                       Republic of China.  It draws on data from a survey conducted                    in Shanghai in the spring of 1988.  At that time a random                       sample of 1200 residents, ages 25-65, were interviewed.  The                    study has three principal goals.  The first is to examine the                   effects of specific social changes, such as school closings                     and urban to rural migration, and to determine how these                        affected five different birth cohorts of men and women born                     between 1924 and 1963.  The second goal is to examine family                    processes and structures and to determine how social changes                    have affected family life.  The third goal is to examine the                    effects of social change on the degree of interdependency                       among individuals, both within the family and across                            generations.  This study is important because it will                           document how dramatic social changes in this historical                         period have had profound consequences for individuals and                       families.  Nowhere have these changes been more striking than                   in the People's Republic of China.",
