 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theme for National History Day 1990 is \"Science and                         Technology in History\".  It represents an excellent opportunity                 for teachers of history of secondary schools to encourage their                 students to explore interrelationship between science, technology               and society -- past and present.  This project will both identify               and develop classroom materials to implement the theme.                                                                                                         Five modules will be developed.  Three of these will focus on                   Physics in History, Chemistry in History, and Biology in History.               The modules will include general definitions and key terms, a                   discussion of the development of the specific science,                          description of major figures and their contributions, a time-line               noting some main events in the history of that science, an                      extensive bibliography (including information on audiovisual                    materials), and a section containing suggested instructional                    strategies and a list of topics for further investigation.                                                                                                      The final two modules will focus on the impacts of science and                  technology on society, and will include an historical overview of               specific impacts as well as a discussion of modern concerns.  A                 bibliography, and a list of instructional strategies will be                    included as well.",
