In this system,                                   the grass seed is germinated in organic waste                                   spread over polyethylene film.  when ready                                      for harvesting, the sod may be rolled like                                      carpeting leaving the polyethylene sheet in                                     place for the next crop.                                                                                                                                        The proposal leading to this Phase I award                                      was submitted in response to NSF Program                                        Solicitation 87-8, Small Business Innovation                                    Research.  During this phase, it was                                            determined that it was possible to substitute                                   waste materials for topsoil and to produce                                      consistently high quality sods in as little                                     as 5 weeks compared to 1-2 years for                                            conventional soil grown sods.  Additional                                       findings also revealed that the new sod                                         required less water, much less mowing, was                                      lighter and required no pesticides.  The                                        research indicated that the innovative system                                   provides a useful product from waste                                            materials; several crops can be produced per                                    year; extensive amounts of topsoil can be                                       saved and replaced by waste materials from                                      which nutrient resources are recovered that                                     would otherwise be lost; and the waste                                          materials are recycled into a non-food crop                                     thus maximizing the potential for adoption of                                   this concept.                                                                                                                                                   The concept being evaluated, if found to be                                     economically feasible, would utilize the                                        resource potential of otherwise wasted                                          materials, conserve topsoil, water and                                          fertilizer, and improve the efficiency with                                     which sod is produced.",
