 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a rapidly increasing interest in the use of soft x-rays in             many research and engineering fields.  The physically large drivers             currently used to demonstrate amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) in           the soft x-ray region make their use as laboratory x-ray lasers                 impractical.  A capillary discharge or sliding spark device provides            an alternate way to achieve the plasma conditions necessary for soft            x-ray ASE in elemental gases such a argon and krypton.  Capillary               discharges result in reproducible, stable, dimensionally correct                plasmas,  and their high efficiency makes the production of a compact           x-ray laser feasible.  In this phase of the research it is proposed to          computationally model and to design a capillary discharge device                capable of producing the necessary plasma conditions to demonstrate             ASE in argon at a wavelength of about 700 Angstroms.  Future phases of          the research will involve the development and diagnosis of the                  experimental apparatus necessary to demonstrate ASE in argon.  The              scaling and modification of the apparatus to demonstrate ASE at                 shorted wavelengths using higher-z materials will also be                       investigated.  Future work would also involve the development of                robust multilayer cavity mirrors for shorter wavelenghts to increase            the overall intensity of soft x-ray lasers.",
