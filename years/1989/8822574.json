 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides modest support to Dr. David B. Knaff of Texas               Tech University to facilitate a long term research visit to the                 University of Zurich, Switzerland.  There he will collaborate in                two lines of research with Professor Hans R. Bosshard of the                    Biochemistry Institute and Professor Reinhard Bachofen of the Plant             Biology Institute.  Both collaborative projects represent logical               extensions of Dr. Knaff's current research; however, his laboratory             is not adequately equipped to carry out certain aspects of the work             alone.                                                                                                                                                          Collaboration with Professor Bosshard centers on elucidating the                details of an electrostatically stabilized complex between two                  plant electron transfer proteins, ferredoxin and ferredoxin:NADP+               oxidoreductase (FNR).  FNR is a key enzyme of the photosynthetic                electron transfer chain of all oxygen-evolving photosynthetic                   organisms.  Chemical modification of specific amino acid groups                 will be employed to identify the charged groups that are involved               in holding the two proteins together.  Antibodies prepared against              different sites on FNR will be used to identify the specific roles              of different domains on FNR in catalyzing electron transfer from                ferredoxin to NADP+.  Characterization of the detailed geometry of              the ferrodoxin:FNR complex may provide clues to the likely                      configuration of other ferrodoxin:enzyme complexes.  It may also                provide insights into the functioning of related protein complexes              in mammalian metabolism.  Professor Bosshard has state-of-the-art               facilities for protein sequencing and he is an acknowledged                     world-leader in using the technique of differential chemical                    modification to identify specific amino acid residues involved in               the formation of protein complexes.                                                                                                                             Collaboration with Professor Bachofen will focus on identifying                 changes in electron-carrying protein constituents in one region of              the electron transfer chain of Rhodopseudomonas viridis that occur              when the bacterium is grown under aerobic versus photosynthetic                 conditions.  The electron transfer chains of such photosynthetic                purple non-sulfur bacteria have become increasingly better                      understood in recent years.  However, much less is known about the              respiratory chain than about its photosynthetic electron transfer               chain.  Resemblances between electron flow in photosynthetic purple             bacteria and in mitochondria, chloroplasts and cyanobacteria                    increase the potential relevance and significance of this work.                 Professor Bachofen's group offers valuable state-of-the-art                     computer-controlled apparatus for growing photosynthetic bacteria               and expertise in the molecular biology of such bacteria.",
