 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study the point spectra of                 elliptic self-adjoint (pseudodifferential) operators in a variety               of contexts.  This study is fundamental to the understanding of                 the relationship between analysis and geometry, and is of                       interest in mathematical physics.  The project will emphasize the               point of view of microlocal analysis.  A microlocal version of                  the Selberg trace formula for elliptic operators will be pursued.               Results from this project will then be applied to inverse                       spectral problems.                                                                   The work to be completed in this project will extend our                   knowledge of the relationship between differential operators and                geometry.  In this century mathematical physics has seen the                    great rise of operator theory as a tool for understanding the                   quantum mechanics of subatomic particles.  The principal                        investigator will develop microlocal analytic techniques to solve               various fundamental problems concerning these important                         operators.",
