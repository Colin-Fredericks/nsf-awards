 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mr. Curtis Marean, will continue his doctoral dissertation                      research under the direction of J.D. Clark.  He will complete the               analysis of faunal materials recovered from two groups of sites                 located near Lukenya Hill and the Central Rift Valley in Kenya.                 These sites which date from Late Pleistocene and Holocene times                 contain abundant faunal remains in addition to other materials                  such as stone tools.  Mr. Marean's focus is on the former and he                will examine these to determine species present, the ages at                    which animals - both wild and domestic - were killed, and                       butchering patterns.  This will allow him both to reconstruct                   changes in environment over time and to determine the responses                 of prehistoric peoples to them.                                                                                                                                 The CRV and Lukenya Hill sites document two major external                      impacts on indigenous East Africans over the last ca. 20 thousand               years.  The first is a major climatic change which occurred at                  the end of the Pleistocene and the second, the introduction of                  domestic animals and likely new cultures several thousand years                 ago.  Examination of each will provide evidence on how hunters                  and gatherers responded to major cultural and environmental                     pertubations.                                                                                                                                                   The research is important for several reasons.  While much                      archaeological research has been conducted in East Africa on both               earlier and more recent cultures, from this crucial time period                 little is known.  Secondly this work will increase our                          understanding of how simple societies adapt.  Finally, Mr. Marean               will train a Kenyan assistant and thus both assist in the                       development of science in Kenya and strengthen U.S. - Kenya                     research ties.",
