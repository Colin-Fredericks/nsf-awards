 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Juraska will continue her work on sex differences in the rat                cerebral cortex.  These structures are important for                            understanding the basis of cognitive learning abilities.  She                   will combine neuroanatomical analyses with perinatal hormonal                   manipulations to investigate how widespread sex differences are                 in mammalian brain, how hormones influence the development of sex               differences, and the implications of sex differences for normal                 brain function.  There are dramatic sex differences in                          developmental pathologies such as the learning disorder dyslexia,               and it has been suggested that testosterone in early development                may play a role in this syndrome.  Dr. Juraska will also examine                the possibility of sex differences in the connectivity of the                   cortex by mapping the distribution of neurons that project                      through the corpus callosum, the major track that connects the                  right and left hemispheres.  Her results will have important                    implications for understanding the importance of lateralization                 and its relationship to possible sex differences in verbal and                  spatial learning abilities in humans.",
