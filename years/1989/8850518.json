This three-year program will begin in September, 1988 and                       conclude in May, 1991.  During the academic year of year one,                   participants will; 1.) attend thirteen 3 hour lectures and                      seminars by visiting marine scientists 2.) identify, define                     and design research problems and hypotheses to be                               investigated and chosen in consultation with the NURP                           Director and Chief Scientist. 3.) Conduct a literature                          search; 4.) meet with scientists at NURP, and 5.) become                        acquainted with the nature and philosophy of science.  During                   the summer of 1989 the participants will be involved in a six                   week summer institute on Long Island Sound.  Seventeen days                     will involve on-the-water investigations including two days                     utilizing a NURP submersible.  The remaining thirteen days                      will be devoted to laboratory experiments, sample analysis                      and computer entry of data.                                                                                                                                     During year two participants will complete their                                investigations, reduce and analyze data, write a paper or                       prepare a poster session and plan for the transfer of their                     research experience into the classroom.                                                                                                                         During year three participants will implement a student                         research program in their own schools.  In-school visits will                   be conducted by the staff to observe the student research                       program.  The participants will report on and discuss their                     projects.                                                                                                                                                       Program participants will receive six graduate credits from                     Eastern Connecticut State University.                                                                                                                           This program allows the Teacher Enhancement Program the                         opportunity to observe an approach which will increase the                      participants' understanding of the nature of scientific                         inquiry and the ability of teachers to convey this                              understanding to students.                                                                                                                                      Project Oceanology ant the National Undersea Research Program                   will contribute an amount equal to 66% of the National                          Science Foundation award.",
