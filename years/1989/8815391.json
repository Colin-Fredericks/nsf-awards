In addition, Brian Maple of the                           University of California at San Diego will make                                 available his extensive laboratory facilities for a                             three-way collaboration. They will make high quality                            thin film, single crystal and sintered specimens of                             known high temperature superconductors, search for new                          superconducting compounds and study the properties of                           the superconducting state.                                                                                                                                      Torikachvili has worked with some very good Brazilian                           and U.S. scientists in superconductivity.  This work                            will continue the collaboration with the Unicamp group                          and should be the beginning of a fruitful cooperation                           in a vital and timely area in which Brazil has made                             important advances.  The facilities in Brazil are                               adequate for this work and the addition of Maple's                              laboratory makes the sum total of facilities                                    outstanding.",
