Students will be                   drawn primarily from the 11 engineering colleges which, together                with Rose-Hulman, comprise the Engineering Alliance for Global                  Education (EAGLE) whose overall objectives are to provide                       international work experiences for recent engineering graduates                 or senior-level students, and to develop curricular tools to                    enable participants to profit from such experiences.  Up to 75                  students will participate in the first cycle of the Rose-Hulman                 program.  The first part will consist of a one-week screening                   and orientation session at the end the summer prior to the final                year of engineering studies.  The second part will be a                         customized, mentored self-study course in the Japanese language                 on the participants' home campuses during their final year of                   engineering studies.  The third part will take place during the                 summer following receipt of the engineering degree and will                     consist of a ten-week, resident, intensive language and cultural                skills session.  Industrial support is being sought to place                    those who complete the program successfully in year-long                        internship positions with U.S.-owned or affiliated companies in                 Japan immediately following that final summer.",
