 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference on Neural Plasticity has been held               every alternate year since 1977 in July at Brewster Academy,                    Wolfeboro, New Hampshire.  Gordon Research Conferences were                     established to stimulate ideas in an informal setting.                          Uninhibited discussion is fostered by GRC strictures on the                     publications, proceedings, or indeed the citation of                            presentations.  The format has proved particularly useful in the                conference on Neural Plasticity--a highly interdisciplinary                     meeting in which the subject of modifiability of the nervous                    system is examined at the molecular, cellular and systems levels                and in which the participants come from broadly different                       backgrounds (biochemical, pharmacological, anatomical,                          electrophysiological, behavioral).  One evening is set aside for                a keynote speaker and poster session.  The  remaining eight                     sessions will focus on specific issues, with 3 or 4 scheduled                   speakers so that significant time is preserved for discussion.                  The discussion tends to continue informally during the afternoon,               when no formal sessions are scheduled.  It is the experience of                 participants that these informal interactions are often more                    fruitful than the extended sessions characteristic of other                     meetings.  The formal program includes sessions on:  cellular and               molecular models of learning, learning in the adult cerebral                    cortex, genetic and hormonal models of neural development and                   plasticity, regulation of neuronal receptors, oncogenies and                    neural plasticity, neural grafting, NMDA receptors and long term                potentiation, and the role of ion channels in neural plasticity.",
