 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal are to conduct theoretical work                  on the experimental design problem in coupled groundwater                       supply and water quality systems, and to evaluate the developed                 design methodology by conducting modified pump tests in the                     Borden aquifer, for which the hydraulic and mass transport                      parameters have already been determined by other field studies.                 The experimental design problem includes the determination of                   the optimal experimental conditions for estimation of the                       hydraulic and mass transport parameters in groundwater                          systems.  The experimental conditions define the location,                      timing and magnitude of groundwater pumping or recharge, the                    location of observation wells in the aquifer system, and the                    sampling frequency and duration of the experiment.  The                         experimental conditions, which are based on cost, reliability,                  and identifiability criteria, are designed, from a management                   and prediction perspective, to provide optimal information for                  parameter estimation, and as a result, minimize the ill-                        posedness of the identification process.  The laboratory and                    field tasks are expected to refine understanding of the sorptive                characteristics of the Borden aquifer for several organic solutes               (for which extensive transport data are already available), and                 then implement a modified pump test in the Borden aquifer in                    which inorganic tracers and the organic solutes are injected.                   The modified pump test will be designed for optimal estimation                  of the hydraulic and mass transport parameters.  The design                     will then be evaluated by comparing the estimated parameters                    to those determined by other field and laboratory studies.                                                                                                      Results of this research are expected to be useful in                           determining identifiability criteria for hydraulic and mass                     transport parameters, the trade-offs associated with monitoring                 network costs and reliability, and provide baseline information                 for the design and operation of groundwater monitoring                          networks.",
