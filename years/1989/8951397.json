 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports development of an advanced computer                    science laboratory which supports undergraduate research                        activities in the areas of programming languages, compilers, and                software design.  The laboratory supports a required senior                     research project, which is a full year of independent research                  conducted by the students in close consultation with the computer               science faculty.  It also services two junior level software-                   oriented computer science classes.  A major goal of this project                is to significantly increase the participation of undergraduates                in interesting and important computer science research with the                 idea of making graduate study in computer science more                          attractive.  The institution is providing matching funds in an                  amount equal to or greater than the funds provided by the                       Foundation.",
