 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new excimer-laser based diagnostic method is being developed  that            should yield instantaneous two-dimensional temperature and density              fields in high-temperature media such as occur in open flames or in             internal combustion engines.  Because the method has excellent time             resolution (  10ns), it is ideal for analysis of turbulent burning.             It uses laser induced fluorescence, but with a novel approach that              eliminates the problem of collisional- quenching that normally limits           LIF to pressures less than   0.01 atmosphere.  A powerful narrow-band           UV laser excites molecules to predissociating states that are so                short-lived that there is no time for quenching collisions.  It is              proposed to acquire a UV image intensifier and a self scanned array             camera to obtain two-dimensional images of the fluorescence.  One can           then literally take \"snapshots\" of the density distribution of a                single selected quantum state.  By comparing the densities of two such          states using two camera systems, the temperature distribution can be            calculated with a single laser shot.                                                                                                                            Laser techniques are particularly promising for combined                        detector/computer technologies for optimization of combustion system,           minimizing pollutant emissions or maximizing fuel economy for example.          The method proposed here will lead us in that direction by extending            LIF to a more useful pressure regime.",
