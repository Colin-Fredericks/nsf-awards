 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports collaborative research between Nicholas                     Cernansky, Drexel University, and Shi Shaoxi, Tianjin University                on the effects of fuel properties and physical factors on engine                combustion processes.  This award adds an international                         dimension to work funded under NSF grant CBT 8706030.                                                                                                           Through a coordinated research program, with the chemistry of                   combustion being investigated at Drexel and the physical                        processes of combustion being studied at Tianjin, the                           investigators hope to obtain a better understanding of the                      chemistry and physics in engine combustion and autoignition                     processes.  Drexel will focus on low and intermediate                           temperature oxidation of hydrocarbons using a variety of                        laboratory systems, including static and flow reactor systems,                  to isolate relevant chemical processes.  Tianjin will focus on                  physical factors, such as surface deposits, heat transfer and                   fluid flow effects, using a variety of laboratory and engine                    test facilities.  Ultimately, this research could lead to                       improved engine performance.",
