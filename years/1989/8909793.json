 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four stages of research in the development of III.V semiconducting              thin film materials bonded to polycrystalline or amorphous                      substrates are presented.  First, new chemical vapor deposition                 (CVD) source materials for the deposition of III.V semiconducting               thin films, such as gallium arsenide, indium phosphide and aluminum             gallium arsenide, will be developed.  These new source materials                will be designed to display enhanced properties for CVD with the                aid of theoretical calculations.  Each new source materials will                be synthesized, isolated, purified and characterized using standard             chemical techniques.  Second, the new source materials prepared in              the first stage will be evaluated for use in CVD processes.                     Photolytic, pyrolytic and electron.assisted deposition techniques               will be initially investigated for the formation of desired thin                film materials from each new source compound.  The decomposition                (fragmentation) thermodynamics for each compound will also be                   studied using electron impact mass spectroscopy (through the use                of appearance potential calculations). Third, studies will be                   initiated in which monocrystalline GaAs,InP and AlxGa1.xAs will be              deposited on amorphous or polycrystalline ceramic substrates using              a combination of graphoepitaxial and CVD techniques. Finally,                   attempts will be made to deposit patterned thin films of an                     appropriate material on the ceramic.supported III.V semiconductor               to demonstrate potential application of these new materials to                  device technology and engineering.  This research has important                 implications for the improved fabrication and operation of both                 microelectronic and optoelectronic devices.",
