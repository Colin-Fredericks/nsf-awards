 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments directed at understanding various aspects of the                    electronic structure of solids using two primary techniques are                 described in this proposal:  soft x-ray emission spectroscopy and               inelastic electron scattering spectroscopy.  They have designed                 and built a soft x-ray emission spectrograph with a number of                   unique features.  The sample chamber is a UHV system with an                    argon ion gun for cleaning and an Auger spectrometer to check                   sample surfaces.  The toroidal holographic diffraction gratings                 focus the emission spectrum onto a high quantum efficiency-                     position-sensitive detector.  They have recently added a sample                 entry airlock so samples can be changed without letting air in                  the chamber.  The pressure in the sample chamber is in the 10 to                the minus ten range.                                                            The inelastic electron scattering spectrometer was built several                years ago, and has been used for a wide variety of projects.                    They are able to measure the momentum transfer dependence of                    spectral features revealing dynamical effects.  In addition a                   wide energy range can be covered allowing a Kramers-Kronig                      analysis to be carried out.",
