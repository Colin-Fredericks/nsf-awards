 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this program is to teach students the                             fundamentals of knowledge based systems and artificial                          intelligence (AI) and then allow the students to develop an                     expert system to demonstrate their skills.  The students will                   participate in an eight-week workshop at LSU.  During the                       first four weeks they will learn the fundamentals of AI.                        They will also participate in a seminar that will introduce                     careers in agricultural and life sciences, ethics in science                    and engineering, and research methodology.  During the second                   half of the workshop, the students will work with a faculty                     mentor to develop an expert system in one of the agricultural                   or life sciences.  The students will have the opportunity to                    work in the LSU Knowledge Based System Development Laboratory                   utilizing state-of-the-art AI workstations.                                                                                                                     The participants will choose from a wide array of projects in                   the agricultural sciences.  The expert system may be a                          diagnostic tool, an identification guide, a trouble shooting                    program or an interpreter to a simulation model.                                                                                                                This approach to a young scholars program not only allows the                   participants to work with scientists in a field of study, but                   they will also be able to study decision making processes and                   learn the concepts of uncertainty in decision making and                        logical steps in the process.",
