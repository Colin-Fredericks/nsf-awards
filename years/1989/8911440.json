 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide funds for international travel for                      approximately 20 U.S. participants to attend the NATO Advanced                  Study Institute on \"Managing Science in a Steady State.\"  The                   support will benefit U.S. scholars in the field of science,                     technology and society studies and U.S. science policy analysts                 and managers, by exposing them to (1) a curriculum designed to                  introduce and augment the knowledge of each group with that of                  the other, and (2) their counterparts, and the work of their                    counterparts, in other countries.  The Institute will be held the               first two weeks of October 1989, at Il Ciocco, Tuscany.  It                     includes three components, lectures, panel discussions, and                     seminars around three themes:  national science systems - how                   they are changing; the selection and management of the research                 base; and knowledge, skill and career progression in science.                   The faculty includes men and women who are highly regarded                      scholars and administrators from the U.S. and Europe.  Both the                 quality of the faculty and the selection of the program for                     inclusion as a NATO Advanced Institute provide assurance as to                  its quality.  Guidelines for choosing U.S. recipients for travel                grants include:  need; balance between academic participants and                those in management or policy positions; balance between                        experienced and junior researchers, research managers and policy                analysts; representation of a wide range of academic disciplines,               home organizations, and government, industry and academic                       participants.  Results will include a book and evaluative reports               on the need for further training and research in this field.  In                the last two decades, the fields of science studies and science                 policy have grown and become international.  This grant will                    provide opportunities for the kind of exchanges that are                        essential if U.S. researchers and practitioners are to remain at                their forefront.  An award is highly recommended.",
