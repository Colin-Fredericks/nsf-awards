 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid data gathering and analysis capabilities of modern,                   computerized X-ray powder diffractrometry (XRD) places this technique           on an equal footing with the more established techniques of IR and NMR          for routine characterization in the undergraduate laboratory.  Data             that once took hours to record and process can now be obtained in               minutes.  At Rider, XRD is introduced into the curriculum at an early           stage of a student's development and provides a more diverse experience         at the upper levels.  XRD is used as a routine tool for phase                   identification in the organic laboratory, thereby exposing not only             chemists but biochemists and biologists to; its utility.  XRD is also           used in upper level chemistry and geoscience courses for such tasks as          quantitative analysis, crystallite size determination, elementary               crystallographic characterization and conformation of simple                    structure.                                                                                                                                                      The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of               funds.",
