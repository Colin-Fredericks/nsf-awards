 "awd_abstract_narration": "For a decade field investigators have used the concentration of                 chlorophyll-derived pigments in the digestive system of copepods                as a way of estimating natural feeding rates because the                        measurement can be done immediately on field caught animals,                    thereby allowing estimates of natural variance in the feeding                   process and bypassing incubation procedures which result in                     uncertainty and artifacts.  Recently, the method has been                       criticized because pigment budgets on some occasions do not                     arrive at a full accounting for chlorophyll.  However, the method               has been so insightful in oceanic ecology that it continues to be               used in spite of the contention that budgets indicate                           assimilation of pigment or other unknown source of loss is of                   major importance.  This investigation will try to establish                     sources of error and suggest new methodology for field                          measurements of chlorophyll-derived pigments in animal guts.                    %%%                                                                                                                                                             Feeding by grazers in the sea is a fundamental process which                    underlies not only population dynamics and individual growth, but               also transformation of particulate material and release of                      dissolved components utilized by microbial food webs.  Much                     debate over the years has turned on our inability to know how                   fast animals feed in nature in the sea and how much variation is                involved in the process.  Most experimental approaches involve                  confining animals in containers of various sizes with known or                  natural food supplies.  The errors introduced by catching and                   confining the animals are almost always invoked as reasons why                  the results are not very clear cut.  A method that does not                     subject the animals to containers was considered a important step               ahead almost a decade ago.  Not surprisingly, the method has been               shown to be very useful in describing feeding patterns and rates                of natural populations of grazers in the sea.  It has also been                 shown to have some deficiencies which this investigation will                   explore in an attempt to refine our understanding of the method                 and suggest changes that will make results more quantitative.",
