 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel preparation method has been adapted to a catalyst for                   oxidation of halogens in dilute air streams.  This procedure produces           a highly active oxidation/reduction catalyst from stainless steel               screen, which is resistant to the attack by the reactor product, HCl,           and exhibits good stability and selectivity.  Mechanistic insights              into the preparation variables, primary reaction kinetics, and                  potential deactivation limitations will be developed.  New                      relationships should be elucidated between catalyst activity and                surface morphology changes evident in electron microprobe and                   microscope patterns.                                                                                                                                            Chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) represent a serious health risk if              present in groundwater or the air.  Incineration can be used to                 convert them to HCl, which can then be neutralized in a scrubbing               operation.  Two difficulties are associated with this technology:  the          requirement of adding significant amounts of auxiliary fuel if the              waste stream has a sufficiently low heating value, and the possibility          of creating unsavory products of incomplete combustion.  Catalytic              oxidation provides an alternative route from CHC to HCl plus CO2, and           is ideal for dilute hydrocarbon mixtures provided the catalyst                  activation temperature is maintained and poisoning can be avoided.              Research                                                                        will concentrate on these last two requirements.  The temperature               of the catalyst will be maintained by ohmic heating, and                        poisoning will be avoided by a judicious selection of the active                catalytic agent.",
