 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rosensteil School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at                     the University of Miami will acquire several items of                           oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of                         shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use                     on or in association with the two research vessels the                          institution operates.  A substantial part of the ships'                         operating schedule during 1989 is in support of NSF-sponsored                   research projects.  The instrumentation will also increase                      the capabilities of the ships and of the University to                          support research and engineering activities.  The                               instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                                       -Disk drive system and other peripheral computer equipment                       for increasing shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities,                   -600-kHz transducers for the Acoustic Doppler Current                            Profiler system for making precision measurements of                             subsurface circulation features,                                              -Scintillation counter for measurements of radio-isotope                          tracers and other chemical parameters,                                        -CTD for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater                                  conductivity and temperature as a function of depth,                          -Fluorometer and transmissometer for measuring chlorophyll                       and other optical properties in the water column,                              -High speed modem for transferring large data sets between                       shore based laboratories and the ship,                                         -Portable laboratory upgrades for improving dissolved oxygen                     and salinity measurements,                                                     -Satellite image display system for near real-time analysis                      and tracking of remotely sensed data at sea.                                                                                                                   The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the Institution to support NSF-sponsored                          research and engineering projects.",
