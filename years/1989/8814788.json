 "awd_abstract_narration": "A switching system is a multimodal system with switching rules of a             specific form.  While the individual modes are given by (ordinary or            partial) differential equations, the evolutionary behavior of a                 switching system involves some qualitatively new considerations.  Such          systems arise both as 'reduced order models' in the modeling of                 thermostats and other threshold-controlled systems involving nonlinear          'fast dynamics' (singular perturbation) and also in the implementation          of feedback switching controls for multimodal systems.                                                                                                          Investigation of switching systems and switching system models is               proposed in three areas:                                                                                                                                                obehavior of (classes of) switching systems as 'dynamical               systems', i.e., stability, existence and characterization of                    periodic solutions, etc.;                                                                                                                                               ogenericity and stability of behavior with respect to                   perturbation of parameters, especially near certain                             degeneracies;                                                                                                                                                           orelation to the world: 'engineering' applications and a                deeper understanding of the relation of these switching                         system models to alternative (e.g., more detailed) models.                                                                                                      The proposed research is foundational for the understanding of a wide           class of applications involving interactions of continuous with                 discrete-event systems.",
