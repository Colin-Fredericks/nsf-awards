 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an accomplishment-based renewal of an extremely                         productive research program on the microeconomic sources of                     macroeconomic volatility.  Under the previous grant the                         investigator demonstrated that fluctuations in productivity are                 induced by changes in product demand and factor supplies, rather                than technology shocks.  This result challenges a key assumption                of real business cycle theory, an important school of thought in                macroeconomics.  This result has stimulated empirical and                       theoretical work by the investigator and others on demand driven                business cycles.  Renewed support permits the investigator to                   pursue this research agenda.                                                                                                                                    The investigator also developed an innovative and powerful test                 of the assumption of a competitive industry.  If an industry is                 competitive, then the Solow productivity residual (the difference               between the rate of growth of output and the weighted growths of                inputs) should be invariant to exogenous shifts in product demand               and factor productivity.  Under the previous grant the                          investigator was able to reject the invariance proposition for a                large number of U.S. industries.  This project explores what                    kind of equilibrium prevails in these industries.  Preliminary                  research suggests that inputs and outputs behave as if the                      technology had increasing returns of scale.  Future research                    examines evidence of externalities in industrial organization or,               more specifically, whether one firm's efficiency rises when the                 firms it deals with have higher levels of activity.  The                        investigator develops a new methodology for testing for the                     presence of increasing returns and thick-market externalities.                  Specifically, econometric methods are developed for testing for                 spontaneous noise in major aggregate economic variables.  The                   presence of spontaneous movements in output is evidence of                      economies with increasing returns and thick-market externalities.                                                                                               This research makes significant contributions to our                            understanding of macroeconomic fluctuations and industrial                      organization.  The research on economies with increasing returns                is especially important because most empirical and theoretical                  work in industrial organization assumes competition with                        constant-returns-to-scale.  Evidence of significant externalities               within U.S. industries would also suggest that R&D expenditures                 are more important than previously believed.",
