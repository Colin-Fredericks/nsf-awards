 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Miller is supported by the Experimental Physical                      Chemistry Program in experimental investigations on both the                    dynamics and spectroscopy of a variety of neutral binary,                       tertiary, and higher order molecular complexes.  Information is                 obtained on the structures of these complexes and on the flow                   of energy between various internal and translational                            (dissociative) degrees of freedom for vibrationally-excited                     complexes.                                                                                                                                                      Opto-thermal detection techniques are used to measure                           photofragment angular distributions and obtain state-to-state                   photodissociation cross sections following vibrational                          excitation of one molecule in a complex.  Results are yielding                  insight into rotational state correlations between two                          departing photofragment molecules and also give accurate values                 for the complex dissociation energies.  Extensions are planned                  that will allow probing of higher vibrational states of both                    these complexes and stable molecules through a two laser IR-IR                  double resonance experiment.  For the complexes, the double                     resonance technique will also allow measurements of                             predissociation lifetimes in real time.",
