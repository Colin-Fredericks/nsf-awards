The equipment                  will greatly improve the advanced laboratory in biochemistry,                   usually taken in the junior year.  It will also allow                           establishment of an introductory honors laboratory stressing                    biochemical methods to be taken the previous year; with proper                  scheduling, much of the equipment can be used in both courses.                  The upgraded biochemistry laboratory experience will improve                    training, expose students to experimental science in a positive                 setting  at a time in which they are making key career decisions,               and better prepare them for other laboratory courses (advanced                  molecular biology laboratory, undergraduate research) which                     usually depends on the biochemistry laboratory for preliminary                  training.  The grantee institution is matching this NSF award                   with funds from non-Federal sources.",
