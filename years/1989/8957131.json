 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI is particularly interested in the development of practical               diagnostic techniques for structures because this work draws upon               her expertise in nondestructive testing, stress wave propagation,               fracture mechanics, dynamic finite element analysis and                         structural engineering.  To date, the impact-echo method to                     locate flaws in platelike, reinforced concrete structures, such                 as pavements, walls, and slabs, have been used. The PI will                     determine the feasibility of using the impact-echo idea for                     evaluating the quality of and detecting cracking in reinforced                  concrete structures, such as locks and dams, large foundations                  and bridge piers, and offshore structures.  Initial research will               involve using an existing three-dimensional, transient finite                   element code to develop an understanding of how stress waves                    propagate in these types of structures and how the response of                  the structures changes when defects are present.  Currently, no                 solutions exist for any of these problems.  Once this under-                    standing has been developed, experimental studies of small models               of larger structures with and without flaws will be carried out.                Finally, the results of the field studies will be checked by                    coring or other techniques to verify the results.",
