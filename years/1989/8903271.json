 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal has two main components.  The first attempts to               describe nucleon structure, and the interactions between nucleons               in terms of Quantum Chromodynamics, (QCD).  There are two regions               with a straightforward connection:  short distances, where                      asymptotic freedom allows a perturbative treatment in terms of                  quarks and gluons, and large distances, where nucleons appear as                manifestations of the non-linear nature of QCD at large                         distances:  the latter leads to a picture of nucleons as                        solitons, and can be handled in the large N (number of colors)                  and classical limit, while interactions between them can be                     described in terms of multimeson exchange.  (\"QCD at small q is a               complicated nonlinear theory of mesons\" Witten).  The aim is to                 understand  the connection between these two pictures.  As a                    start 1/N and quantum corrections to the soliton picture are to                 be tackled.  The second component is to continue the study of                   scattering theory with techniques that combine algebraic and                    analytic techniques:  this has applications to molecular as well                as nuclear physics.",
