 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifty physics teachers in the Southern California area will                     participate in a two-year Institute (1989-91) aimed at                          improving their content background in modern physics and                        their teaching skills in general.  School districts with high                   minority representation will be the primary target population                   in recruiting participants.  The main thrust of the Institute                   will be in modern physics which is generally the area in                        which teacher backgrounds are weakest.  The first summer will                   focus on electricity and magnetism (E&M) and optics with                        applications to modern physics.  The second summer will focus                   on relativity, quantum theory, atomic and nuclear physics and                   special topics.  Ten of the participants will be experienced                    mentor teachers who will act as coaches by providing support                    and guidance for teams of four less experienced \"crossover\"                     teachers.                                                                                                                                                       Activities during each of the four-week summer institutes                       held at Cal State Fullerton will include content updating,                      laboratory experience, lesson preparation, discussion of                        pedagogical techniques and problem-solving practice.  Content                   enhancement will be facilitated by use of \"The Mechanical                       Universe\".  Lectures by project directors, coaches and                          visiting speakers will present participants with alternative                    teaching styles and different techniques for teaching                           physics.  Laboratory experiences will aim at maximizing                         hands-on opportunity by having participants perform the                         experiments.  A group of on-site high school physics students                   will provide practice sessions for the participants during                      the duration of the summer institute.                                                                                                                           During the academic year, follow-up activities will include                     use of interactive television for monthly video-conference                      meetings, three Topical Conferences (scheduled on weekend) on                   current issues in modern physics and site visits by coaches                     and project directors.  Finally, as part of the follow-up                       agenda, each participant will receive visitations from                          coaches and project directors for observation in their own                      classrooms.                                                                                                                                                     Several dissemination strategies are planned.  These include:                   opening the topical conferences to twice as many                                participants, requiring them to make presentations to their                     colleagues about the program, establishing a communications                     network of Southern California physics teachers under the                       auspices of the Orange and Los Angeles County Boards of                         Education, and having a system-wide conference of the 19                        campuses of the California State University to discuss the                      project.  Project evaluation will be performed by Far West                      Laboratory for Educational Research and Development on a                        continuous basis during the project.  Cost-sharing is                           approximately 34% of the National Science Foundation request.",
