 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this project is to determine the                          influence of nucleotide binding and protein phosphorylation                     on the regulation of pathogenesis and define specific                           mechanisms mediating RNA replication.  A host encoded,                          autophosphorylating, dsRNA dependent protein kinase (p68) has                   been identified whose activity is regulated in host plants by                   virus or viroid infection.  The protein has biochemical and                     immunological similarities to proteins implicated in the                        replication of poliovirus and in the regulation of protein                      synthesis.  Specific aims of this proposal are directed at                      determining the role of p68 in infected and healthy tissues                     and at studying the mechanisms by which its activity is                         regulated.  In order to define the function and regulation of                   this protein, it is being purified and biochemically                            characterized to determine the gene sequence.  Antiserum to                     the protein is being raised and will be used in localization                    studies, screening of cDNA libraries and to probe the                           activity of the protein.  Further studies on the purified                       protein will include characterization of the nucleotide                         binding and phosphorylation stoichometries, partial                             sequencing, phosphoamino acid analysis and tryptic peptide                      mapping in the presence and absence of dsRNA and use of                         various nucleic acid species to define the mechanism by which                   dsRNA regulates the activity of p68.  If time permits the                       gene and mRNA sequences will be obtained, yielding                              information on the total amino acid sequence of the protein                     and allowing further characterization of regulatory events at                   the genetic level.                                                                                                                                              Viruses and viroids effectively interact with and regulate                      host proteins during replication and pathogenesis.  The                         identification and characterization of host proteins directly                   involved in pathogenesis is important to determine                              fundamental mechanisms regulating host-pathogen interactions.                   These studies will provide a foundation to determine how                        pathogens regulate host proteins, what effect on disease                        development the interaction has, and provide insight into RNA                   regulatory mechanisms.***//",
