 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"3-2-1 Contact,\" the nationally broadcast award winning children's              public television science series, has been reaching children aged 8-12          with daily half hour science programming since 1980 with support from           both the National Science Foundation and the U. S. Department of                Education.  In seven seasons of production, CTW has produced 225 regular        and two special shows, generating an estimated 633 million viewings by          the target audience and more than 1.66 billion viewings by viewers of           all ages.  With completion of primary show production, the series will          begin repeat broadcasts in the fall of 1989 drawn from the library of           existing programs.  This final award will support continued broadcast of        the series and insure the widest possible distribution and utilization          of \"3-2-1 Contact.\"                                                                                                                                             CTW will implement a Transition Plan to sustain series broadcast,               establish series access as a VCR based science resource, and insure             permanent access for teachers, schools, and out of school resources to          the \"3-2-1 Contact\" program library.  Broadcast activities will include         supporting a portion of the costs of residuals for rebroadcast for a            five year period, production of five \"3-2-1 Contact EXTRAS\" -- single           topic half hour specials with high visibility -- and encouraging                increased off air taping of the series by teachers.  Support for school         use of the series will be strengthened with the development and                 distribution of topic indexing software and teacher guides, the creation        of short \"3-2-1 Contact\" segments specifically tailored to the classroom        needs of teachers and a series blockfeed to schools to create a                 permanent archive of shows.  Community outreach partnerships will be            strengthened and home video opportunities explored as well.                                                                                                     This five year award will allow millions of American children the               continued opportunity to view science programming after school on a             regular basis, and will assist their teachers in making effective use of        \"3-2-1 Contact\" program materials in classroom settings.",
