 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of the location of firms has been influenced recently by         new developments in two different fields.  In spatial economics,                Hotelling-type spatial competition models have been developed to                describe how firms determine the price and location of sites through            multistage games in which they do not cooperate with one another.  The          parallel development of discrete-choice models has shed new light on            the ways in which consumer and firm behavior are based on the concept           of random utility.  This research project will synthesize insights from         these two theoretical traditions and will develop a new discrete-choice         model of firm location.  The model will be developed by systematically          examining the impacts of a number of factors on probabilistic                   preference models of firm locational behavior.  Inclusion of these              factors will enable the model to more realistically reflect the actual          conditions under which firms operate.  The final stage of analysis will         consist of development of a simulation program that would enable users          to readily examine the impacts of different conditions on the                   locational behavior of firms.                                                        This research will bring together two significant lines of inquiry         in the theoretical examination of the geographic behavior of economic           units and will enhance our understanding of the processes and criteria          that lead firms to locate in some places and not in others.  This work          will also provide an improved basis by which the actual behavior of             firms may be empirically analyzed.",
