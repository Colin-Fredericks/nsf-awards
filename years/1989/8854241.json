 "awd_abstract_narration": "In view of the continued increase in the older population and the rapid         advances in knowledge related to aging, it is critical that psychology          faculty in 2-year and 4-year colleges keep themselves abreast of                current developments in the specialized area of aging and include them          in their curriculum.  A two-week institute in the psychology of aging           for 25 instructors from Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota is             being conducted.  The institute is focusing on current research and             theory on ten different topics related to aging.  The program is                strengthening the participants' disciplinary expertise, enhancing their         skills in presenting up-to-date material in aging to their students,            and is providing them with opportunities to interact intensively with           experts in the field and with colleagues from other institutions.  In           order to promote participants' utilization of what they learn in the            institute, the project director will maintain contact with them during          the following year and will conduct site visits to the colleges with            large minority and female enrollments.  In addition all members of the          institute faculty will be available throughout the year to provide              consultation to the participants.  Follow-up assessments will be                conducted to determine the institute's impact on undergraduate                  education.",
