 "awd_abstract_narration": "The continued drive toward VLSI and three-dimensional integration               places ever-increasing demands on metalization structures.  New                 materials are needed to advance these vital technologies.  The many             advantages of refractory metal thin films prepared by chemical vapor            deposition (CVD) including conformal step converage, high                       electromigration resistance and low resistivity make them attractive            for gate, interconnect, contact, diffusion barrier and via plug                 metalizations.  However, the application of CVD tungsten and                    molybdenum to VLSI processing has been impeded by the secondary                 reactions caused by the florine ligands of the elemental source                 reagents used in the CVD process.  These reactions ultimately lead to           the failure of the device.  The objectives of the proposed research             are the elaboration of a set of molecular design criteria for                   refractory metal source reagents and the identification of a novel              organotungsten CVD source reagent which revolutionizes VLSI                     metalization.  These goals will be met by applying a multidisciplinary          approach in which results from film growth and fundamental                      decomposition studies are used to refine the molecular structure of             the source reagents.  The immediate commercial impact of CVD                    refractory metals on VLSI processing would be the advance to a new              generation of metalization structures offering superior performance             and stability relative to existing components.",
