 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple tubulin genes and mechanisms of posttranslational modification         are thought to establish the properties and functions of microtubules in        different cell types, but the details are still not known for a single          cell or microtubule system.  Avian erythrocytes contain a unique                cytoskeletal structure, the marginal band, which is composed of one of          these isotypes.  The goal is to characterize tubulin expression and the         structure of the erythrocyte tubulin gene in chicken erythrocytes and           determine if a constitutive tubulin found in undifferentiated                   erythroblasts can substitute for the specific isotype during the                formation of this unique cytoskeletal structure.  Specific aims are to          (1) characterize the pattern of expression of constitutive and specific         tubulins during erythrocyte differentiation; (2) analyze the gene of the        specific tubulin for enhancer elements that activate its expression; (3)        analyze function by transfecting cells with tubulin genes and examining         cytoskeleton formation by immuno-light and electron microscopy.  NIH-3T3        cells will be transfected with constructs containing the specific CB6           tubulin gene, and conversely early erythroblaslts will be transfected           with the constitutive CB3 tubulin gene to alter the ratio of endogenous         tubulin isotypes to determine if a constitutive isotype can substitute          in marginal band formation.  A positive effect in band disruption will          imply a unique function for the specific tubulin gene.                                                                                                          This project will address the fundamental question of what, if any, is          the functional distinction between highly-similar isotypes of cellular          proteins, encoded for by separate, developmentally-regulated genes.",
