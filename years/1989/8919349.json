This is an area that has assumed increasing importance                 with the advent of recombinant DNA and other advanced                           biotechnology techniques.  The purpose of the meeting is to allow               the leaders of the field, along with many new investigators who                 have just entered the area, the opportunity to exchange                         information in both a formal and informal way.  This interchange                has resulted in many important collaborative projects and the                   symposium now represents the premier meeting on this subject.                   The results of the meeting will be published in a symposium issue               of The Journal of Chromatography.",
