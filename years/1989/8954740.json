 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the program is to establish a model science                         program for undergraduate elementary preservice teachers                        designed to meet the needs of minority students, especially                     the Hispanic and Black populations.  The project has four                       major components: one the recruitment and retention of                          minority students who are interested in becoming specialists                    in the teaching of science to young children; two the                           revision of thirteen science and education courses in the                       elementary school teacher preparation program and general                       science major; three the development of field placements in                     elementary school science classrooms that have substantial                      minority enrollments; and four the dissemination of                             information on such a model science program for future                          elementary school teachers.  In addition to serving the 270                     currently enrolled preservice teachers, this program will                       target fifteen newly admitted minority students per year, who                   will have been given full scholarships by the institution. In                   order to improve the retention rate of these students, the                      project will also develop a number of support programs such                     as the Summer Vestibule Program, special tutoring                               opportunities, mentorships, and multicultural sensitization                     seminars.",
