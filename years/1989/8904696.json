 "awd_abstract_narration": "The decay of 87 Rb to 87 Sr results in increasing 87 Sr/ 86                Sr in the rock matrix, which is recorded by garnet as it grows.                 We have shown that variations of 87 Sr/86 Sr within single                      crystals of garnet can be measured to high enough precision to                  determine rates of growth of the garnets.  The time resolution                  by this method was of about 2.5 million years due to the                        relatively low Rb/Sr of the schist matrix from which the garnets                grew.  With renewal we plan to extend the use of the method and                 continue to make improvements in sampling and measurement                       techniques.  We should be able to improve the time resolution by                at least a factor of 10 by focusing on rocks with higher Rb/Sr                  ratios and by improving our understanding of Sr isotope                         redistribution during metamorphism.  Our observations have                      resulted in the first measured rate of a prograde                               tectonometamorphic process.  We now want to extend application                  of our method to geological problems of regional extent in                      western New England and to test some samples from the eastern                   and central Alps toward a similar goal.",
