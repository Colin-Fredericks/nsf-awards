 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iron is an important element in the physiology of living                        organisms.  Nature has elaborated an elegant system for                         modulating and controlling the balance between iron insufficiency               and iron toxicity by developing the protein molecule ferritin.                  This protein is similar in form and function in species ranging                 from bacteria to mammals.  Its basic function seems to be that                  of storing iron during growth cycles when this element is                       abundant and distributing it controllably during metabolic                      demand.                                                                                                                                                         With both the structure of the protein shell and the various                    protein interactions known in detail and the structure and                      composition of the mineral core likewise quite well understood,                 the stage is now set for a detailed examination of the mechanism                for iron release and deposition in ferritin.                                                                                                                    The specific aims of the project are to prepare and characterize                specific redox states of ferritin which represent intermediates                 in the process of iron deposition or mobilization.                              Electrochemical, biochemical, magnetic and spectroscopic methods                will be used to carryout the planned experiments.                                                                                                               The Program recommends support for this collaborative project.",
