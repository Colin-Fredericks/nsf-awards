 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Amazon Deep-Sea Fan is a typical large modern deep-sea fan.                 Past studies have documented the structure and surface                          morphology of the fan, including the location and character of                  the most recently active channel which crosses the fan.  Cores                  collected in the vicinity of this channel sample the sediments                  deposited by channelized flows before activity ceased following                 post-glacial sea level rise.  We propose here (1) to use                        morphological and sedimentological data to determine the likely                 characteristics of channelized turbidity currents and (2) to                    develop a stratigraphy which will allow us to determine the age                 of sedimentary activity on the fan.  The stratigraphy will be                   based on delta 0-18 curves supplemented with AMS C-14 dates.                    New techniques developed at NCSU can measure 0-18 on samples                    containing few foraminifera, an advantage in cores with high                    sedimentation rates.  AMS C-14 dates on the biogenic carbonates                 and pollen analysis will help to constrain the stratigraphic                    dates.  Benchmark isotope stratigraphies, developed in the                      middle and lower fan areas where downslope flows are minimal,                   will applied to the most recently active channel/levee areas                    where downslope flows are more common. Such a stratigraphy                      will allow us to determine the ages associated with                             depositional events such as the cessation of flow down                          abandoned channels and the emplacement of major debris flows.                   We can then determime rates for fan processes and tie                           depositional patterns to sea level.  The high-resolution 0-18                   stratigraphy will also be valuable for assessing the late                       glacial/early interglacial role of the amazon River in                          determining paleoclimate and paleoceanograhic changes.",
