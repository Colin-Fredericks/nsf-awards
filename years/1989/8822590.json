 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Thomas J. Hilbish, University of South Carolina, and Dr.                        Brian Bayne, Institute for Marine Environmental Research,                       Plymouth, England.  The objective of the research is to                         investigate the genetic basis of physiological variation in                     two species of the mussel Mytilus in an area of apparent                        hybridization in southwest England.  The research represents                    a unique opportunity to analyze the behavior of potential                       gene complexes in traits known to be important to the                           survival of an organism in its natural environment.  In                         addition the work should shed light on the dynamics of gene                     flow in an area of species overlap.                                                                                                                             Genetic and physiological differentiation occurred between                      allopatric populations of Mytilus during the Pleistocene.                       One taxon occurs predominantely in cold-water, while the                        other is a warm-water form.  In southwest England the two                       taxa hybridize and certain populations provide an array of                      genotypic combinations that will allow the investigators to                     analyze the genetics of physiological differentiation of                        the two taxa.  The investigators will utilize physiological                     traits that may explain the differences in biogeography of                      the two taxa.  This project will benefit from Dr. Bayne's                       expertise in evolutionary physiology of the Dr. Hilbish's                       background in physiological-evolutionary genetics.",
