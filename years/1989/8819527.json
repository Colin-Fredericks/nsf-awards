 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this award is to improve understanding                    of Midwest mesoscale atmospheric processes. Program                             initiatives are organized to bring about improvements in                        classroom, research, interactive computer, and application                      areas.  All initiatives derive substance from UNIDATA, a                        national program designed to help universities use                              communication and computing technologies to analyze                             scientific data. Definition, assembly, testing, and                             evaluation of PC-McIDAS within a local area network provides                    the vehicle for achieving program goals.  Research aspects of                   the award will focus on a better understanding of local                         weather in the hilly Driftless area. In this area, severe                       storms, often with heavy precipitation totals, lead to high                     flash flood potential.  New GOES sounding capabilities                          coupled with Doppler radar (La Crosse is a Doppler site)                        promise to yield data for better identification, tracking,                      and characterization of severe weather events.  Weather and                     climate students, approximately 750 per year, will gain                         interactive computer experience at ten workstations in case                     study and near real-time weather analysis. Creative analyses                    of the PC-McIDAS product stream presents faculty, staff, and                    advanced students with significant challenges.",
