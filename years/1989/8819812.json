 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bird song has intrigued people for a long time.  Besides                        occasionally being very musical, it is acoustically very complex                and shows much variation among species.  Males of some species                  sing only a single song their entire life, while males of other                 species possess extremely large repertoires of different songs.                 For example, male Northern Mockingbirds can sing over 250                       different songs during any particular day, and they continue to                 learn new songs throughout their life.  Further, they combine                   these songs in predictable ways, thus providing much information                about their current behavior, motivational state, and                           reproductive status.                                                                                                                                            Why particular species, such as the mockingbird, possess such                   complex singing behavior has long perplexed evolutionary                        biologists.  The possibility that females may be distinguishing                 among males on the basis of their singing behavior and                          selectivity mating with males which have a particular singing                   behavior has been suggested by several researchers.                             Unfortunately, this possibility remains controversial and, to                   date, inadequately tested.  Dr. Derrickson will conduct an                      integrated series of experiments to test if female mockingbirds                 can distinguish among different singing behaviors.  In each                     experiment, tapes of different singing behaviors will be                        presented to captive females.  How females respond behaviorally                 and physiologically to these different tapes will allow                         Dr. Derrickson to determine if they do indeed distinguish among                 singing patterns and if this capability might have caused such                  complex singing to have evolved.",
