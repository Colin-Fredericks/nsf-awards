Task one, building the conceptual model, will be based on                       recent work by the principal investigator and colleagues on                     temporal factors in group interaction and performance.  The                     fully articulated conceptual model is one end-product of the                    research.  Task two involves review and integration of                          research on technological enhancements in groups.  An up to                     date assessment of that body of research is the second end-                     product of the research.  Task three involves using the model                   and the integration to formulate a systematic research                          program for subsequent empirical research on the flow of work                   in technologically enhanced groups.  That detailed                              formulation of a program of research is the third end-product                   of the research.//",
