 "awd_abstract_narration": "New problems of basic interest in nuclear and particle                     physics at intermediate energies will be studied.  The initial                  emphasis in the program will be on a precise measurement, with                  ~0.5 percent accuracy, of the rate of decay of charged pions.                   This process provides the theoretically most unambiguous means                  to study weak u-d quark mixing which directly tests quark-                      lepton universality and can thus constrain certain aspects of                   physics beyond the present Standard Model.  The proposed                        experiment represents a first step in a staged effort at                        improving the present 4 percent accuracy of the pion beta decay                 rate, to approach and eventually surpass that of pure Fermi                     nuclear beta decays (now ~0.2 percent).  At the level of                        accuracy proposed for the first step, our measurement will                      provide the most sensitive test of the CVC hypothesis in a                      meson.  A large-solid-angle detector will detect decays at rest                 and will also be sensitive to other rare pion decays.  Initial                  runs have been approved for 1989 at PSI, and detector                           development work is presently under way at University of                        Virginia.  Other experimental commitments include a precise                     measurement of the muon momentum in pion decay at rest at PSI,                  a measurement of the spin-dependent structure functions of the                  neutron and proton in the scaling region at CERN, and work                      related to future experiments at CEBAF.",
