 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze the economic incentives               for research and development, the dissemination of technical                    information through the patenting process, and the effects of the               patent law and resulting licensing agreements on product market                 interaction among successful innovators.  The prospects of this                 type of competition affects the prospective profitability of R & D              and, hence, the propensity of firms to invest in R & D activities.              These aspects of the process of making and using technological                  advances are influenced by provisions of the patent law and by                  antitrust policy.  The incentives for patenting intermediate                    stages of technical improvement will be analyzed. Patents in this               context produce a social benefit of spreading technological                     information and bringing the product to market earlier, but at the              same time entail the disadvantage to the firm of increasing                     competition in subsequent stages of the product market which may,               thereby, lower profitability.  In addition, the effect of the                   breadth of patent protection on the pace ofsuccessive product-                  quality innovations will be studied, as well as the propensity of               firms to undertake totally new lines of research, rather than                   build directly upon previous knowledge.",
