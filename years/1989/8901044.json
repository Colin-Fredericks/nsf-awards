 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silene alba, a flowering plant found along roadsides, can                  become infected with a parasitic disease, caused by a fungus.                   In addition to rendering the plants sterile, this disease causes                both male and female plants  to produce flowers with anther sacs                filled with spores of the fungus.  The insects which pollinate                  healthy Silene alba also visit diseased flowers, thus acting as                 vectors of this disease.  This study attempts to show how the                   behavior of the insect pollinator/vector influences the                         plant-pathogen interaction between Silene alba and the fungus by                using an approach which combines field observations,                            experimentation, and mathematical modeling.                                          No studies of plant-vector-pathogen interactions have                      included the behavioral component of the vector in modeling the                 dynamics of the system.  This study in which the disease vector                 is also the pollinator of the plant is an ideal place to begin an               investigation of how vector behavior affects a plant-pathogen                   interaction.  The voluminous literature on the effect of                        pollinator behavior on plant population dynamics can be drawn                   upon to develop models in this plant-pollinator/vector-pathogen                 interaction.  The results of this study will be of interest to                  epidemioligists working in plant-vector-pathogen systems as well                as to evolutionary ecologists working on the effects of                         individual behavior on population and community dynamics.",
