Among the issues addressed are mechanisms of surface                            reactions, structures of reaction intermediates, catalytic                      properties of the surface, and sources and impact of carbon                     and other impurities incorporated into the growing films.                       Techniques employed will include thermal desorption                             spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, and high-resolution                   electron energy-loss spectroscopy.  Initial investigation                       focusses on the growth of zinc oxide, zinc sulfide, and                         cadmium sulfide on substrates of silicon or gallium arsenide,                   then progressing to homoepitaxial growth of these materials as                  well as growth of zinc telluride and cadmium telluride.                         Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and chemical                    beam epitaxy (CBE) are important processes for the growth of                    thin films of compound semiconductors.  In this study, basic                    processes relevant to the application of these methods to the                   production of films of II-VI semiconductors are studied.                        These particular semiconductor are important because they form                  the interface that interconverts optical and electronic                         signals.",
