 "awd_abstract_narration": "The essence of biological specificity resides in the energetics,                dynamics and structural aspects of protein-ligand complexes.                    Although a great deal of emphasis has been placed upon                          elucidation of the structural aspects of proteins, primarily                    through the use of X-ray diffraction studies, the understanding                 of ligand binding and enzyme catalysis cannot proceed in the                    absence of knowledge of the energetics and dynamics of the                      systems.  During the past decade diverse techniques such as NMR,                hydrogen exchange and fluorescence spectroscopy have demonstrated               that proteins are dynamic molecules.  Theoretical treatments such               as molecular dynamics calculations have also predicted motions of               protein residues.  A picture of the protein molecule has thus                   developed which is quite different from the rigid, static                       descriptions suggested by earlier X-ray diffraction studies.                    Considerable effort is now being focused on elucidating the                     functional significance of these motions to enzyme catalysis and                the energetics of ligand binding.                                                                                                                               Dr. Jameson will examine ligand binding and subunit-subunit                     interactions in malate dehydrogenase, cytoplasmic malate                        dehydrogenase and elongation factor using fluorescence                          spectroscopy, elevated hydrostatic pressure and enzyme kinetic                  measurements.  Fluorescence spectroscopy permits the                            determination of lifetimes as a function of environment and                     rotation dynamics of tryptophans in proteins.  High pressure                    techniques are currently being applied with increasing frequency                to the study of biological molecules because of the intrinsic                   advantages of the technique as compared to other techniques such                as temperature variation.",
