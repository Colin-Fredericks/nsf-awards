 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the biosynthesis of volatile                            halometabolites in the marine environment.  Current plans                       include continuing studies on the mechanism of action of                        bromoperoxidases isolated from marine algae.  In particular, a                  powerful bromoperoxidase which has been isolated and purified                   to homogeneity from Penicillus capitatus will be studied with                   respect to its mechanism of action and the chemical nature of                   its halogenating intermediate. the P. capitatus  enzyme                         catalyzes the peroxidation of bromide ion with concomitant                      formation of bromoform and other volatile halohydrocarbons from                   -keto acids.  Preliminary experiments have detected a new                     enzymatic route for the biosynthesis of methyl chloride via a                   methyl transfer reaction.  Cell free extracts of wood rot                       fungus, Phellinus pomaceus, catalyze the formation of menthyl                   chloride and methyl bromide from S-andeosyl-methionine and the                  appropriate halide anion.  Plans for the immediate future                       include the isolation, purification, and characterization of                    this methyl chloride synthetase enzyme(s).                                                                                                                      A major goal of this research is to discover the sources and                    mechanisms of production of methyl chloride in the marine                       environment.  The annual global emission rate of this compound                  is estimated to be 2 X 10 7 tons per year and the principal                     source of this compound in the upper atmosphere is biological                   activity on the oceans (> 90%).  Methyl chloride and other                      volatile hydrocarbons are produced as marine forms, accumulate                  in the ocean waters and then distill into the atmosphere.  In                   view of the concern over the hydrocarbons in the upper                          atmosphere, it appears important to learn something about the                   biosynthesis of a compound which is undoubtedly the most                        prevalent of all hydrocarbon species.  Also, if methyl chloride                 synthetase genes could be inserted into plants and soil                         microorganisms this could theoretically lead to halotolerant                    crop production and perhaps allow reclamation of salty soils.                   Dr. Hager is eminently qualified for this work.",
