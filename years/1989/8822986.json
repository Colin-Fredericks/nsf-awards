No research has been directed                                      toward this question.  The proposed research                                    has six objectives:  1) to assess plans made                                    by executives responsible for tourist-                                          oriented private firms to assist them in                                        making decisions related to evacuation of                                       their organization when threatened with                                         disaster; 2) to identify factors that account                                   for the variation in this planning; 3) to                                       describe the sequence of behavior that                                          culminates in actual evacuation decisions; 4)                                   to identify factors that account for the                                        variation in these decisions, e.g., social                                      characteristics, organizational structures                                      and community qualities; 5) to describe                                         established and emergent organizational                                         policies designed to guide employee behavior;                                   and 6) to formulate policy recommendations                                      for emergency managers and business                                             executives.  A two-phased comparative field                                     study methodology will be used.  Phase I                                        field studies will assess evacuation planning                                   in three different sized exemplary                                              communities and will identify factors that                                      account for variation.  Phase II field                                          studies will be completed following two major                                   disasters, actual or threatened, wherein                                        evacuations occurred.",
