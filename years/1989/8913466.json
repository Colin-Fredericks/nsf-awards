 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prehistory of Peru is characterized by an alternation between               large, regionally expansive empires and periods of smaller, local               polities.  In the last of these great empires, the Inca expanded                to cover both Peruvian highlands and lowlands and consolidated a                number of regional groups under a single unified rule.  Ms.                     Frances Hayashida, guided by Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, will study the                process by which this incorporation took place.  The results will               provide the basis for her doctoral dissertation.  Her research                  will focus on two rival polities, Jayanca and Tucume, both of                   which eventually came under Inca control.  In prior research, Ms.               Hayashida has located five Inca period sites distributed between                these two polities.  She will return to these, map standing ruins               to determine the degree of Inca architectural influence, collect                surface ceramics, and then conduct limited excavations.  With                   these data she will be able to determine differential response to               the Inca.                                                                                                                                                       This research is designed to increase understanding of how                      empires expand and control conquered regions.  Anthropologists                  have postulated that in an effort to consolidate their holdings,                empires promote particular polities as local administrators at                  the expense of rival polities.  These favored polities accept                   their relationship with the empire as a kind of alliance,                       receiving power and prestige in return for their cooperation.                   Ethnohistoric documents indicate that Jayanca and Tucume                        interacted with the Inca in distinct ways.  The Tucume resisted                 while the Jayanca formed an alliance with their conquerors.  What               this research will do is examine the developing relationships                   among the Jayanca, Tucume, and Inca and determine to what extent                this model holds.                                                                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons.  It will increase               our understanding of how complex societies emerge and are                       governed.  It will also assist in the training of an extremely                  promising young scientist.",
