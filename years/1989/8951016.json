 "awd_abstract_narration": "A principal aim of the upper-level geology curriculum at Hamilton               College is to give students direct experience in acquisition and                interpretation of geological data, including those obtained using               modern instrumentation.  Use of modern analytical equipment in the              curriculum will ensure not only that students gain experience in                acquiring, understanding, and interpreting quantitative data, but also          that they will bring a more sophisticated perspective to their upper            level courses, in which critical reading of primary literature is an            important concern.  The geology department will establish a modern X-           ray laboratory in order to achieve these goals.  This laboratory will           consist of an integrated X-ray diffractometer and X-ray fluorescence            spectrometer interfaced with a personal computer.  Such a facility will         give students the opportunity to perform sensitive mineralogical and            geochemical analyses of geologic materials.  This facility will be              intimately integrated into the curriculum through laboratory exercises          in Geochemistry, Igneous/Metamorphic Petrology, Sedimentary Geology,            and Mineralogy courses.  The college requires a senior project of all           students, and availability of X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence          instrumentation will significantly expand both the types of projects            that students will be able to undertake and the quality of the results.                                                                                         The college will match the award with an equal amount of funds.",
