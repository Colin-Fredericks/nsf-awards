 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to expand on recent innovations in growth                    theory and development economics in order to explain different                  patterns of growth in different countries and time periods.                     Recent work has addressed this topic but the most important                     models which have emerged,  such as those of Lucas,  Romer,  or                 Boyd-Prescott,  tend to predict similar behavior for economies                  with similar initial conditions.  They are unable to account for                the fact that a variety of countries that look relatively similar               at certain points in time (say Canada and Argentina around 1940)                look very different economically at later dates.                                                                                                                In their own previous work,  the principal investigators have                   given examples of how theories can be developed to explain why                  economies with similar \"initial conditions\"  follow very                        different time paths for per capita output.  In this proposal                   they seek to extend their earlier work in order to integrate a                  theory of endogenous population dynamics with a theory of per                   capita income determination. Existing growth models suggest that                population and (per capita) income dynamics should interact. This               proposal sets forth several models that carry on this fruitful                  line of research.                                                                                                                                               More specifically,  the investigators propose to elaborate a                    dynamical theory of endogenous population growth that is                        consistent with well-established historical development patterns                and helpful in identifying some of the less obvious reasons why                 some countries grow faster than others over long periods of time.               Among the regularities they seek to illuminate are (i) a logistic               pattern of population growth in many parts of Europe and Asia                   over the last four hundred years;  (ii)  the passage of many                    successfully developing countries from an early extensive period                of economic growth to a later intensive period;  (iii)  fertility               cycles with a period of approximately sixteen years;  and (iv)                  the slowest growth often occurs in the poorest countries.  The                  underlying theory differs from existing literature on endogenous                fertility in that children in traditional economies are modelled                primarily as factors of production rather than as consumption                   goods,  and the terms of trade are allowed to be set by intra-                  family bargaining instead of competitive markets.                                                                                                               The new models are well designed to answer a rich set of                        questions,  but are still tractable to analyze.  Not only are                   they challenging from the standpoint of growth theory and                       development economics,  but they are also highly policy-relevant.               Although other researchers have made little progress on the key                 issues to date,  the work of the investigators is far enough                    advanced to give promise of a variety of significant results.",
