 "awd_abstract_narration": "A multilevel relational database (MDB) stores data at different                 security levels and provides this data to users with different                  clearance levels.  The security problem for an MDB is to prevent                users from obtaining any unauthorized data.  Until recently,                    research about the security of an MDB was concerned with access                 control.  While access control techniques work to prevent one                   type of attack, the security can still be subverted by inference                attacks.  An inference attack to the MDB occurs if a user can                   infer unauthorized information in the MDB by using his                          preknowledge about the MDB and query responses authorized to him.               This work investigates the inference problems arising from                      integrity constraints in the database (i.e., constraints that                   enforce the correctness of data).  Two of the most popular                      integrity constraints, i.e. functional dependencies (FDs) and                   multivalued dependencies (MVDs), are considered.  Examination of                the combination effects of FDs and MVDs on the security of an                   MDB under an elementary item classification scheme will be made.                A protection scheme with minimum information loss will be found.                The work also will investigate the same problem under a dynamic                 environment, i.e. data in the MDB can be changed.  Finally, the                 research will explore the possibility of unifying inference                     mechanisms for different integrity constraints.",
