Dr. Bechtel is focusing on two stages in the                      history of investigations into the mitochondrion's role in                      cellular respiration.  During the first period, he is                           concentrating on the cell biology investigations carried out at                 the Rockefeller Institute where the techniques of cell                          fractionation and electron microscopy were developed and employed               to identify the mitochondrion as the locus of cell respiration                  and to discover its internal structure.  In the second period, he               will examine the endeavors of four different biochemists who then               made use of these techniques in their attempts to explain how                   mitochondria figure in cellular respiration and oxidative                       phosphorylation in particular.",
