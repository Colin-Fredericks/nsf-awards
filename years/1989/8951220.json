 "awd_abstract_narration": "A micro-computer based laboratory is established in the Psychology              Department of Bowdoin College to enhance undergraduate's understanding          of basic principles of scientific research and their specific                   applications in psychology.  Five micro-computers and the hardware and          software necessary to interface them with other laboratory equipment            (e.g., slide projectors, taperecorders) are being acquired.  The                computers are used to control stimulus presentation and to collect              responses in studies conducted by students at three levels of                   expertise:  (1) Students in the introductory course use the computers           to obtain \"hands on\" research experience by conducting simple                   experiments that are coordinated with material covered in lectures.             (2) Students in each of the Department's three experimental laboratory          courses (Cognition, Language, and Research in Social Behavior) use the          computers to conduct an original, full-scale experiment that the                students design and carry out as a group.  (3) Students doing senior            honors projects and other independent research projects use the                 laboratory equipment in their advanced, original research projects.             Use of the new equipment allows an increase in the amount, quality, and         variety of psychological research conducted by students at Bowdoin.             The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of               funds.",
