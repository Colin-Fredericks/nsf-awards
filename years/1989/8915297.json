 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental problem in the study of marine ecology is to                 identify natural populations and understand how they change                     through time. This problem is especially challenging in marine                  organisms that metamorphose during development or change habitats               throughout their life cycle. Adult stages of many species are                   benthic (e.g. barnacles), while their larval stages are                         planktonic and may disperse over long distances. Many aspects of                the ecology of adult populations of coastal invertebrates have                  been intensively studied, but the effects of larval dispersal on                genetic structure of populations are unclear and potentially                    extensive.                                                                           The goal of this fellowship research is to gain knowledge of               the degree to which dispersal and selection combine to affect                   variation between populations. Genetic differences may arise via                natural selection, genetic drift, non-random mating, and                        mutation. Differentiation is reduced by gene-flow between                       populations: dispersal of propagules such as eggs, sperm, larvae,               cysts, or adults. These two forces are usually in a state of flux               and the genetic patterns we see at one point in time depend on                  the relative strengths of these forces.                                              Dr. West will compare individual mitochondrial DNA sequences               of planktonic barnacle larvae and newly settled juveniles                       collected adjacent to adult sites. Differences between these                    groups and possibly changes within cohorts through time will                    yield a new perspective on formation and maintenance of the                     genetic structure of these populations.  Mitochondrial DNA                      analysis can reveal the degree to which larvae travel as clouds                 of closely related individuals. Continued sampling of these                     patterns through time gives clues to the amount of genetic                      fluctuation that a population may naturally experience. The                     studies are made possible by means of primer-directed enzymatic                 DNA amplification using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",
