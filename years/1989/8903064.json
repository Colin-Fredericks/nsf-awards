 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research                           project in robotics between Miomir Vukobratovic of the Pupin                    Institute in Belgrade, the University of Novi Sad robotics                      research group, and Masayoshi Tomizuka at the University of                     California at Berkeley, investigators will study                                decentralized, non-adaptive control of robotic                                  manipulators.  Software packages will be developed and                          implemented for performance evaluation of robots, adapative                     and non adaptive control, cooperating robots (two robots                        working together) and new robotic control mechanisms.  The                      problems addressed are current and of industrial                                importance.  This proposal provides for unique                                  experimentation with actual robots in addition to computer                      simulations.  The grant links a pioneering Yugoslav research                    group in robotics to U.S. experts in adaptive controls and                      dynamics.                                                                                                                                                       This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but                         include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
