The purpose of the joint agreement is to provide                    funds for the data analysis of college course taking in the                     National Longitudinal Study of the high school class of '72 along               with the follow-up of their activities over a sixteen-year                      period.  The work will be conducted by Clifford Adelman and his                 assistant in the higher education branch of the Office of                       Research in the Department of Education.  A report will be                      prepared on course-taking activities in the following areas --                  life sciences, chemistry, physics, and engineering.  The data and               analysis files resulting from this work will be placed in the                   public domain as soon as possible following a release of the                    final report.  The final report will be a joint report issued by                the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education.",
