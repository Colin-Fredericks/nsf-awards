 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impact of goldenrod-feeding insects on the growth and                  reproduction of individual stems and on field community                         composition during the course of succession will be studied.                    Insect populations will be surpressed in plots of newly cleared                 ground to determine whether feeding by insects affects which                    plant species become established in these plots.  To supplement                 this holistic approach, more detailed experiments will be                       performed on two members of the old field community, goldenrod                  and strawberry, to assess the role herbivores play in mediating                 the competitive outcome between the two.  A second objective is                 to examine in detail the effect of different types of herbivore                 feeding damage on the fitness of individual goldenrod stems.                    Experiments in which herbivore damage is simulated in various                   ways will allow the investigation of how insect damage disrupts                 the balance between carbohydrate sources and sinks within the                   plant.  In addition, because different herbivores are attracted                 to goldenrods growing at different fertility levels, experiments                will be conducted to assess the combined effect of soil fertility               and insect feeding style on plant fitness.                                           Long-term studies of the spatial and temporal variation in                 the populations of several insect species that feed on goldenrod                will be continued.  To gain further insight into the structure of               the fauna and the quality of the herbivore load at our various                  sites, experiments designed to determine the host finding                       abilities of several insect species will be conducted.  These                   data provide a context for interpreting the more focused                        experiments by allowing the frequency with which our experimental               conditions occur naturally to be determined.  They also form the                basis for building new hypotheses about the structure of the                    insect fauna of goldenrods and the interactions between species.",
