 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inducible defensive strategies against predators are demonstrably               important in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats;                      however, only in benthic marine systems have inducible defenses                 against competitors emerged as important mechanisms of                          interaction.  In addition to their ecological importance,                       inducible defenses are powerful tools for the analysis of                       allocation shifts within phenotypically plastic organisms and of                the evolution of defense and aggression.  This investigation will               employ an experimental approach to analyze proximate and ultimate               mechanisms of inducible defenses with the following three goals:                     1. To determine the size-specific costs and benefits of                    inducible responses to predators (spines) and competitors                       (stolons), independently and in combination.                                         2. To determine the translocation patterns underlying the                  highly localized growth and reproduction shifts associated with                 inducible defenses to predators and competitors using a common                  currency of carbon (14C radioisotope).                                               3. To assess the frequency of inducible defenses to                        predators (spines) and competitors (stolons) in two different                   geographic and productivity regimes with the ultimate goal of                   determining the relative biological selection pressures for the                 inducible defenses.",
