 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal is concerned with the MBE-growth of III-V                heterostructure material, and fabrication and characterization of a             novel selectively contacted dual channel modulation-doped field-effect          transistor based on the same material.  The research will be carried            out under a collaborative arrangement between the PSU Center for                Electronic Materials and Processing (CEMP), and the Electronic                  Technology and Devices Laboratory (ETDL), U.S. Army Electronics                 Research and Development Command, Fort Monmouth, NJ.  This effort will          be the third year of continuation of this project under the joint NSF           and U.S. Army Research Program.  A PSU senior graduate student working          under the PI will continue to utilize the extensive microelectronics            facilities at the ETDL in collaboration with its technical staff for            the fabrication of the identified test device structures.                                                                                                       The research efforts will involve optimization of the AlGaAs/GaAs               heterostructure layer growth, wafer fabrication of this new test                device structures, and their electrical characterization.  The aim is           to determine the mechanism of operation and performance limitations of          this new device as a novel switching component, and expand the basic            understanding concerning 2-D carrier transport within a                         heterostructure quantum well both in laterl and vertical directions.",
