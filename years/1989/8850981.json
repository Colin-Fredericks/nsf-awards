 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project; University/Industry Program for Teachers of                        Physics, is designed to modernize and deepen the science                        background of 30 high school physics teachers while providing                   them with teaching materials representative of topics of                        current scientific and technical interest.  The physics                         teaching modules which form the basis of the project were                       developed by teams of physics teachers working with Rutgers                     University faculty and industrial scientists from AT&T Bell                     Laboratories and Bell Communications Research.                                                                                                                  The Leadership Institute for Teachers of Physics is the                         central activity of the project.  The thirty physics                            teachers, selected nationwide, will attend a four-week                          residential program during July 1989.  The summer program                       includes laboratory work on the modules with the assistance                     of Lead Teachers and university faculty, a seminar series                       developed by university and industrial scientists, discussion                   of effective teaching strategies, and tours of leading                          research facilities.  In addition, selected Lead Teachers                       will continue to work with scientists on module development                     throughout the year.  This will involve the revision and                        testing of previously developed modules and the creation of                     new ones.                                                                                                                                                       To facilitate the use of the modules both in the classroom                      and at professional science education workshops, follow-up                      meetings will be held during the school year for regional                       teachers.  All 1989 Institute participants will be invited                      back for a one-week follow-up program in the summer of 1990.                    Participants will also be encouraged to communicate using                       PIMAIL, an interactive computer network sponsored by the                        American Institute of Physics.",
