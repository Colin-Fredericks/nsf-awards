 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Stanley S. Beus of Northern Arizona University (NAU) will                   direct 6-week in-service workshops for 26 science teachers                      (grades 6-12).  Workshops will begin in the summer of 1990                      and continue for 3-summers.  Each summer 6 participants                         identified as Master Teachers, may earn seven-graduate                          credits and 20 as \"Research Assistants\" may earn six-graduate                   credits.  Participating teachers will come from Arizona and                     other southwestern states.                                                                                                                                      The workshops have 3 two-week phases.  An intensive Phase I                     emphasizes content in biology and geology with classroom,                       laboratory and field experiences.  Phase II is a 12-day                         outdoor field-research camp in the Grand Canyon with a focus                    on biological and geological aspects as well as uses of the                     canyon and river (STS aspects).  During Phase III, back at                      NAU, participants guided by research scientists, will prepare                   their findings from Phase II and guided by master teachers                      will develop teaching materials based on the previous                           experiences.  It is intended that the teaching materials will                   translate the workshop experiences into using the outdoor                       resources of the home district; be it a canyon environment or                   a flat desert environment for earth-science instruction.                        Follow-up activities include a science activity manual with                     contributions from all participants, a Grand Canyon slide                       set, a bi-monthly newsletter, ongoing  electronic                               communications via CISCO-NET and a two-day workshop in                          Flagstaff.  Finally, Master Teachers will conduct two or more                   workshops in their home school districts for their peers.                       The Research Assistant teachers will attend one or more of                      these workshops.                                                                                                                                                This carefully crafted project uses a variety of                                teaching/learning techniques, reinforcement and support for                     both the well-prepared and underprepared science teacher.  It                   uses an exciting national resource yet customizes classroom                     activity material to make use of local outdoor resources.  It                   builds upon exemplary cooperation between NAU, local school                     districts, the National Park Service, the Bureau of                             Reclamation, the Museum of Northern Arizona, and private                        industry.  NSF support will enable teachers from Native                         American settlements to participate.  This focus, the                           cooperation and a study of resource management of this                          \"national treasure\" give the project a strong science,                          technology and society component and significant minority                       impact.                                                                                                                                                         There is cost sharing in an amount of $182,368 which is 50%                     of the NSF award.",
