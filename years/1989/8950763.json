 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fairfield University will purchase new equipment to support                a laboratory module centered on quantum effects in tunnel diodes,               Josephson junctions, Superconducting Quantum Interferences                      Devices (SQUIDs), and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM).                  The general plan is to introduce electron and super-pair                        tunneling phenomena as a unified laboratory experience.  These                  phenomena are increasingly important as a branch of modern                      physics, and have a strong influence in basic physics research,                 in state-of-the-art research instrumentation and in numerous                    areas of high technology.  Student capabilities will be developed               such areas of science and technology as bio-magnetic phenomena,                 surface physics and materials science.                                                                                                                               The incorporation of the module into an existing two-                      semester Advanced Experimental Laboratory at Fairfield University               will allow the curriculum to keep pace additional skills in the                 utilization of advanced laboratory instrumentation.                                                                                                                  As an additional benefit, upper division students will be                  able to utilize the new equipment for their required senior                     research projects, when appropriate to do so.  Finally, the                     experience gained by the students in this area of tunneling                     phenomena and in utilizing the proposed equipment, will have an                 impact on collaborative efforts between, the Physics Department                 and area high technology organizations.                                                                                                                              The University will match the award with an equal amount of                funds.",
