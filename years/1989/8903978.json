 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to define the nature of                       hormonal and developmental interactions that regulate ripening of               avocado fruit.  A hypothesis has been developed that considers                  the ripening process to consist of phases which are associated                  with action of the hormone ethylene.  These involve: 1) a lag                   during which the responsiveness of the tissue to ethylene                       increases, and during which a putative \"tree factor\" that                       inhibits ripening of undetached fruit is dissipated; and 2) a                   period of autocatalytic ethylene production, accompanied by                     macroscopic changes such as cell wall degradation.  This                        proposal will focus on definition of the regulatory events that                 produce the tree factor, and result in the ripening lag.  The                   possibility will be explored that the tree factor is auxin or a                 similar compound.  This research may provide useful insight into                the interactive roles of hormonal and non.hormonal signals in a                 major plant developmental process.",
