 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to assess the rate at which               particular genes ( \"t complex\") pass from parents to their                      progeny in field populations of house mice.  A \"+/t\" male                       produces sperm of both the \"+\" form and the \"t\" form of the t                   complex.  Most laboratory studies document that +/t males sire                  95% +/t pups and 5% +/+ pups.  This means sperm with the \"t\" form               of the t complex fertilize more eggs than sperm with the \"+\" form               of the t complex.  Recent studies show these fertilization rates                can be modified in the laboratory.  With newly available                        techniques from molecular biology, fertilization of sperm with                  the \"t\" form of the t complex can be assessed directly in field                 populations.                                                                         Dr. Baker will trap pregnant females in the field, then use                molecular biology techniques to assess the DNA of the pregnant                  females and their fetuses for the \"t\" form of the t complex.                    Preliminary data indicate that most field populations of house                  mice have +/t mice.  Understanding the dynamics of this widely                  distributed group of genes in house mice should provide insight                 for geneticists studying +/t laboratory mouse strains.  Just as                 important, how natural selection operates on this complex of                    genes should be elucidated.  The pilot work carried out here is                 expected to lead to the development of a more detailed, intensive               research proposal into the dynamics of the t complex.  This                     progression from a small preparatory phase to a well developed                  research project is one of the principal aims of the Research                   Planning Grant.",
