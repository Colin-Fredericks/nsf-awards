 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cycles of biogenic elements in the Ross Sea are unusual in a number         of respects when compared to other oceanic regions.  For example, the           seasonal cycle of primary productivity appears to be dominated by ice-          edge phytoplankton blooms which are controlled by the spatial extent of         the meltwater produced by the receding ice.  This bloom is highly               dependent on nitrate as a nitrogen source, and hence large amounts of           the bloom's production is available for export.   The Ross Sea, and the         western portion in particular, is also the site of extensive deposits of        siliceous sediments, and accumulation rates are the highest measured in         the world's oceans.  The diatomaceous component of the sediments also is        the same species which dominates the ice-edge phytoplankton bloom.              However, the sediments are not enriched in organic matter to the same           extent that they are in silica, and material collected in sediments             traps also appears to be enriched with silica relative to organic               matter.  This proposal seeks to investigate the production, vertical            flux, water column regeneration, and sediment accumulation rates in the         western Ross Sea in order not only to quantify these rates at one               location, but also to understand the mechanisms controlling the apparent        uncoupling of organic and siliceous matter cycles.  This project is one         component of a coordinated interdisciplinary study in the Ross Sea              Results from this study will document the apparently unique coupling            between the surface production and the accumulation in the sediments,           and will help clarify the reasons for the differences in the cycles of          organic and siliceous particulate matter.  Information obtained will            also greatly assist global models of production and sedimentation of            biogenic material.",
