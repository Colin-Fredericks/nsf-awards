 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been recognized for more than a decade that in spiral                    galaxies and in the present epoch stars form in giant molecular                 clouds, which typically are distributed along the spiral arms                   of the galaxies.  The question has been:  \"How do the stars                     form?\" The Principal Investigator (PI) of this grant proposes                   to study this formation process both observationally and by                     numerical modelling.  In particular, he proposes to investigate                 the Herbig-Haro objects in nearby molecular clouds, which are                   dense concentrations of gas and dust, within many of which                      stars seem to be assembled.  Furthermore, the newly forming                     stars appear to be surrounded by accretion disks and they                       reveal themselves by bipolar ejections of matter perpendicular                  to the accretion disks.  One of the PI's proposed projects is                   to investigate these bipolar flows.",
