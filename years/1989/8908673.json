 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to improve our ability to do                  automatic flexible assembly.  There are three objectives to this                end:  First, develop the science of part mating, with application               to flexible assembly system design.  Second, develop a                          quantification of dexterity which can be applied to model the                   assembly process, analyze assembly devices and synthesize                       assembly systems.  Finally, demonstrate the usefulness of                       dexterity as a common measure of assembly tasks and assembly                    devices.                                                                             The methods to be employed in this research will include the               analysis of the physics of assembly primitives and the mechanics                of assembly devices using screw algebra, and the development of                 dexterity models using parts entropy measures and an index of                   difficulty for position and force.                                                   Applications of dexterity research in engineering will                     initially take the form of a handbook of assembly system                        applications.  This should in turn stimulate design                             simplification of piece parts resulting in products which require               the least amount of dexterity needed.  Expected results include                 new robotic assembly devices, automatic path planning algorithms                which include complete descriptions of the assembly process, and                optimal assembly task location within the workspace.",
