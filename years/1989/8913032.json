 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will use the crayfish (Procambarus clarkii)               to address the role of fixed cells in the recognition of                        proteins, viruses, bacteria and red blood cells.  It will begin                 to test the hypothesis that a population of fixed cells in the                  gills of the crayfish is the critical component in the initial                  recognition and clearance of non-self cells and particles,                      whereas circulating hemocytes play a secondary, but critical role               in the elimination of foreign materials after they are                          concentrated into the gills.  Previous studies with the crayfish,               using a unique \"transfusion exchange\" technique to deplete                      circulating cells to less than 1% of normal levels in vivo,                     indicate that the transfused crayfish is quite capable of                       clearing a wide variety of non-self substances to the gills in a                normal manner.  In vitro studies indicate, however, that                        separated populations of granulocytic and agranulocytic hemocytes               are capable of recognizing (binding, phagocytosising) bacteria, red             blood cells and proteins.  The immediate goals of this project                  will be to define the morphological and functional properties of                the fixed cells lining the gill sinuses, i.e. to identify them as               podocytes or transiently fixed hemocytes.                                                                                                                       The results of this research should provide new insights into the               mechanisms of non-self recognition and self defense in an                       invertebrate, the crayfish, apparently lacking lymphocytes and                  immunoglobulins.  The proposed studies also will provide                        outstanding undergraduate students an opportunity to participate                in an ongoing research program, thus promoting their potential                  for graduate studies in the sciences.  In addition this project                 will continue to enhance the research environment of an                         undergraduate institution.",
