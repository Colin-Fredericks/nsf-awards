 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one year, full-time award enables a philosopher who has                    specialized in issues of ethics, policy and agriculture, to                     develop his capabilities in the area of agricultural economics.                 His research focuses on value assumptions in agricultural                       economics and in the teaching of agricultural economics, and on                 the ethical implications of those assumptions.  His host                        institution is the Agricultural Issues Center of the University                 of California, Davis.  The director of the Center as well as                    several other agricultural economists will act as advisors to the               project.  During the course of the award, the investigator will                 audit undergraduate and graduate courses in order to gain formal                training in the mathematics of agricultural economics.  This                    study will enable him to investigate whether and how these                      mathematical tools incorporate or express value assumptions and                 may magnify selected human impacts.  With guidance from his                     advisors, he will analyse textbooks, study their use in the                     classroom, and discuss the texts and their views of them with                   faculty.  He will examine relevant research, attend seminars and                lectures, and interview economists, in order to identify value                  assumptions that are incorporated in their work.  Based on his                  research, he will prepare papers, distribute them, and present                  them in seminars, for further discussion and evaluation.                        Publications will explore the implications of these findings for                teaching agricultural economics, and for enhancing the ability of               agricultural policy sciences to incorporate explicit attention to               values previously overlooked or treated as \"non-economic\" or                    \"externalities.\"                                                                                                                                                This project addresses a central issue in ethics and values                     studies in science, technology and society:  the impact of                      values on the development and use of scientific research.  The                  investigator and his host specialists and host institution are                  uniquely well-qualified to undertake and support this project;                  collaborative efforts are likely to continue after the period of                the award.  Results are likely to be appropriately disseminated                 and useful.  An award in the amount of $43,000 is therefore                     recommended.",
