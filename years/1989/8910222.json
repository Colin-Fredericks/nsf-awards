 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Opportunities for Women Research Planning Grant is                in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in                  the subfield of biosensors.  During the twelve month period                     beginning 1 September 1989, Professor McCloskey will draw both                  upon her expertise in synthetic and physical organic chemistry                  and upon a new, highly sensitive optical material that has been                 recently developed at the Georgia Tech Research Institute to                    carry out preliminary investigations on new sensors for                         bioanalysis.  Specifically, the Principal Investigator will                     evaluate this new optical material as the basis of an affinity                  based biosensor.  As a test system, biotin will be covalently                   attached to glass slides which will have been coated with the                   optical material.  Using waveguide techniques, the surface                      refractive index of this assembly will be measured in the                       presence and absence of avidin, which specifically binds to                     biotin.  In collaboration with workers at Georgia Tech Research                 Institute, Professor McCloskey will optimize the conditions for                 device preparation, the analytical reaction, and analyte                        detection. These activities should assist the Principal                         Investigator's change of research field and should contribute to                her establishing an independent research program at Agnes Scott                 College.                                                                                                                                                        The research area that will be explored in this project is                      broadly important to basic science and biotechnology.  The                      results of this work could lead to the development of new, highly               sensitive biosensors.",
