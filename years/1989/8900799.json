 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-standing honors program for 30 on-campus undergraduates                  has been successfully integrated with the NSF-REU site program.                 The combined program has increased the total number of student                  participants and provided resources for the recruitment of off-                 campus participants.  Continuation of the REU site permits the                  program to serve broadly as a state and regional Center for                     summer undergraduate research.  The specific goals of this                      activity are to provide in-depth research experience, guide                     talented students towards a research career, expose participants                to a variety of research, topics, and increase the ability of the               students to communicate research plans and results.  Research                   projects include: (1) supercooled liquid metal films for high                   resolution scanning, tunneling microscopy, (2) growth                           measurements on single cells, (3) bilayer film characterization                 of polymer blending systems, and (4) effect of gene amplification               in the rate of biocatalysis.",
