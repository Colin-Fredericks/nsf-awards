 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State of South Dakota is seeking assistance for its plan to:  (1)           improve the quality of basic research being conducted in the State              of South Dakota; (2) increase the number of Nationally competitive              scientists and engineers; and (3) effect the long-term improvement in           the research environment in the State of South Dakota.                                                                                                          To achieve these goals, the State EPSCoR Steering Committee has                 selected three primary research thrusts:  (1) Biomolecular                      Enhancement; (2) Materials Engineering and Science; and (3) Membranes           and Interfaces.  The participants in the three component proposals              who are primary targets for research development were selected                  through a comprehensive external evaluation of full research                    proposals.                                                                                                                                                      An aggressive statewide Management Plan (as amended) under the name             of REACH has been developed to monitor and stimulate the activities             of each center and to ensure that resources are directed toward the             program objectives during and beyond the funding period in order to             leave a legacy of EPSCoR in South Dakota.  The South Dakota EPSCoR              effort has the enthusiastic support of the university                           administrations, political groups and private citizens.  The extent             of this support can be demonstrated by the unprecedented matching of            $1.8 million (1:1) by the Governor of the State.",
