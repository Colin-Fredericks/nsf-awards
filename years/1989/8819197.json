A productive interaction between bacterium and               plant cell requires the appropriate attachment of the bacterium                 to the plant cell, and expression of a series of virulence (vir)                genes in the bacterium.  While the functions of several vir                     proteins are known, the mechanism by which the T-DNA is                         transported across two sets of cell walls and membranes is not                  known.  Recent data supports the hypothesis that the mechanism of               DNA transfer is analogous to that of bacterial conjugation,                     suggesting that a DNA transfer apparatus, such as the conjugal                  pore encoded by the F plasmid of E. coli, is involved.  The virB                operon is the logical candidate to encode the proteins of such a                pore.  The possible role of virB proteins in the transfer of T-                 DNA from the bacterium to the plant cell will be investigated                   using in vitro mutagenesis and recombinant DNA techniques,                      immunocharacterization and immunolocalization of the proteins,                  and biochemical approaches to determine whether or not the                      proteins are involved in physical interactions with bacterial                   membranes or DNA.                                                                                                                                               Currently, plant biotechnology is heavily dependent on gene                     transfer based on Agrobacterium.  Some plants are readily                       transformable by this vector, while others are not.  Thus,                      elucidating the mechanism of DNA transfer in this system will be                of great importance to plant genetic engineering.",
