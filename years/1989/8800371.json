 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of sulfide in the oxygen-rich near surface waters               of the North Atlantic.  The PI has found that contrary to                       predictions based on thermodynamics, oxic waters do contain                     measurable quantities of sulfide.  He intends to determine its                  diel, seasonal, and vertical distribution, and to investigate its               production and consumption. These investigations will help                      determine whether or not the ocean is a source or sink for                      hydrogen sulfide.   Part of the significance of this work is its                bearing on recent theories of the planetary climate control                     mechanisms.  Andreae, Lovelock, Bates, Charlson and others have                 proposed that reduced sulfur emissions from the ocean are a major               source of cloud condensation nuclei and thus are important in                   regulating the earth's albedo.  Although dimethylsulfide  may be                the major source of the reduced sulfur other sources must be                    investigated.  This project is such an investigation.",
