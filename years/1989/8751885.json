The goals of the project are (1)            improve the general background of the teachers by providing reliable            information \"classical\" as well as current advances in physics, (2)             improve classroom presentations of specific topics by providing                 important teaching aids, (3) prepare participants in teaching methods in        and the use of classroom demonstrations including the means to construct        necessary equipment and provision of materials, (4) prepare the more            experienced teachers to deliver \"in-service\" to colleagues in their own         schools and (5) provide opportunity for computer useage including a             survey of available computer software and interfacing capabilities.                                                                                             These goals will be accomplished (1) by an updated series of lectures,          with notes and diagrams provided, by University of California-Riverside         faculty chosen for their ability to present at a level appropriate for          the targeted group, (2) by individual participant selection of at least         30-40 teaching demonstrations to be constructed by the participants from        among 300 demonstrations presented and explained at the beginning of the        four-week Institute, (3) by group instruction on science teaching               methods using experienced University staff as well as experienced               \"mentor\" teachers, and (4) by the use of the Technical Education Center         of the Riverside County Public Schools.                                                                                                                         An amount equivalent to 23% of the NSF request is being cost-shared by          the UCR in contributing half of the salaries for instructional time and         all of the cost for the machine shop facilities required for the                participant construction of the demonstration material.",
