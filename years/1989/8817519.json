 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well recognized that abiotic \"stress\" may change plant               resistance to insects, but little is known about the mechanisms                 involved.  Recent studies demonstrated that a single, acute,                    ambient dose of ozone changes susceptibility of cottonwood to                   insects and diseases.  The leaf-chewing beetle, Plagiodera                      versicolora, is particularly affected.  Beetles prefer to feed on               and consume more of ozone-treated plants than controls, but do                  not grow or survive any better; relative growth (growth per unit                food eaten) is therefore reduced.  Females prefer to lay their                  eggs on control plants and have much lower fecundity when kept                  with ozone-treated plants.  The chemistry of cottonwood plants is               also changed by ozone.  Soluble nitrogen increases, phenolic                    glycosides decrease and other phenolics become polymerized to                   cell walls.  These chemical changes may be responsible for the                  \"stress\"-induced changes in insect resistance.  The chemical                    mechanisms responsible for changes in beetle feeding and                        oviposition preference, consumption, relative growth and                        fecundity will be investigated.  Chemical isolations combined                   with bioassays; and testing of specific compounds will be carried               out.  The dose response of the beetle to active compounds, and                  the time course in the plant following fumigation will also be                  determined.  These basic, mechanistic studies also have a                       pragmatic value because they will increase knowledge of the                     effects of air pollution on plant-insect interactions using                     commercially important species.",
