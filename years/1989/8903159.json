Participa-                    tion of scientists from developing countries will be                            supported in such workshops/meetings which are of mutual                        interest to SCOR, these developing countries, and the United                    States.  Topics of such workshops/meetings are likely to                        include: cycling of trace metals in estuaries; wave                             modelling; hydrothermal processes at plate boundaries;                          intercalibration of drifting buoys; and sea level change and                    its relationship to erosion of the world's coastline.  The                      SCOR staff will provide necessary planning, organization and                    follow-up for these meetings and will arrange for needed                        participation of developing country scientists.  The SCOR                       staff will provide analogous support for extensive planning                     activities related to the work of SCOR's Committee for the                      Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS).  The latter staff                        support will initially include planning and arrangements for                    a JGOFS North Atlantic Pilot Study.",
