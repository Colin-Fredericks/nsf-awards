 "awd_abstract_narration": "They propose to conduct a three-year study of the structure and                 properties of discotic liquid crystals and liquid crystal                       polymers.  Both known and new compounds will be synthesized,                    purified, and characterized optically and thermodynamically.                    Their structures will then be studied via x-ray diffraction, with               particular emphasis on single-domain, high resolution studies of                the columnar phases, in a suspended strand geometry.                                                                                                            Discotic liquid crystals are typically composed of molecules with               a rigid, disk-shaped core, and 4-8 flexible alkyl tails.  In                    addition to orientationally ordered nematic phases, these                       molecules can order into columnar structures, with long range                   two-dimensional positional order of the columns but only short                  range order along each column; such columnar phases can be                      thought of as complementing the one-dimensional smectic phases                  formed by many rod-like mesogens.  Although discotics have been                 studied for over a decade, little is known about the structural                 order, conditions for stability, and phase transitions of these                 unusual materials.                                                                                                                                              The materials to be studied include:  a) hexa-n-                                alkylthiotriphenylene and related analogs, which display an                     unusual transition from a disordered columnar phase to a closely                related helical incommensurate crystalline phase; b)                            phthalocyanine and related organometallic liquid crystalline                    compounds, which have potentially important applications as                     anisotropic organic conductors; and c) discotic liquid crystal                  polymers incorporating a variety of mesogenic units, including                  triphenylene, phthalocyanine, and \"Tubular\" cores.",
