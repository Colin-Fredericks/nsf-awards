 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together a major content area (geology)                     taught in earth science (ES) and its most effective method of                   study, activities in the field.  Content is emphasized in                       intensive sessions prior to arrival at the field sites near                     Lander, Wyoming and in evenings at the sites.  The \"hearing                     about\" and \"studying of\" classic geology features near Lander                   will be complemented by doing geology.  Teachers will be                        doing geology while photographing geological features,                          recording field observations and measurements, and collecting                   specimens for use in their classes.  In addition to the                         personal journal, slide sets, and collections; the project                      will result in a Geology of the State book, a Field Guide to                    the Geology of the State, and associated computer software.                                                                                                     Following the 3-week summer field experience the study of                       local geology will begin and continue into the fall.                            Participants will practice their new understanding of geology                   while examining the geology of a local site and developing                      activities to do with students at the site.  They will share                    their experiences and work at the local site by presenting at                   least one in-service program for  area teachers.                                                                                                                Field activities begin in the summer of 1989 for 20 Arkansas                    ES teachers.  During the 65 months of this project, this                        format is repeated for 20 teachers from Tennessee, Oklahoma,                    and Texas.  Instruction is by staff from the home university                    facilitated by the PI and field camp director for the field                     experience.  Each state has modified slightly the Arkansas                      program to meet its needs.  Participants will be middle or                      high school teachers who have completed at least one 3-                         semester course in geology, will be teaching earth                              science/geology the next year, have support to conduct a                        local field trip for students and are given released time to                    teach the in-service programs.                                                                                                                                  The synergistic effect of first hand experiences and teacher                    ownership of the geology learning tools will generate                           enthusiasm for both the teacher and students.  The materials                    customized for each state provide continuing support for                        participants and their peers.  Taken as a group they give the                   project a regional impact.  The model of an intensive field                     experience coupled with two customized books, focusing on the                   state's geology, and an associated computer program maybe a                     useful geology/earth science in-service model.                                                                                                                  There is cost sharing in the amount of $139,462 which is                        equal to 25% of the NSF award.",
