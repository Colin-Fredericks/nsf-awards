This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support five research                       projects in the Department of Mathematics at the University of                  California, Santa Barbara: Numerical Investigations of Nonlinear                Partial Differential Equations, directed by Bjorn Birnir;                       Combinatorial Classification of Classical Knots and Links,                      directed by Kenneth Millett; Numerical Experiments and the Theory               of Viscosity Solutions of Fully Nonlinear Equations, directed by                Michael Crandall; Singularities in Nonlinear Hyperbolic Systems,                directed by Thomas Sideris; and Character Varieties for                         Hyperbolic Manifolds, directed by Daryl Cooper.",
