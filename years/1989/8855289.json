 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Young Scholars Program at Wiley College designed to create a                learning environment that challenges the twenty participants                    intellectual abilities, and encourages the development of requisite             skills for the use of these abilities.  The proposed program consists of        an Summer Science Institute which focuses on research methodology,              career awareness, philosophy and ethics in chemistry and physics.  The          program also provides an academic year of follow-up activities via a            Saturday academy.                                                                                                                                               The objectives of the program are to: 1) present advanced topics to the         participants in chemistry and physics, 2) provide hands-on laboratory           experiences with state-of-the-art equipment, 3) develop in each                 participant, basic skills in writing computer software for controlling          instruments and collecting data, 4) engaging participants in meaningful         research and special laboratory projects, 5) provide \"mentor experience\"        for participants through organized field trips, and 6) expose precollege        students to cutting-edge research and intellectual frontiers by the             Distinguished Lecture Series.",
