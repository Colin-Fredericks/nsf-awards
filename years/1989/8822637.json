 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Jan A. Northby of the University of               Rhode Island for collaboration in research with Professor J. Peter              Toennies of the Max Planck Institute for Flow Research in Gottingen,            West Germany.  They are collaborating in the study of the properties            of microscopic helium clusters which are formed in cryogenic free jet           expansions.  Their approach involves producing and studying helium              cluster ions at the U.S. lab and neutral helium clusters at the                 German lab, then comparing results.  The broad objective of their               research is to examine the evolution of macroscopic phenomena, in               particular of superfluidity, as the number of atoms increases.  Their           current efforts are concentrated in developing the technology for               producing and characterizing helium cluster beams covering the size             range where departures from macroscopic behavior can be expected.               The German laboratory has two molecular beam machines dedicated to              helium cluster experiments and uniquely suited to the proposed                  collaborative research; however, they have only recently begun                  working with condensed helium.  Professor Northby has had considerable          experience with rare gas clusters initially formed as ions and has              benefited from Dr. Toennies expertise in molecular beam work.  The              complementary expertise and facilities of the investigators create a            very strong collaborative arrangement.                                                                                                                          Clusters of atoms form the bridge between atomic properties and the             properties of the bulk.  Interest in the study of size-dependent                properties in clusters of all kinds of materials has grown dramatically         in the past decade.  From the experimental side, this has been driven           by the development of free jet expansion techniques for the production          of cluster beams.  From the theoretical side, growth has been driven            by the tremendous expansion in computer power which now permits                 detailed ab initio calculations of the properties of quite large                finite systems.  The proposed research should lead to fundamental new           understanding of superfluidity and the transition of matter from the            atomic to the bulk state.  This could have a practical spin-off for             film growth and other areas.",
