 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the dynamics of cultural transmission can                         illuminate the means by which cultures maintain themselves or                   change over time.  This dissertation research will apply a new                  body of theory, gene-culture coevolution, to an investigation of                cultural transmission of a significant trait, food avoidances.                  Coevolutionary models are an extension of population genetic                    models reflecting the characteristics of cultural as opposed to                 genetic transmission.  The Lese, horticulturalists of the Ituri                 Forest, Zaire, are relatively isolated from mass media, making                  cultural transmission among them a matter of inter-personal                     contact -- and ideal situation for this kind of study.  The                     investigator will interview 300 individuals to elicit their set                 of food avoidances and food-related beliefs.  He will infer how                 individuals learn their food avoidances by estimating                           mathematical transmission models using this information.  He will               also test other hypotheses from the literature concerning the                   functions of food avoidances.                                                                                                                                   This research is important because it will test a theory of                     cultural transmission by applying the theory to non-Western                     people.  The knowledge gained from this project will help us                    understan how cultures are reproduced over time and the adaptive                significance of the pattern of reproduction.",
