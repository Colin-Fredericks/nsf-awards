Sinai Hospital in New York and Susana Puntarulo                             and Alberto Boveris, both in the Department of                                  Biochemistry at the University of Buenos Aires in                               Argentina.  Metals, especially ferric complexes are                             required to promote the formation of oxidizing species                          responsible for DNA and cellular damage.  This work                             will study the interaction of various ferric                                    complexes, including ferritin, with organelles such as                          isolated nucleii and their ability to catalyze the                              generation of oxygen-active radicals in rat liver                               nucleii.                                                                                                                                                        This collaborative effort will bring together the                               expertise of two laboratories concerned with the role                           of transition metals in catalyzing the production of                            active oxygen radicals by biological systems.  The                              work will provide new insights into oxygen radical                              formation and lipid peroxidation in such systems.",
