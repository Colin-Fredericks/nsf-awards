 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 3-year research program is a continuation of a previous study              dealing with the elucidation of the absorptive and secretory functions          of the crustacean gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.  Many crustacean          species are undergoing extensive aquaculture throughout the world.  One         of the major problems with the successful rearing of these animals from         egg to market is providing a cost-effective diet that leads to rapid            growth.  Prior to the initiation of this research program, little was           known about the absorptive functions of the crustacean gut and therefore        few recommendations could be made concerning the nature of an artificial        diet to provide cultured animals.  Previous work has used a variety of          in vitro techniques to study the various organs of the gastrointestinal         tract of these animals to obtain an understanding of how nutrients,             minerals, and water are absorbed during normal digestive processes.  The        present proposal will extend earlier studies by characterizing nutrient         transport mechanisms in the major absorptive organ of these animals, the        hepatopancreas.  Biochemical isolation techniques will be employed to           purify gut transporting membranes that bring about the uptake of dietary        components to study the characteristics of these uptake processes for           comparison with more thoroughly investigated systems in mammals.  In            addition, cultured cell preparations of the absorbing organs will be            used to quantify rates of transcellular absorption of sugars, amino             acids, and other important dietary compounds in these animals.                                                                                                  The second goal in this research program is to study the processes of           nutrient reabsorption by the crustacean kidneys to establish their roles        in metabolite conservation.  In mammals nutrients in the blood are              filtered and selectively reabsorbed back to the blood by the kidneys and        in this way potential toxins can be excreted and important nutrients            conserved.  Whether the same processes occur in the invertebrates as            well as defining the characteristics of reabsorptive processes will be          examined.  Similar membrane isolation and purification techniques and           cell culture studies will be employed with kidney cells as will be              associated with the gut organs discussed above.                                                                                                                 This 3-year study will provide a better understanding of how the gut and        kidneys of an economically important group of invertebrates contribute          to organismic growth.  Important basic scientific information about cell        physiology will be forthcoming from these studies, as well as potential         useful applied results that may aid in the successful rearing of these          animals under controlled conditions.",
