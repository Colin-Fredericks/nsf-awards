 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for fifteen United States                      ecologists to participate in the First Latin American Congress of               Ecology (10-17 December 1989; Montevideo, Uruguay) and to                       present research results at selected Latin American universities.               The field of ecology and the related disciplines of evolution and               behavior are undergoing rapid change.  At the same time, growing                national recognition of the problems of climatic change,                        biodiversity, and pollution is producing pressure for                           ecologically-sensible solutions, suggesting an unusually                        favorable environment for research leading to environmental                     problem-solving in the United States.  Unfortunately, the same is               not true of Latin America.  Devalued currencies and national                    debts have reduced the ability of ecologists to follow                          international developments at the same time that their                          contributions are most needed in addressing problems such as                    biodiversity, deforestation watershed protection, and pollution.                Such ecologists often lack access to journals, libraries, or                    colleagues.  There exists a need to increase the awareness of                   Latin American ecologists concerning recent developments in                     ecology and environmental science.  Such awareness would have                   obvious benefits to their own countries, but it would also have                 direct and indirect benefits to the United States.",
