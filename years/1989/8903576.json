 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Munck is continuing his state of the art Mossbauer and                      EPR studies on iron-sulfur proteins.  He is also developing a                   spin-coupling Hamiltonian for valence-delocalized systems.                      Work performed in the previous grant period has lead to the                     recognition that spin-coupling in valence-delocalized systems                   requires an additional mechanism, called double-exchange.  in                   attempting to buttress the new spin Hamiltonian by                              microscopic theory, Dr. Munck discovered a mechanism of                         exchange coupling (exchange-transfer).  He plans to now                         describe the various states of iron in as much detail as                        possible.                                                                                                                                                       Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopy, used in conjunction, with                       each other are well suited to elucidate the active site                         properties of iron-sulfur clusters.  A variety of iron-sulfur                   proteins are being studied, including nitrogenase, an enzyme                    system capable of reducing atmospheric nitrogen to                              ammonia.***//",
