 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Toolson has recently discovered that cicadas can reduce their               body temperature by evaporation of water.  This ability is known                only for a handful of insects.  What makes cicadas unique among                 all animals except mammals is that they achieve the high water                  loss rates required for evaporative cooling by means of an                      energy-dependent process that causes extrusion of water through                 large-diameter cuticular ducts.  The extrusion of water is                      triggered when a cicada's body temperature threatens to go above                a specific setpoint (Tsp), and is thus the functional equivalent                of sweating in mammals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The proposed research entails two somewhat distinct themes.                     First, extending the PI's discovery  that cicadas can                           evaporatively cool by activating an energy- dependent process                   that facilitates transcuticular water flux (TWF) rates, the PI's                will conduct studies to elucidate the chemical and                              neurological mechanisms involved in regulation of the TWF-                      facilitating process.  Compounds, such as aspirin, acetominiphen,               and prostaglandins, that have been shown to affect                              body-temperature regulation in mammals, and compounds with known                regulatory activity in insects, e.g., octopamine, will be tested                for their effect on TWF and, therefore, on body temperature.                    Localized regions of the cuticle will be warmed to determine if                 this affects TWF.  Classic ligation experiments will be used to                 assess whether the nervous system regulates TWF and, if so, at                  what level neurological regulation is mediated.  Finally,                       acclimation experiments and comparative studies involving cicada                species from a variety of habitats will be conducted to elucidate               the interaction of thermal regime, size, color/reflectivity, and                other factors in determining Tsp.  The second part of the                       proposed research consists of experiments designed to test                      between two alternative hypotheses proposed to account for the                  habitat-associated and seasonal patterns of cuticular                           permeabilities reported for most terrestrial arthropods.                        Cockroaches, crickets, and scorpions will be subjected to                       different combinations of food and water availability to                        determine whether the ability to modify cuticular permeability in               response to changing desiccation stress reflects a need to                      conserve energy/precursors or to regulate rates of TWF.",
