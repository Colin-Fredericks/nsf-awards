 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-range goal of this research project is to understand the               instructions carried by an animal's genes that make some cells                  excitable (like nerve and muscle cells) and other cells                         unexcitable (like gut and skin cells).  The genes not only carry                instructions on how to make special proteins (channels) that                    create the electrical currents (signals) in cells, but also                     instructions on which cells should make these channels and                      additional instructions to make other proteins that modify                      (modulate) the channel's function.  The studies will focus on the               fruit fly Drosophila because it has both an organized nervous                   system, similar to the human nervous system in many ways, and its               genes have been well studied and are easy to manipulate.  All of                the studies will be done on Drosophila nerve or muscle cells                    taken from embryos and grown in culture dishes, where they can be               studied by electrical techniques that allow direct measurement of               the function of the channels.                                                                                                                                   The first set of studies will involve the channels that carry                   either calcium ions or potassium ions.  These channels are                      especially interesting because they determine how many calcium                  ions enter the cell, which determines how strongly a muscle                     contracts and how much neurotransmitter is released by a nerve to               excite neighboring cells.  The techniques used allow the study of               single channels.  The number of different types of channels and                 the properties of each will be determined (how they respond to                  voltage, how many ions they transport, etc.)  The second set of                 studies will determine if the function of these channels can be                 modified by neurotransmitters applied to the outside of the cells               or \"second messengers\" inside the cells.  Current theories of                   learning hypothesize that learning involves modulation of channel               function by external and internal messengers.  Drosophila mutants               have been isolated that are poor learners and are missing                       particular proteins that control second messengers.  These                      mutants will be used to explore modulation mechanisms.  The third               set of studies will use the results of the first two sets of                    studies to identify genes that control the channels in nerve and                muscle cells.  Mutations which alter the animal's behavior will                 be studied to determine if they alter channel function.  Since                  these behavioral mutants can be mapped, the altered genes are                   identified.  If the mutant gene alters channel function, the gene               will be identified as one that codes for a channel, for a protein               that modulates a channel, or for a protein that determines the                  expression of a channel.  Channel-related genes will not only be                found from studies of behavioral mutants, but also from studies                 of deletions, individuals missing a small region of a chromosome.               Although these deletions are usually lethal to the animal, their                effect on channels can be studied in cultured cells.",
