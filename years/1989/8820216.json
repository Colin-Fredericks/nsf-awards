 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenomena of Circular Dichroism (CD) and Optical Rotatory                   Dispersion (ORD) are studied by chemists in order to gain                       special insight into the specific arrangement of atoms within                   molecules that possess the property of chirality.  A molecule                   is said to be chiral when it is not superimposable on its                       mirror image.  A crucial instrument used to study the phenomena                 is the CD/ORD spectropolarimeter.  Access to the instrument is                  essential to those chemists carrying out modern research                        involving chiral molecules.                                                                                                                                     This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                      Missouri at St. Louis to acquire a CD/ORD spectropolarimeter.                   The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the                     acquisition include the following:                                                                                                                              1) Structure and spectroscopy of high-symmetry aqueous                             lanthanide complexes                                                         2) Circular dichroism of organo-deuterium compounds                             3) Synthesis and structure of chiral thioaryl allenes                           4) Detecting conformational changes during iron removal from                       transferrin                                                                  5) Orientation of substrates and active sites in artificial                        enzymes.",
