 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses one of the most important problems                 in large-scale geodynamics, the fate of subducted lithosphere                   once it has penetrated below the depths of the deepest                          earthquakes.  The work will investigate deep slab structure from                its effects on the waveforms of seismic P and S waves. These                    effects include travel time advance, defocusing, multipathing,                  and diffraction.  Digitally recorded P and S waves will be                      analyzed by comparison with seismograms synthesized in three                    dimensional slab structures computed by theoretical methods.  The               structure of the descending lithospheric slabs below the cutoff                 in seismicity at 650 km depth is important to the understanding                 of the viscosity structure of the mantle and processes of whole                 mantle convection.  Because convection is the driving force                     behind plate tectonics and the world's earthquake activity, this                work is a contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard                        Reduction Program.",
