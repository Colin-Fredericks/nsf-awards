 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gold skarns have total gold production/reserves about four                 times greater than U.S. annual mine production and are the focus                of major exploration programs on several continents, yet little                 is known about their geology, mineralogy, geochemistry, or                      petrogenesis.  The proposed research will document the                          stratigraphic setting, petrology, mineralogy, fluid inclusion                   characteristics, trace element geochemistry, and stable isotope                 signature of the largest and most economically important gold                   skarn in the world.                                                                  The basic approach for the study will be detailed geologic                 mapping.  The importance of a clastic rich, carbonaceous,                       carbonate sequence may play a key role in the evolution of the                  hydrothermal system, buffering subsequent calc-silicate and                     sulfide mineral assemblages.  These reducing conditions are                     reflected in the ferrous iron dominant calc-silicate assemblages                and reduced sulfide species.  Preliminary work indicates that                   pyroxenes from many gold-bearing skarn systems tend to be more                  iron-rich (up to pure hedenbergite) and amphiboles and garnets t                end to be more aluminum-rich, than most other skarn types.  One                 of the goals of this study is to establish a genetic model for                  the evolution of the Fortitude gold skarn deposit; in particular,               to answer the questions, \"What is a gold skarn?\"  \"How does one                 form?\", and \"What exploration criteria can be used for their                    discovery?\"  At present these important scientific and economic                 questions cannot be answered.  The research outlined in this                    proposal is designed to find the answers using the most important               and well exposed system.",
