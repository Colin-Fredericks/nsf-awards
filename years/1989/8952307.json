 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project upgrades the quality of laboratory instruction                in analytical chemistry at IUP by the purchase of a modern atomic               absorption spectrometer.  This project has a beneficial effect on               the professional education of all the students majoring or                      minoring chemistry or chemical education, as well as on the                     medical technology majors and many related fields.  Included in                 this project are a variety of specific laboratory exercises in                  flame, electrothermal, and cold-vapor techniques of atomic                      absorption spectrometry.  Students also sue this instrument in                  undergraduate research in projects such as trace heavy metal                    analysis of environmental samples and development of new                        techniques for preconcentration/speciation of traces of metal                   species in solution.  The instutution is matching the NLSF grant                with an equal amount of funds.",
