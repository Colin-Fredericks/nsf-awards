 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                      California at San Diego to acquire a high-field NMR                             spectrometer.  The areas of chemical research that will be                      enhanced by the acquisition include:                                                                                                                            1) Molecular mechanisms of biological oxygen transport and                         utilization                                                                  2) Dynamics of metalloenzyme reactions                                          3) Synthesis of biologically active compounds                                   4) Proton transfer reactions in chemical and biological systems                 5) Catalytic hydrolysis of phosphate diesters and                                  oligonucleotides                                                             6) Chemical defense in marine organisms                                         7) Natural products chemistry of marine molluscs.",
