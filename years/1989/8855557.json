 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on the success of the STRIVE pilot                          program of Oak Ridge Associated Universities and replicates                     it at eight U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories.                       During each summer of 1989, 1990, and 1991, 50 middle and                       senior high school science and mathematics teachers will                        engage in full-time research on projects of national                            importance.  They will also participate in workshops designed                   to explore innovative ways to more effectively communicate                      the nature of scientific research to students.  The workshop                    sessions will also provide an opportunity to develop resource                   materials for use in their classrooms. Six hours of academic                    credit in education will be granted through the University of                   Tennessee.  Participants will earn additional credits in the                    research discipline.                                                                                                                                            A complementary set of academic year activities encourage                       past and present participants to interact with each other and                   with laboratory scientists.  They are:                                                                                                                               Newsletter.  A twice a year newsletter will facilitate                     ongoing contact between all participants and lab scientists.                                                                                                         Visiting Scientist Program.  Lab scientists who worked                     with the teachers will visit schools of the teachers.  During                   the visit they will give classroom                                              presentations/demonstrations, help with student projects, and                   work with students or teachers.                                                                                                                                      Presentations.  In-service sessions and other                              presentations to teachers, administrators, and parents will                     be made by the teachers based on their research experience.                                                                                                          Database Access.  ORAU will explore ways to provide                        STRIVE teachers with continuing access to information about                     laboratory research activities.                                                                                                                                 Dr. Wayne Stevenson of Oak Ridge Associated Universities is                     the Project Director.  He served as Co-Director for the pilot                   project.
