 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. C.                   Russell Hille, Ohio State University and Dr. Robert F. Anderson,                Gray Laboratory, Mount Vernon Hospital, Middlesex, England.  The                investigators will carry out a study of the oxidation-reduction                 behavior of milk xanthine oxidase, a well-defined enzyme of                     importance in metabolism.  Xanthine oxidase contains four sites                 capable of reversibly accepting reducing equivalents during                     catalytic turnover.  A total of six reducing equivalents are                    required to fully reduce all these centers.  The enzyme thus                    provides an excellent opportunity to examine the principles                     governing biological electron transfer as a system in which the                 sites are held at a fixed distance and orientation to one another,              within a more or less rigid polypeptide matrix.                                                                                                                 The principle technique to be used in this work is pulse                        radiolysis, a technique whose utility in studying biochemical                   oxidation-reduction problems is not widely appreciated.  It is                  anticipated that the results of this work will have implications                beyond xanthine oxidase alone, and will prove relevant to other                 more complex systems, such as those occurring in the mitochondrion              and chloroplast.  The demonstration of the general suitability of               pulse radiolysis in the study of intra-and interprotein electron                transfer would provide the field with a powerful new technique for              the study of these fundamental biological processes.  The British               collaborator is a recognized expert in pulse radiolysis and has a               long standing interest in the application of pulse radiolysis to                the study of electron transfer processes in biologically important              molecules.  The project will also benefit from state-of-the art                 pulse radiolysis facilities available at the Gray Laboratory.  Dr.              Hille's expertise is in oxidation-reduction enzymology and enzyme               kinetics.",
