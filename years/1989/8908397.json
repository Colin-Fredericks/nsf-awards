 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI of this Career Advancement Award/ROW is a young researcher with          great potential.  She is dedicated to the study of the optical                  properties of glasses and their applications.  In addition, she is              involved in III-IV compound semiconductor technology and integrated             optics.  Her ideas along superlattice disordering is particularly               worthy of note and her expertise in X-ray analysis (EXAFS) make her             very much a prime candidate for this Career Advancement Award.  Her             proximity to the many optically related projects at the Institute of            Optics and her strengths in both materials and optics also add                  substantially to the potential success of her proposal.  Moreover, she          has had a fine career to date with considerable experience with                 industry.",
