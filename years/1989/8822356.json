 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective risk communication has been shown to depend on a number               of factors, including the level of involvement of the audience,                 the relevance of the message for the audience and the ability of                the audience to process the information.  The objective of this                 project is to explore the determinants of risk relevance in a                   series of pilot studies.  It begins with the assumption that                    judgments of relevance are based on the similarity between the                  object of the relevance judgment (an individual or community,                   etc.) and the object of the risk information.  For any                          individual, information about oneself is most relevant.  Relative               to expert judgments, public judgments of relevance can be valid                 or biased, i.e. based on features of similarity that are not                    related to the level of risk faced by the individual.  To test                  this theory of the determinants of relevance, the features of                   similarity will be manipulated in a laboratory setting.  This                   should reveal what features of similarity have the most effect on               relevance and risk.  Further, an information acquisition task                   will permit the study of how relevance judgments are made as well               as the relations between relevance and denial.  Focus-group                     discussions will help in understanding how relevance is dealt                   with spontaneously in interpersonal settings.  Self descriptions                will provide information about the features individuals use to                  characterize themselves in varying contexts.  Finally, the                      judgments of expert risk analysts will used as the basis for                    assessing the validity of lay judgments of relevance. All these                 pilot studies will be used to develop a theory of relevance in                  risk communication and to refine methods for its study.  Not only               does this research promise to advance thinking about risk                       information and response to it, but it is also likely to have                   broader application to other areas of information processing and                reception.",
