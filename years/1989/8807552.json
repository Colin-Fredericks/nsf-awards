 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nature reserves have been recognized as an important means of              preserving a diverse range of biological species, but such protected            areas have generally been selected on a site-by-site basis.                     Ecologists and biogeographers have a growing sense that ecological              sustainability and adaptability also are important criteria that must           be met to maximize the benefits of reserves, and that a complementary           set of reserves (rather than an unrelated collection of independent             sites) offers the greatest potential for preserving the largest number          and broadest range of plant and animal species.  This doctoral                  dissertation research project will test the hypothesis that a system of         nature reserves, which is systematically selected using prevailing              principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, will be more          effective in preserving biological species than will traditional means          of selecting reserves one at a time.  The hypothesis will be tested             through development of a small-scale geographic information system              (GIS) into which data for a case study area on two large islands in             Western Samoa will be loaded.  These data on vegetation, animals,               soils, other physical characteristics, human features, and land                 ownership will be analyzed to determine a set of core sites and                 connecting corridors on each island to constitute the bases of systems          of nature reserves.  The resulted sets of reserves will be                      systematically compared with each other, with randomly generated                hypothetical networks, and with networks based on research by other             scholars.  These analyses then will provide the basis for development           of general geographic models to describe the locales that should be             included in a system of reserves that best preserves flora and fauna.              The practical results of this research will include the                      development of a specific plan for nature reserves for possible                 implementation by the Western Samoan government.  Of far greater long-          term benefit, however, is the specification of a general geographic             model for species preservation through a network of nature reserves.            This model can be simulated for other sites using independent data in           order to determine its generalizability, therefore providing a broader          base of understanding of how systems of nature reserves can alter rates         of change among plant and animal species.",
