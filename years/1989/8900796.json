 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for               Undergraduates Site at the Department of Biochemistry at the                    University of Arizona.  The department is comprised of 35 faculty               actively engaged in a variety of research projects.  The                        Department vigorously supports undergraduate research both                      through its participation in the University Honors programs and                 through the requirement of a senior research thesis for all its                 B.S. students. The participating faculty have published or                      submitted 58 papers co-authored by undergraduates in the last                   five years.  During the summer of 1988 the Department developed a               Summer Undergraduate Research Program, funded from local                        resources.  In conjunction with the Undergraduate Biochemistry                  Club, sponsored by the Department, a forum has been created which               permits students to communicate their research results to each                  other and to participating faculty.  The current award is for                   year-long support for 10 additional students.  The rationale for                supporting these 10 students during the summer and the academic                 year is two-fold: 1) It offers the opportunity to attract                       minority students into a research experience by paying them the                 money they may need to attend college; and 2) it provides an in                 depth experience for highly qualified and motivated students.                   The Department plans to capitalized on its unique location in the               Southwest to target its minority recruiting to women and                        Hispanics.",
