 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to use the coherence properties of a laser                  beam to control the product distribution in the photodissociation               of small molecules.  The approach relies on the theory of Shapiro               and Brumer that product state distribution is determined entirely               by the phase of the degenerate superposition state excited by the               laser, so that controlling the phase controls the product                       branching ratio.  It is proposed to achieve phase control of the                excited state by using two optical paths to excite the same                     state, with a well defined phase difference between the two                     optical pulses, corresponding to absorption of a single photo or                three photos.  The approach will be applied to the competition                  between autoionization and photo dissociation, and also to the                  photo dissociation of an isotopically labelled molecule to                      produce isotopically distinguishable neutral fragments.                         Oscillations is product branching ratios as the relative phases                 of the two laser beams is scanned will provide proof of coherent                laser control.",
