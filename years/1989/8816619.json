 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is part of a broader, multi-institutional                    study to monitor and analyze contemporary surface deformation due               to an active continental hot spot.  The project currently                       involves direct participation from MT, University of Utah,                      National Geodetic Survey (NGS), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),                  and ETH-Zurich.  An extensive crustal deformation experiment was                completed in the vicinity of the volcanically and seismically                   active Yellowstone Hot Spot in 1987 involving 80 GPS sites, 15                  EDM points, 620 km of releveling, and 160 precise gravity                       observations.  The present work focuses on deformation in the                   Hebgen Lake region and includes monitoring rapid horizontal and                 vertical surface movements associated with the Hebgen Lake                      earthquake and strain accumulation (and release in the event of                 an earthquake) across a number of Cenozoic normal faults.  2                    repeat surveys of the Hebgen Lake GPS network will be carried out               during the next 3 years.  Both of these surveys will likely be                  done in collaboration with NAGS and USGS.",
