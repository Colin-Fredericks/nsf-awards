 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on two tasks, completely decentralized                    control of cooperating multiple robots sharing the same workload,               and control of robots in space.  Typically for cooperating                      robots, each robot is controlled by its own control module in a                 parallel manner.  However, there is a real time communication                   channel, comprising a common bus structure, between modules to                  enable coordination between control modules.  For this                          configuration, the robots are said to be centralized.                           Unfortunately, for some conditions, i.e., when the robots are                   made by different manufacturers or when the controllers are                     located far apart, providing a common bus is not possible.  It                  then becomes necessary to completely decentralize the control                   scheme, that is , have them operate independently of each other.                This project investigates a method for achieving that goal.  The                conjecture is that each robot can accurately estimate the action                of the other by sensing the motion of the object being handled,                 and by sensing the interaction force between itself and the                     object.  This hypothesis will be tested as the first task in this               project.  In the second task, the intent is to deal with the                    problem associated with the dynamics effects associated with                    interaction between a robot and the space system which it is in                 contact with.  The research goal is to devise a scheme whereby                  both the robot and space system remain stationary in the large                  during interactions between the two.",
