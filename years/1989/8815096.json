 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. Daniel Hastings of the Massachusetts               Institute of Technology to collaborate with Prof. Kyoichi Kuriki and            co-workers at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science,                 Kanagawa, Japan, over a period of two years.  They will investigate             the problem of destructive current flows that often arise between the           plasma that exists in space, and charged metal surfaces such as occur           in high-voltage solar energy arrays.                                                                                                                            The purpose of this research is to develop a comprehensive theoretical          description of the interaction between the space plasma and high                voltage surfaces, with the specific aim of providing preflight                  predictions for a Japanese high-voltage solar array that is to be               tested in space in 1993.  The U.S. researchers will perform computer            simulation of the geomagnetic fields arising from the array, and                their effect on the space plasma.  Their Japanese collaborators will            attempt to confirm the analytical results by laboratory experiment              and subsequently iterate array design to minimize any problems                  predicted. The results of this research will have important impact on           the design of future spacecraft, and on the understanding of problems           which have already occurred with several U.S. spacecraft.",
