 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deals with the development of finite element                   solidification simulation software for the prediction of                        shrinkage defects in near and near-eutectic commercial ductile                  iron castings.  In order to accomplish this goal, two fundamental               problems must be solved.  First, the solidification of eutectic                 alloys which occurs essentially at constant temperature is                      inherently more difficult to simulate than that of freezing range               alloys because of the discontinuity in the enthalpy-temperature                 relationship.  Secondly, the solidification behavior of ductile                 iron, perhaps the most complex of the common casting alloys, is                 extremely sensitive to metallurgical processing conditions and                  hence not at all amenable to modeling on the basis of fundamental               considerations.  It is proposed that both problems may be                       overcome by a novel application of Newtonian analysis of cooling                curve data to obtain a heat generation function that directly                   accounts for unique solidification characteristics of a given                   alloy attributable to metallurgical processing practice which can               be efficiently incorporated into finite element solidification                  simulation code to realistically model the liberation of latent                 heat during solidification.  A significant impact on the foundry                industry as a whole is anticipated from this work, and for the                  first time provides a direct link between computer-aided design                 based on numerical simulation and process control in the foundry                based on thermal analysis.",
