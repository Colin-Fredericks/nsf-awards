 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine the role of                       colloid particle size and stability on performance of                           membranes used in water and wastewater treatment process.                       While models for particle transport in membrane modules                         have been developed which treat transport mechanisms                            individually, no model has yet been proposed which combines                                                                                                     these mechanisms nor has the interaction between these                          mechanisms been evaluated experimentally to produce an                          complete picture of the conditions under which colloids may                                                                                                     reduce the flux across membranes.                                                                                                                               Particle transport by Brownian diffusion, shear-induced,                        and lateral migration in a flat plate membrane module will                      be studies using pressure field-flow fractionation                              techniques.  By this method, a pulse of particles is                            introduced at the inlet to a porous channel.  The particle                      concentration response in the outlet of this idealized                          membrane module is monitored over time using UV absorbance                      and checked against electrical sensing zone and photon                          correlation measurements.  The retention time of particles                      in the channel can be compared with the retention time                          calculated assuming a single mode of back-transport.                            Particle size and permeation rate through the membrane will                                                                                                     be varied to produce conditions that favor transport by                         each of these mechanisms.  The effect of electrokinetic                         interactions on back-transport will be evaluated by                             performing identical experiments with charged and uncharged                                                                                                     particles.                                                                                                                                                      The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                             response to NSF 88-99, Research Initiation Awards.  The                         proposed work may lead to improvements in the Engineering                       design of membrane and process using membranes for                              treatment of water and wastewater used industrially and                         municipally.",
