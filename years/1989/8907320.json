 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charge coupled devices (CCDs) with high sensitivity throughout                  the vacuum ultraviolet, ultraviolet (UV), visible, and near                     infrared wavelengths are necessary for many proposed                            investigations in astronomy.  The best technical approach to                    improve CCD sensitivity in these wavelengths is backside                        illumination, but such devices with high sensitivity are                        not available, commercially or otherwise.  Commercial backside                  illuminated CCDs produced currently and in the past have                        exhibited many problems including low sensitivity, spatial and                  temporal variations in sensitivity, and optical distortion and                  interference.                                                                                                                                                   Recently, the need for UV sensitive CCDs for space flight                       applications has prompted research into methods to improve                      backside illuminated CCD technology.  The backside charging                     treatments developed through this research has proved promising,                but several problems still exist before sensors with the desired                characteristics are produced.                                                                                                                                   The Phase I research explored the problems and tradeoffs of CCD                 thinning and backside charging.  The results obtained were                      promising and insightful, however two significant areas need to                 be further investigated.  These are the problem of quantum                      efficiency hysteresis and the use of antireflection coatings to                 reduce reflection losses.  Under this Phase II SBIR Award,                      quantum efficiency hysteresis will be reduced by chemically                     modifying the backside surface oxide.  Antireflection coatings                  will be applied to the backside surface to reduce reflection                    loss, interference fringing, and protect the backside surface                   from contamination.",
