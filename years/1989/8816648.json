 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of the rates and mechanisms of feldspar                   dissolution is critical to accurately model the role of silicate                weathering in the biogeochemical cycling of H, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Si,               and Al.  We are proposing an interagency, interdisciplinary                     project to study the mechanisms of plagioclase dissolution                      reactions occurring under natural and laboratory conditions.  The               objectives are to (i) determine the composition of surface layers               of naturally and laboratory weathered plagioclase grains from the               same parent material using a combination of surface sensitive                   techniques including X-ray photoelectron and Auger electron                     spectroscopy (XPS, AES), and (ii) compare dissolution rates of                  plagioclase determined under laboratory conditions to rates                     calculated from chemical denudation in watersheds of the Silver                 Creek study area in the southwestern Idaho batholith.  We will                  examine the spatial variability of cation depletion and                         preferential release of cations from calcic or sodic rich zones,                and relate these surface processes to proposed hypotheses for the               stoichiometry of plagioclase weathering in well characterized                   watersheds of the Silver Creek study area.  Results from this                   study will contribute to our understanding of the extent and                    lateral distribution of altered surface layers and their role in                controlling rates of plagioclase dissolution.  Information                      obtained in this project will provide a framework for relating                  surface processes to measurements of mass balance and chemical                  denudation made at the watershed scale.",
