 "awd_abstract_narration": "The site of Tell Leilan, located in Northeastern Syria, has                     yielded a settlement history which covers the period from ca.                   5,000 to 1,700 B.C.  This sequence documents the rise of empires                in the Mesopotamian region and the transformation of small scale                chiefdoms into this larger scale, more centralized form of social               organization.  Ms. Laura Calderone, under the supervision of her                dissertation advisor Dr. Harvey Weiss, will excavate two squares                through stratum 17, 18, and 19.  These layers encompass the                     Ninevite 5 period which, excavators believe, marks the crucial                  transition period.  Both architectural and artifactual data will                be collected.  With these materials, Ms. Calderone will be able                 to examine such issues as changes in production and the                         development of social hierarchies.  It will also be possible to                 determine the importance of inter-regional trade through analysis               of imported items.  Finally, the presence or absence of defensive               walls, weaponry, and burning will provide insight into the extent               of warfare through the Ninevite period.                                                                                                                         Northern Syria lies on the periphery of the Mesopotamian region                 and is not in the heartland of early state and empire                           development.  Given the unpredictable rainfall and marginal                     agricultural conditions, it strikes many archaeologists as                      strange that empires developed there at all.  There is little                   agreement on why this process occurred.  Ms. Calderone believes                 that sites such at Tell Leilan mark secondary states which arose                in response to competition with Early Dynastic Southern                         Mesopotamia for control of trade and communication routes.  This                competition, she argues, caused a need for increased security and               social cohesion, and this necessitated a major reorganization in                social structures.  Excavation of the Ninevite layers will allow                her to test this hypothesis.                                                                                                                                    This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of how complex societies such as our own developed.               It will also assist in the training of an extremely promising                   scientist.",
