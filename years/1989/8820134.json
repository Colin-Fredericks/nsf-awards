Dissertation topic:                       \"Radiation, human heredity and the work of the Atomic Bomb                      Casualty Commission, 1947-1956.\"                                                                                                                                Ms. Lindee is examining the study by American scientists of the                 genetic damages on human populations of the atomic bomb blasts at               Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II.  The study                   attempted to track genetic damage in the offspring of survivors                 of the atomic bombings.  This genetics study was unique                         scientifically, socially and politically.  The tensions that                    shaped it included the developing Japanese-American relations,                  the expectations and fears of those exposed to A-Bomb radiation,                the professional goals of participating scientists, and the                     military's need for immediately useful information about the                    effects of radiation.  There pressures all affected scientific                  choices made by ABCC investigators.  Ms. Lindee hopes to study                  how the various political, social, and military pressures led                   genetics researchers to focus their attention on radiation                      mutagenesis primarily in terms of its social costs.  She will                   also examine the implications of this focus for understanding the               post-war development and institutionalization of American human                 genetics as a whole.",
