The goal of this REU program is               to provide research experience, training and career perspective                 for undergraduate students through the use of unique field sites,               laboratory facilities and the association and active involvement                in research with full-time research ecologists.  Project                        participants will examine the influence of by-products of nuclear               and fossil fuel energy production on selected biological and                    chemical properties in southeastern ecosystems.  SREL faculty                   members, all actively engaged in research and publication, will                 be paired with students having compatible research interests.                   Student projects, while distinct and independent, are portions of               ongoing research programs of SREL.  The student experience is                   enhanced by interaction with a programmatic team comprising                     individuals with a diversity of ecological backgrounds, interests               and ideas.  Applicants from minority schools and regional                       institutions with limited research programs will continue to be                 actively encouraged.  Participant selection is based upon the                   quality of an application, letters of recommendation and academic               record.  Through the research training of more than 380                         undergraduate participants over the past 22 years, SREL has                     created a highly successful program of student/advisor                          interaction.",
