 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central aim of this proposed research is to provide a                  critical reappraisal of so-called empirical laws of trophic                     structure in real ecosystems.  In collaboration with researchers                at the University of Wisconsin Trout Lake Station, and the                      Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the first whole-system               data base designed specifically to represent the trophic                        structure of a large-scale ecosystem will be assembled.  Because                aquatic environments represent the largest fraction of systems                  upon which the food web laws are based, this effort will focus on               Little Rock Lake, a long-term study site which has been                         extensively studied as part of an ongoing experimental acid rain                monitoring project, and which promises to yield a suite of 24                   highly detailed food web data sets.  A pilot study confirmed the                availability of a surprisingly large amount of trophic                          information here and the relatively high degree of taxonomic and                temporal resolution that could be attempted.  Amount the details                that will be included in this study are:  a full and more even-                 handed resolution of the species involved and their feeding                     intensities; temporal variability in food web structure with                    season and ontogeny; the effects on food web patterns of studying               incomplete subsystems; and the variation in food web structure                  introduced by systematically changing the resolution of the data                through aggregation and the incorporation of major to minor                     interactions.  The following are some of the questions being                    asked.  How representative of real systems ar ethe data upon                    which many food web generalizations are based?  How dependent are               food web properties on the temporal and taxonomic resolution of                 the data?  When is a property such as food chain length truly                   limited by the environment or simply by the quality of the data?",
