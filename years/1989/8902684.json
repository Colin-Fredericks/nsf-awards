 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beginning ca. 1,000 A.D., the Yanamarca Valley, located in the                  central Peruvian highlands, saw the rise of a complex                           civilization which was eventually conquered and incorporated into               the Inca Empire.  Years of excavation by a team of American                     archaeologists has resulted in a detailed reconstruction of this                process and recovery of cultural materials from a series of sites               which span this interval.  Included among these are objects                     fashioned from silver and lead together with ores, slag, and                    manufacturing debris.  These provide an unprecedented opportunity               to gain insight into prehistoric Andean metallurgical practices.                Working together, Dr. Ann LeHuray and Ms. Ellen Howe will                       conduct a metallographic, chemical, and lead-isotope study of the               silver and lead metal objects and a lead-isotope study of nearby                potential sources of ore.  This will allow them to describe the                 types of ores exploited, the manufacturing processes used, and                  patterns of exchange.  These can be followed over time and the                  effects of incorporation into the Inca empire can be determined.                                                                                                Many archaeologists have speculated on the mechanisms used by                   empires to incorporate subjugated populations.  Some argue that                 the Inca allowed local groups a high degree of autonomy while                   others believe that basic changes in economic and social                        organization took place.  However, it has been extremely                        difficult to collect information to test these alternatives.  The               metallurgical study by LeHuray and Howe will help to fill the gap               because it will be possible to see whether new fabrication                      techniques are introduced and new sources of ore used.  Thus,                   examination of metallurgical technology will provide insight into               social context.                                                                                                                                                 This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of how empires develop and maintain their control.                It will also shed new light on the history of metallurgy and the                role of technology in relatively simple societies.",
