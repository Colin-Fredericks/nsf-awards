 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of mantle fluids and relative stabilities of                         carbonaceous phases (diamond, graphite, carbonate, fluid) are                   partly determined by oxidation state.  Diamonds are of particular               interest in understanding how oxygen fugacity varies in the upper               mantle because while most appear to have been transported from                  relatively oxidized parts of the Earth, some contain extremely                  reduced mineral inclusions (e.g., iron metal, moissanite).  These               inclusions and the diamonds that contain them must record a                     different oxidation state than and be petrogenetically unrelated                to the kimberlites that brought them to the surface.                            Published data and a pilot experiment indicate that measurable                  quantities of oxygen dissolve in diamond.  Therefore, diamonds                  equilibrated under a range of oxygen fugacities may contain                     measurably different amounts of oxygen.  The pints of this                      investigation are to: (a) determine the solubility of oxygen in                 diamond; (b) determine if there are systematic variations in                    diamond oxygen contents that can be used as qualitative                         indicators of oxygen fugacity; and (c) search for relationships                 between diamond oxygen contents and other characteristics, such                 as inclusion assemblages, nitrogen contents, isotopic                           compositions and localities.  Among the questions to be addressed               are, do diamonds with reduced inclusions contain less oxygen than               those without such inclusions; what is the significance of the                  occurrences of moissanite, a mineral which should be stable only                under much more reduced conditions than thought to exist in the                 mantle; might variations in oxygen fugacity in part control the                 variability in nitrogen contents and carbon isotopic compositions               of diamonds.  Oxygen will be analyzed at Los Alamos National                    Laboratory.",
