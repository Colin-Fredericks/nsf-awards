 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field and archival data on indigenous Micronesian farming systems and           several physical environmental factors will be brought to bear on               three anthropological issues:  1) the extent to which these farming             systems are optimal adaptive solutions to the problem of land-based             subsistence, given the tropical island environments in which they               occur, 2) the extent to which the present Micronesian high island               landscapes, and past landscape changes through time, can be attributed          to prehistoric farming, and 3) the extent to which farming systems              research in Micronesia can contribute to a practical understanding of           the reasons for successes and failures in agricultural technology               transfers from first to third world cultural systems.                                                                                                           Dr. Hunter-Anderson will offer an upper division course in Pacific              archaeology and a seminar on appropriate field work strategies.                 Additionally, she will organize a cross-country teleconference                  featuring women anthropologists, active and retired, from a variety of          occupations.  The teleconference will enable these successful women             scientists to share their experiences and perspectives.                         Dr. Hunter-Anderson will also give guest lectures at other UC campuses          and in the local community.                                                                                                                                     This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
