The proposed study entails a two-year program of research                       incorporating                                                                     1) documentary and archival research,                                           2) content analyses of print and broadcast media and                            3) in-depth personal interviews.                                                                                                                              The preliminary activities will provide the essential investigatory             and background research to design a more specific and manageable                proposal for funding the primary study.  The research activities for            the planning grant period will involve three stages:                              1) preliminary documentary and archival research;                               2) preliminary personal interviews with governmental and media                  officials; and                                                                  3) A substudy of the primary research program that will entail                  content analyses of print and broadcast coverage of the Achille                 Lauro hijacking.",
