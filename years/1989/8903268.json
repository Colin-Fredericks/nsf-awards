 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous cross-cultural studies have suggested that cultural                    meaning systems play a role in the development of differing                     patterns of attachment behavior.  However, no research has been                 conducted directly assessing the impact of cultural meaning                     systems on parents perceptions of attachment behavior.  The                     present two-part study will compare lower- and middle-class Anglo               and Puerto Rican mothers'views of attachment behavior in                        toddlers.  The first study will examine mothers' indigenous                     concepts of desirable versus undesirable attachment behavior.                   Consistent with their individualistic cultural orientation, Anglo               mothers are more likely than Puerto Rican mothers to be concerned               with the development of autonomy and internal coping resources in               their children.  In contrast, reflecting their sociocentric                     orientation, Puerto Rican mothers are more likely than Anglo                    mothers to emphasize their children's development of qualities                  important in maintaining interpersonal harmony.   Based on                      mothers' responses, prototypes of attachment behavior considered                desirable and undesirable in each cultural group will be                        constructed.  The second study will compare mothers' perceptions                of the prototypical toddlers.  It is predicted that mothers will                rate the toddlers most extremely along these descriptors which                  are relevant to their culture.                                                                                                                                  This research will contribute to an understanding of the impact                 of sociocultural meaning systems on mothers' perceptions of                     attachment behavior.  We will learn whether mothers from                        different sociocultural backgrounds hold contrasting normative                  conceptions of childhood, and whether these conceptions lead them               to evaluate the same child behaviors differently.  Through this                 investigation, the sociocultural elements in models of normative                behavior will be made more apparent, and prevailing models of                   child development will be enriched.",
