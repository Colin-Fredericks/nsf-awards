 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the application of category                 theory to the semantics of programming languages. The principal                 investigator will examine algebraic semantics in the category                   PER, order-enriched sketches, enriched semantics, initial                       algebras and some computer related research.                                         The research in this project involves the application of                   category theory to problems in theoretical computer science.                    Traditionally, category theory has dealt with the foundations                   of algebra; namely, it has focused on sets with algebraic                       structure, mappings between sets that preserve that structure,                  and even more abstract functors that relate the collections of                  algebraic structures and their mappings. In recent years, this                  research subject has enjoyed a rebirth in theoretical computer                  science. In this project, the techniques of category theory                     will be applied to study the semantics of programming                           languages, data types, and categorical programming.",
