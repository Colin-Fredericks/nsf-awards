 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, part of the experimental Physical Chemistry                      Program, applies picosecond and femtosecond time resolved                       spectroscopic techniques to the study of solvation dynamics,                    electron transfer reactions, vibrational and orientational                      relaxation, and diffusion controlled reactions. These studies                   will elucidate how the interactions between dissolved molecules                 and their surroundings influence molecular relaxation and                       reactivity.                                                                                                                                                     The pathways of vibrational relaxation of medium-sized                          molecules in a variety of solvents will be investigated by                      taking advantage of improvements in tunability, sensitivity and                 time resolution of laser systems. The extent of inhomogeneous                   broadening in vibrational lineshapes will be examined by using                  a Raman echo technique in which a pair of pulses excite a                       coherent superposition of vibrational states. Such a system                     evolves until a second pulse pair rephases the vibrations.                      After a second delay the phase coherence is probed by Stokes                    scattering induced by a third laser pulse. The origin of                        nonexponential decays in charge transfer reactions will be                      studied. In particular, the role of a non-equilibrium initial                   state in strongly adiabatic electron transfer reactions will be                 explored.",
