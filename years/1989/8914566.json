 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radio noise generated by \"incidental\" transmitters such as light                switches, computers, radio and television receivers, and by non-                licensed low power radio devices, e.g. cordless telephones,                     garage door openers, etc. create serious interference problems                  for other users of the radio spectrum.  Knowledge of the noise                  level generated by incidental and non-licensed radiators is                     important, for example for the planning of interference reduction               strategies, the design and siting of radio observatories and                    other communication systems as well. Measurements of the noise                  level generated by different communities are almost non-existent,               however.  The P.I has proposed to obtain such measurements from                 aircraft, within the 30 to 600 MHz frequency range,                             approximately.  The present proposal is for a one year extension                of the work proposed last year.                                                                                                                                 The extension will enable the P.I. to study seasonal and cyclical               variations of the noise level, identify some of the main                        contributors to the noise, and determine if aggregate effects can               be predicted from the knowledge of individual sources.",
