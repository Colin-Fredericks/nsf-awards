 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under oxidative conditions, the hydroxyl radical is probably the                dominant species responsible for initiation of the decomposition of             organic molecules in high temperature combustion environments.                  Laboratory flow reactor and full scale emissions data have shown that           chlorinated methanes and ethanes are among the prevalent high                   temperature by-products from the thermal oxidation of chlorinated               hydrocarbons (CHCs).  It is therefore proposed to measure the high              temperature reaction rates of OH radicals with chloro-methanes and -            ethanes using a laser photolysis/laser-induced fluorescence technique           in conjunction with a specially fabricated high temperature,                    atmospheric pressure quartz test cell.  In the absence of thermal               decomposition, precise rate constant measurements may be obtained up            to 1373 K.  The rate data will be used to validate or modify currently          available calculation techniques for the transition state theory of             bimolecular reaction rates.                                                                                                                                     The growing use of incinerators to dispose of toxic organic wastes has          generated an interest in the combustion of CHCs, which appear to be             kinetically controlled.  Successful modelling of the process requires           knowledge of the high temperature oxidation mechanism.  The proposed            research will supply some of the key data for OH/CHC reactions at               temperatures above 480 K, where data                                            are presently unavailable.",
