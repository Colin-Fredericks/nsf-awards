 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will focus on problems of nonlinear partial                      differential equations.  Emphasis will be placed on elliptic                    equations in which the ratio of the forcing term to the second                  variable are subject to certain restrictions. There are different               degrees of resonance and methods for solving such equations                     depend on this degree.  Relatively little attention has been                    given to the case of strong resonance in which the integral of                  the forcing term remains bounded.  Work will concentrate on                     equations governed by this condition.  A topological approach to                the existence problem will be used.  The (now) classical mountain               pass lemma of Ambrosetti and Rabinowitz does not apply to this                  setting (the Palais-Smale condition cannot be verified).  An                    alternate approach is now proposed which may bypass earlier                     difficulties by imposing boundary conditions which will lead to                 some form of generalized pseudogradient mappings.  The critical                 points of these mappings will then represent solutions of the                   equations.    //",
