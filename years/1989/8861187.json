 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant and soil health can be improved through the inoculation                   of plant roots with beneficial bacterial.  In particular,                       bacterial inoculants that control fungal diseases of plant                      roots have proven successful under restricted conditions.                       However, the potential of this approach has yet to be                           realized in the filed.   One reason is that individual                          bacterial products are limited in their range of                                applicability due their lack of ability to establish high                       populations in the rhizosphere of different crops under                         different environment conditions.                                                                                                                               The goal of this proposal is to isolate genes that would                        improve the competence of fluorescent pseudomonads to                           establish themselves in the rhizosphere of different crop                       plants.  The approach proposed is first to assemble a well-                     characterized collection of fluorescent pseudomonads that are                   amenable to molecular genetic manipulation, and then to                         determine whether their rhizosphere competence is host-                         specific for three different crop plants.  Success is in this                   approach will pave the way for the development of root-                         colonizing pseudomonads as microbial pesticides for soil-                       borne fungal pathogens, and provide a viable alternative to                     the use of chemicals for the control of many plant diseases.",
