 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed research are to (1) determine               the relative importance of competition and facilitation as                      mechanisms influencing primary succession in a nutrient-                        impoverished environment, (2) dissect these mechanisms into their               component biological processes, and (3) compare experimental,                   observational, and historical (retrospective) approaches to the                 study of succession.  The research will be conducted at Glacier                 Bay, \"the\" classical example of facilitation.  Although most                    experimental work has shown facilitation to be unimportant in                   terrestrial ecosystems, this work has been largely restricted to                secondary succession where soils are well developed, whereas the                concept of facilitation originated mainly from observations in                  primary succession, where plants confront a more severe                         environment.  The central hypothesis to be tested is that life                  history traits explain the basic pattern of succession, but that                the rate of succession is influenced by both facilitative and                   competitive interactions among species.  Life history traits to                 be measured in the field are seed rain, growth rate, age of first               reproduction, and longevity.  Possible inhibitory effects of                    established vegetation upon seed germination and initial                        establishment will be tested by sowing spruce and alder seeds                   into each of four successional stages (uncolonized, Dryas, alder,               and spruce) in presence and absence of forest floor.  Competitive               or facilitative effects of established vegetation upon seedling                 growth will be tested by planting alder and spruce seedlings into               each successional stage.  The record of past competition and                    facilitation will be derived from studies of tree cores and stand               age structure.",
