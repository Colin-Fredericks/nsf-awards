 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a one year internship in parallel computing                 for a faculty member from a minority institution.  The objective                is to give the participant the opportunity to master techniques                 and to conduct research in parallel computing.  Working closely                 with computer scientists who are experts in parallel computing,                 the participant will learn about various debugging tools and                    performance measurement techniques available for parallel                       programs, study languages used to program multiprocessors, and                  work on the design of algorithms to exploit parallelism.  The                   participant will then be encouraged to review the wide range of                 applications being carried out on multiprocessors, and to propose               and work on his own new applications.  Finally, the participant                 will have hands-on experience with a variety of different                       advanced-computer architectures.                                                                                                                                The proposed internship will provide an excellent opportunity for               a faculty member to acquire knowledge and experience in the area                of parallel computing.  The current internship program has                      attracted highly qualified faculty members who wish to keep                     abreast of new technologies.  We are confident that the proposed                program will be equally successful.",
