 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computerized video microscope system will be used to digitize, store          and reconstruct complete microvascular networks in the cerebral cortex          of the rat in vitro.  A mathematical model of cerebral                          microcirculation based on the reconstructed course, branching pattern           and diameter of the vessels and a model of apparent blood viscosity             will be developed.  The model will be used for a computer simulation            of vascular growth and adaptation to mechanical strain and changing             blood flow representing growth of or injury to brain tissue and/or a            change in local tissue metabolism.                                                                                                                              The cerebral microcirculation plays a critical role in the maintenance          of an optimum internal environment for neuronal function.  The                  response and adaptation of microvascular architecture and blood flow            to mechanical and biochemical stimuli from normal or injured nervous            tissue is, however, poorly understood.  A computer simulation of                cerebral microvascular growth based on real vascular architecture and           geometry is developed to study possible mechanical/hemodynamic                  determinants of microvascular reorganization.  Until now, the                   measurement and modeling of the essentially 3-dimensional                       cerebrovascular architecture has been essentially impossible.  Using            novel methods of computerized video microscopy, the true 3-dimensional          Topological and geometrical organization of complete microvascular              networks of the brain cortex can be determined for the first time.              This allows the engineering analysis of distribution of blood flow in           the reconstructed microvascular system and, in turn, the computer               simulation of the adaptive growth of vascular tissue in response to             mechanical and functional stimuli.",
