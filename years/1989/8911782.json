 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication between cells in the nervous system is mediated                   chemically by neurotransmitters, which are released from                        presynaptic nerves and interact with specific receptors on                      postsynaptic cells.  The chemical acetylcholine mediates                        neurotransmission in the peripheral and central nervous systems,                interacting with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, notably at                  neuromuscular junctions, in autonomic ganglia, and in certain                   areas of the brain.  The function of the nicotinic acetylcholine                receptor is to bind acetylcholine and transduce this binding into               a depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane via the rapid                     opening of an ion channel.  Receptor activation can be modulated                physiologically and pharmacologically by a number of mechanisms.                Acetylcholine itself modulates receptor activation homotropically               via various desensitization processes, and other transmitters can               modulate receptor function heterotropically either by interacting               directly with the receptor or through intracellular second                      messenger systems.  This research project will investigate the                  molecular mechanisms of these modulatory processes and the                      interactions between them.  The neuropeptide substance P appears                to heterotropically modulate nicotinic receptor activation by                   interacting with an allosteric binding site on the receptor.                    Available evidence suggests that modulation plays a physiological               role in the regulation of catecholamine release from the adrenal                gland.  Although these experiments focus on the mechanism of                    action of substance P and its effect on agonist-induced                         desensitization, heterotropic modulation by receptor-coupled                    second messenger systems will also be investigated.  These                      mechanisms will be studied in various model nicotinic receptor                  systems including cell lines and purified receptor-enriched                     membranes, representing both muscle- and neuronal-type nicotinic                receptors.  Nicotinic receptor responses will be studied over a                 broad time scale, using both biochemical and biophysical                        techniques.  Elucidation of the mechanisms of these modulatory                  processes will contribute to the understanding of the                           physiological and pharmacological regulation of the activity of                 this important receptor.",
