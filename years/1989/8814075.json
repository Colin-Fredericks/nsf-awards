The development                includes both theoretical and computational investigation of                    decomposition techniques which allow division of the problem into more          tractable subproblems.  Of particular interest are models of large              systems in which congestion or other nonlinearities are important.              The methodology being investigated is applicable to many models that            arise in operations research such as transportation planning, routing           and scheduling, manufacturing, and logistics.  It is also applicable            to models of electrical and physical systems developed in other                 engineering disciplines and in the sciences.",
