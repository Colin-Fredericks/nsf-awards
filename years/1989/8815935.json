 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Donald L. Court and co-workers at Bionetics          Research Inc. - Basic Research Program, Frederick Cancer Research               Facility, Frederick, MD to collaborate with Prof. Yoshikazu Nakamura            and his group at the University of Tokyo, Japan, over a period of two           years.  They will join in a project aimed at determining how the rnc            and era genes encode RNaseIII and Era, which are involved in the life           cycle of the E. coli bacteria.  Specifically, these researchers will            determine the function of the era gene product; determine the                   structural and functional organization of the rnc-era operon;                   determine the various controls exerted on rnc-era operon expression;            and determine the biochemical and genetic interactions that these               proteins may have with other proteins.                                                                                                                          The purpose of this research is to apply a unified approach using both          physiological genetics and biochemistry to analyze the interaction              between these two genes, which are of importance in cell growth.                These genes are known to separately encode products in E. coli, and             therefore there is the possibility of a relationship between them, a            possibility which will be investigated in this project.  The                    collaboration between the U.S. investigator, known for his work in              bacterial and phage genetics, and the Japanese investigator, a                  respected molecular geneticist, should lead to an increase in the               fundamental knowledge base, particularly of how proteins are modulated          and how they modulate other systems.",
