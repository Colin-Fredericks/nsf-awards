 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a joint seminar on urban traffic networks,              organized by Professor Nathan Gartner, University of Lowell and                 Professor Gennaro Improta, University of Naples, Italy.  The                    problems of urban traffic in the industrially developed countries               have been growing in severity for a long time.   While both an                  indicator of and contributor to the economic well-being of those                countries, highway traffic also has well-known detrimental effects,             evident in high rates of congestion, accidents, and pollution.  In              the past few years, there were particularly rapid advances in two               areas that affect urban traffic:  l) Modeling of traffic flows in               urban networks and calculation of predicted equilibrium conditions;             and 2)  Technology for communication with the driver and the                    ability to guide him to his desired destination.  U.S. scientists               have made tremendous advances in the modeling and calculation of                equilibrium flows in urban traffic networks.  Yet existing models               lack the capability to deal effectively with the impact of new                  control and communications technologies on traffic flows.  It is                the goal of this seminar to contribute to the closure of this                   apparent gap.                                                                                                                                                   The combination of the capabilities of the scientists from the two              countries, with the possible participation of observers from other              countries as well, may lead to improved methodologies that combine              technological developments and new computational capabilities for               the improvement of traffic control and traffic analysis in urban                areas.  The Italian side has embarked on a program code-named                   PROMETHEUS (Program for European Traffic with Highest Efficiency                and Unprecedented Safety) to utilize advances in information                    technologies and to increase safety and reduce adverse                          environmental impact.  The lack of such a comprehensive and                     far-reaching program in the U.S., increases the potential for                   mutual benefits from this workshop.",
