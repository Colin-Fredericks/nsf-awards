 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed at the re-structuring of an undergraduate              course sequence in electronics.  The objective of this work is to               integrate modern computer-based data acquisition and analysis                   techniques into both laboratory and lecture components.  The audience           for this three quarter sequence is drawn from physics majors, students          majoring in other sciences or mathematics, as well as students                  preparing to teach physical sciences at the high school level.  The             goal is to introduce into the laboratory portion of the course current          generation computers, data acquisition hardware, and integrated                 software to acquaint students with modern techniques of data                    collection, analysis and display.  This will employ personal-computer-          based workstations and software with extensive acquisition and analysis         features.  The lecture portion of the course will undergo                       modifications to reflect the increased presence of computer-based data          analysis in laboratory environments.  As a result, it is expected that          the students will be better prepared to pursue their objectives after           graduation, whether in industrial employment, graduate school or                teaching.  The college will match the award with an equal amount of             funds.",
