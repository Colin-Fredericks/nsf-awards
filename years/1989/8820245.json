 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is a renewal of a grant by The National Science               Foundation to Professor S. M. Bedair, North Carolina State                      University, to investigate the potential of laser enhanced                      metallorganic vapor deposition to selectively deposit epitaxial                 films of compound semiconductors on gallium silicon substrates.                 The previous award by the Foundation to Professor Bedair was a                  Special Creativity Award.  During the previous grant several                    significant accomplishments were made, e.g., establishment of the               experimental conditions for selective epitaxy and direct writing                of single crystals of gallium arsenide, aluminum gallium                        arsenide, gallium arsenic phosphide, and indium gallium arsenide                on gallium arsenide and silicon substrates, growth of compound                  semiconductors by laser-enhanced chemical vapor deposition at the               lowest reported temperatures (250oC), and growth of superlattices               using chemical vapor deposition without gas switching. The                      research during this continuation period will emphasize the                     following:  thermal processing during laser-enhanced chemical                   deposition, study of effects of thermal stress on the quality of                the films, study of gas dynamics during growth, study of doping                 behavior and electrical properties of the films, and low                        temperature deposition, direct laser writing during deposition.                                                                                                      The research is relevant to maskless writing and growth of                 optoelectronic devices, and advanced epitaxial growth of                        integrated optical and electronic materials.  Optoelectronic                    materials will impact communications and optical processing                     devices which are important to the economic competitiveness of                  the United States.  Students are receiving excellent training                   under the grant for careers in research on these vital materials.",
