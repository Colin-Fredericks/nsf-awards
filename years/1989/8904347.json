 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paleokarst horizons along the topes of 2 Proterozoic                       carbonate units will be mapped, sampled, and isotopically                       investigated in order to obtain quantitative climatic                           temperatures and to further investigate the possibility of                      biological activity on the Precambrian land surface.  The                       paleokarst horizons occur along unconformities and represent                    weathering that occurred well inland and long after the original                deposition, silicification, and dolomitization of early,                        metastable carbonate phases.  New generations of chert and                      carbonate precipitated during the weathering, solution, and                     alteration of the carbonate; a major goal is to clearly                         distinguish and separate these secondary phases which formed                    under terrestrial conditions from the earlier phases which formed               under marine or coastal conditions.                                                  The secondary cherts that formed from meteoric waters should               be strongly depleted in 18O and D relative to the earlier phases                and should define an isotopic array parallel to the meteoric                    water line that contrasts strongly with data for the earlier                    cherts.  This relationship, which has already been approximately                established for one locality, will allow greatly refined surface                temperatures to be established for one key time interval in the                 Proterozoic.                                                                         Previous carbon isotope analyses of weathered carbonates of                this age have suggested that the land surface already was                       populated by photosynthesizing organisms.  Carbon isotope                       evidence for organic activity on the Precambrian land surface                   will be further evaluated at a new and better locality which                    appears to have even larger and more convincing carbon isotopic                 variations.",
