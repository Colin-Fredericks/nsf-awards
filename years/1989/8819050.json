The                  amphibian, Xenopus, is a unique organism for studying the                       evolution and development of the vertebrate immune response.                    Several groups, investigating the Xenopus system at the molecular               level, have identified elements of both B-cell differentiation                  and expression of major histocompatibility molecules which seem                 to be unique to this species.  Other workers, investigating the                 ontogeny of both stem cells and the thymus, are collecting data                 which are unattainable from higher vertebrates.  The goal of this               conference, therefore, is to focus on these emerging areas of                   Xenopus developmental immunobiology and to identify both                        similarities and differences between frogs and more well studied                birds and mammals.                                                                   This conference will catalyze productive interactions and                  draw attention to the unique and interesting aspects of this                    important amphibian species as a source of new insights into the                fundamental mechanisms of self recognition and self defense that                underly immune responses.",
