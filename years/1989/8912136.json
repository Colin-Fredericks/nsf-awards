Included within those responsibilities are the              following tasks which will be performed for the NSF by ORNL:                    1)  Preparation of Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact               Statement for the U.S. Antarctic Program.  This comprehensive                   supplemental EIS will update and make current the programmatic EIS              published in 1980.                                                              2)  Preparation of Environmental Assessments or other appropriate               environmental reviews when necessary.  If it is determined from the             assessment that an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary that             work will also be done by ORNL.                                                 3)  Preparation of annual U.S. Antarctic Program pollution control              compliance plan reports for inclusion in NSF pollution control                  compliance plans as described by Executive Order 12088.  These reports          will be drafted and revised in consultation with NSF.                           The initial amount of $300,000 provides funds to begin all three tasks          in Fiscal Year 1989, but is reduced from the requested level to account         for the limited time remaining before the end of the fiscal year.",
