The students will be entering 8th through 12th grade students                   from 29 school districts in Michigan which have been identified                 to have large minority populations.                                                                                                                             Classes will be formed with three levels of sophistication                      grouping the 8th and 9th, the 10th and 11th, and the 12th graders               in the three levels.  Each level will be taught by a team of                    three instructors who represent mathematics, computer science,                  and written and spoken communication.  The classes will be taught               in an informal mode with a special emphasis on mathematical                     problem solving using computer technology where appropriate.                                                                                                    Follow up conferences will be held both on the campus and in the                districts during the following school year to provide continuing                support for the participating students and the other students and               teachers in the district.",
