 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department of Dickinson teaches its introductory physics            courses in a workshop setting.  Instead of attending lectures, Workshop         Physics students learn physics by using direct observations and the             computer as a primary tool for data collection, data analysis, and              numerical problem solution.  The Equipment provided by the grant allows         students to explore two-dimensional motion by videotaping, digitizing,          and analyzing sequenced events using existing Macintosh SE computer             systems.  Software, a Workstation, Macintosh SE computer enhancements,          and LAN equipment are used to allow introductory physics students to            use a symbolic computer language such as Mathematics on a regular               basis.  This allows students to relate the results of experiments to            more abstract and general behavior of functions derivable from theory.          As a result of this laboratory improvement program, the Workshop                Physics Activity Guides currently under development for dissemination           to other colleges and universities are being enhanced to include                activities made possible with more versatile equipment and software.                                                                                            The college is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
