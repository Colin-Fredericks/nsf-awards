 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, composite columns have been used to achieve                    greater efficiency in many major structures in the United States.               Simultaneously, the technology of high strength concrete has                    advanced rapidly and several important structures have been                     constructed using high strength concrete.  The advantages of high               strength concrete and composite construction can be combined to                 achieve even further efficiency, particularly in the columns.                   The combinations is composite columns with high strength                        concrete.  In these columns, the concrete will provide extra and                stability in compression and the steel will supply strength,                    stiffness as well as ductility. The objectives of the research                  are to study behavior and to develop guidelines for design of                   composite columns with high strength concrete.   The objectives                 will be met by conducting experiments and analyses on a series of               columns have configurations representative of those occurring in                practice.  A total of sixteen specimens will be tested.  The                    specimens will have W shapes encased in the high strength                       concrete.  Using the test results and analytical correlations of                the results, current design procedures for composite columns will               be modified or new procedures will be formulated.",
