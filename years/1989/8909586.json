 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the problem of VLSI circuit layout in the case          where wire widths are in the sub-micron range and transistor density is         beyond one million per chip.  Design problems here are computationally          intractable.  The P.I. is studying both computational and algorithmic           aspects of solution methods, and devising tools that can harness the            enormous complexity of the design problems.  Research topics are: (1)           development of fast algorithms for floorplan designs with rectilinear           modules; (2) channel routing techniques for designs with rectilinear            cells; (3) via minimization methods based on criteria of manufacturing          cost and complexity, and circuit performance and reliability; (4) new           algorithms for multi-layer topological channel routing; (5) automation          of leaf cell generation; and (6) new approaches to parallel simulated           annealing applicable to solving these design problems.                          This research investigates the problem of automating IC layout in the           case where wire widths are in the sub-micron range and transistor               density is beyond one million per chip.  The P.I. has novel ideas,              which show promise in solving the automation problem.  The principal            investigator is a promising and competent young professor who should            make significant contributions to the field.",
