 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Young Scholars Instrumentation Institute is a three-week                    summer program together with year-long follow-up activities                     designed to provide high quality science enrichment and career                  awareness for 20 students entering 11th grade from the                          Washington, DC metropolitan area.  The main institute components,               focusing on chemistry and physics, will be introduction to                      instrumental techniques, a research project utilizing these                     techniques, and career planning activities.                                                                                                                     Young Scholars will gain hands-on experience with IR, NMR,                      UV-visible spectophotometers, refractometer and gas                             chromatographies.  Field trips to Litton-Amecom, NIH and the                    county policy laboratory will give students an opportunity to                   observe the increasing sophistication of modern                                 instrumentation--from routine laboratory instrumentation to the                 highly sophisticated FTIR, mass-gas chromatograph interface, high               resolution NMR and a one-of-a-kind microplasma detector.  The                   institute, field trips and follow-up activities will expose Young               Scholars to the breadth and wealth of science careers.                                                                                                          Prince George's Community College's excellent science faculty and               laboratories have lead to the development of special science                    projects targeted to different populations.  These programs,                    enthusiastically endured by participants, county science                        supervisors, and the Maryland State Department of Education,                    answer the nationally and locally recognized need for upgrading                 content knowledge, generating interest and excitement in science                topics and introducing science career opportunities.",
