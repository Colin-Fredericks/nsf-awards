 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Finger Lakes of Central New York State have long been                       considered one of the world's great testimonies to continental                  glaciation.  During Phase I of this research project we were able               to, for the first time, document the extent of bedrock erosion                  beneath the lakes as well as the nature of the sediment fill via                seismic reflection profiling.  We discovered that the lake                      valleys have been eroded to as much as 304 m below sea level and                contain an unusually thick (up to 275 m) and apparently complete                sediment record ( < 14 Ka) of Laurentide ice sheet deglaciation                 and post-glacial history.  The purpose of this proposal is to                   request continuing support for a deep-lake drillcore.  In                       addition to calibrating our seismic stratigraphic framework, the                primary scientific objectives include:  (1) establishment of a                  high-resolution paleoclimatic record for the past 14 Ka; (2)                    provide in situ \"ground truth\" for various models of Laurentide                 ice sheet deglaciation; and, (3) test various hypotheses for the                origin and evolution of the Finger Lakes.  Our approach to                      sediment analysis will be both comprehensive and                                multidisciplinary involving lithostratigraphy,                                  chronostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, physical properties and                    chemostratigraphy.  On a global basis, the scientific value of                  long drillcores form large lakes has just recently been realized                and the proposed Finger Lake drillcore will add to a growing                    global database on lacustrine sequences.",
