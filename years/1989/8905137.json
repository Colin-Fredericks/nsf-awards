 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of Dr. Meinke's research is to identify genes with                  essential functions during plant embryo development. The                        approach is to isolate and characterize embryo-lethal mutants of                Arabidopsis thaliana. He here proposes to 1) continue the                       analysis of embryonic lethals with interesting patterns of                      abnormal development; 2) attempt to identify genes with important               developmental rather than housekeeping functions; and 3) develop                strategies for the molecular isolation of mutant genes. Several                 different models have been proposed to facilitate the                           identification of genes with important developmental functions.                 He plans to test these models by isolating additional mutants                   with unusual patterns of development, defects in genes expressed                only during embryogenesis, lethal phases that correspond to a                   critical stage in morphogenesis, and arrested embryos that are                  green rather than white. Three different approaches to molecular                analysis of embryonic lethals will be pursued in collaboration                  with other laboratories; 1) gene tagging with T-DNA following                   seed transformation; 2) gene tagging with maize transposable                    elements; and 3) chromosome walking and molecular complementation               through transformation. He proposes to focus his attention on                   three mutants with particularly interesting phenotypes; the                     biotin auxotroph (bio1); a fused cotyledon/rootless mutant                      (emb30); and a green blimp mutant with no apical meristems                      (emb22). Additional mutants will be mapped in preparation for                   gene isolation through chromosome walking.                                      %%%                                                                             Developmental mutants have been used in a variety of animal                     systems to identify genes with important developmental functions.               This proposal extends that approach to the genetically                          approachable plant, Arabidopsis.",
