 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biosynthesis of beta-(1,3) linked glucans and possibly                      cellulose in higher plants is catalyzed by the plasma membrane                  enzyme glucan synthase (UDP-glucose:(1,3)-beta-glucan synthase).                To understand the biochemical basis for the regulation of cell                  wall polysaccharide biogenesis and wound healing, it is necessary               to identify and characterize the polysaccharide synthases.                      Glucan synthase is ubiquitous in plant tissue but has proven to                 be a stubborn enzyme to purify to homogeneity by standard protein               fractionation techniques.  It is now possible to obtain                         stabilized and highly-enriched enzyme preparations from a range                 of plant sources using differential solubilization with the                     detergent CHAPS, gel filtration chromatography and product                      entrapment.  This research will resolve the longstanding question               of whether beta-(1,3) and beta-(1,4) linked glucans are                         biosynthesized by one enzyme or by several where each is distinct               for the formation of one linkage type.  Furthermore, unambiguous                identification of the polypeptides which comprise the glucan                    synthase complex will facilitate identification and cloning of                  the gene or genes which code for important enzymes in plant cell                wall biogenesis.                                                                                                                                                Cellulose, an immensely abundant biopolymer, serves a structural                role in plant cells.  Its biosynthesis is only incompletely                     understood because of the difficulties in isolating the enzymes                 involved from cell walls.  This project focuses on the major                    regulated enzyme and will provide important information on how                  cell walls are made and kept intact.",
