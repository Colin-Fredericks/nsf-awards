 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to analyze the developmental                  regulation of mitochondrial ATP synthase biosynthesis and                       function in the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei during its               differentiation from mammalian to insect (tsetse fly) host                      specificity.  This differention is accompanied by mitochondrial                 biogenesis, derepression of the mitochondrial genome, and a swith               from glycolytic to respiratory energy metabolism; and is                        advocated as a model system for mitochondrial biogenesis in                     eukaryotes.  The subunit structure of the enzyme, and its                       regulation by inhibitor or activator proteins, will be examined                 in different developmental forms of the trypanosome.  These                     experiments will be accompanied by cloning and structural                       analysis of enzyme genes and gene transcripts, and a test of the                possibility that editing of these transcripts occurs in some                    developmental stages.  It is intended that the combined result of               these studies will reveal the molecular basis and regulatory                    mechanism of the developmental shift in ATP synthase activity                   that occurs in this system.  In addition, this research has                     potential to contribute generally to knowledge of regulation of                 polysubunit enzymes in differentiating systems.",
