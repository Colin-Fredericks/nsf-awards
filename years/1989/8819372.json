 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will look at how impressions of others are formed.                An analysis of any particular social event, be it juror decision                making, attraction and liking, attitude formation, or                           stereotyping processes, involves the dynamics of person                         perception.  This process of moving from observable behaviors to                inferences about someone's underlying personality has important                 implications for nearly every aspect of the social world.  This                 research looks in detail at this process of constructing                        impressions, at the storage of impressions in memory for use at a               later point in time,and at the retrieval of these impressions for               making subsequent judgments about the person.  In earlier work,                 the researcher has found that the ability of a group of judges to               agree on their impression of a target depends on the trait                      dimension considered, on the information available, and on                      differences among the judges in the frequency with which various                trait dimensions are routinely used in describing others.  In                   particular, judging how extroverted or sociable someone is turns                out to be much easier than a judgment of intelligence,                          responsibleness, or honesty.  This research will investigate                    whether this difference remains when more narrow definitions of                 the traits are provided (e.g., intelligence in a given context),                when the acquaintance takes place over a longer period of time,                 when the outcome judgment has some important consequences for                   both judge and target (e.g., admission to graduate school), and                 if the task is to disconfirm an existing impression rather than                 to form a new one.  In addition, differences in the ease of                     judging these traits are related to theories of how we make                     attributions for the causes of others' behavior.  Finally, a                    series of studies will explore the representation of impressions                in memory. Specifically, these studies look at how closely tied                 are memories for the actual behaviors performed by someone to                   inferences based on these acts about the person's underlying                    personality.  To the extent that inferences are not \"bound\" to                  the evidence on which they are based, errors in perception are                  difficult to correct, and change in impressions is unlikely to                  occur.//",
