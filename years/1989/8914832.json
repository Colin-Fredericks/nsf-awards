 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lack of success to date in preservation of mammalian organs   in a          frozen state is attributable to the disruption of the   structural              integrity of blood vessels caused by vasculature   expansion during             freezing, such that the organ becomes non-  functional.  As an organ            is being frozen, ice first forms in the  blood vessels, excluding               solutes into the yet unfrozen   intravascular water from nearby cells,          resulting in the expansion of the vasculature.  To modify this                  detrimental freezing pattern, a novel method is proposed to freeze in           the presence of special   antifreeze glycopeptides from the blood of            Antarctic fish.  The   glycopeptides entrap excluded solutes within             channels in the ice  structures, and thus reduce or prevent efflux of           intracellular   water.  Freezing experiments will be done on a                  directional   solidification stage, and tissue histology will be                examined using a low termperature scanning electron microscope.                                                                                                 The long term preservation of whole organs would significantly alter            transplant procedures and increase the availability of vital organs             for needy patients.  If the proposed hypothesis is confirmed, the               possibility of preserving whole livers by freezing will be greatly              enhanced.",
