 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objectives of the proposed research are to continue                   basic investigations into the mechanism of phagocytosis using                   Amoeba proteus as a model cell system, and in the context of an                 undergraduate institution, to expose undergraduate students to a                realistic research experience.  Phagocytosis is a fundamental                   cellular process which involves the uptake of particulate                       material through surface membrane infolding and vesiculaton.  In                the initial three years of NSF support for this project it was                  demonstrated that chemotactic peptides can induce phagocytosis in               the amoeba.  A more detailed analysis of this process is now                    proposed.  Stimulation of phagocytosis involves calcium movements               and possibly components of the arachidonic acid cascade, perhaps                in a signal coupling role.  The events associated with signal                   coupling during phagocytosis will now be analyzed.  Initial                     association of the signal with the cell surface will be measured                by following the binding of tritiated peptides to the amoeba                    surface.  In order to establish the mechanisms by which surface                 information is transmitted to the cell interior, the role of G                  proteins, diacylglycerol, inositol trisphosphate, calcium, and                  arachidonic acid metabolites in signal transmission will be                     investigated.                                                                                                                                                   The amoeba is a particularly useful model system for the study of               endocytosis, and the results of this study should increase our                  insight into the mechanism of phagocytosis in this and other                    cells.  This study will also contribute to basic understanding of               cellular signal transduction mechanisms in general.",
