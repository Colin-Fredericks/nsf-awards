 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to isolate and characterize a                protein in plant stem cell membranes that is involved in the transport          and action of the plant growth regulator, auxin.  Auxin is synthesized          in the growing tips of plants and is transported through stem cells             rather than being carried by a circulatory system.  It is transported           through these cells in a unidirectional fashion, from the apex to the           base.  This transport is required for auxin stimulation of the                  elongation of these cells.  Naphthylphthalamic Acid (NPA), an                   herbicide, binds specifically to a protein in cell membranes,                   inhibiting auxin transport. This NPA-binding protein, which is located          largely on the lower ends of stem cell membranes, is thought to be              involved in unidirectional auxin transport. Establishing the structure          of this protein and understanding its role in auxin transport will aid          in understanding the mechanism of this transport process and in                 understanding the auxin-controlled coordinated growth and development           of plants.                                                                                                                                                      This proposal will use a radioactive analog of NPA, 5'-azido-NPA (Az-           NPA) to radioactively label the NPA-binding protein, purify the                 radioactively labeled protein, and determine the amino acid sequence of         the amino terminal portion of the isolated protein.",
