 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematical research project of Professors Larson and                 Smith concerns algebras of operators on Hilbert space and also on               more general Banach spaces. Part of this work will focus on                     operator algebras that come from lattices of subspaces or                       projections, in particular on the question of when two such are                 conjugate by an invertible transformation. The property of                      relexivity for such algebras will also be studied. The latter                   consideration makes contact with single operator theory.                        Structural properties of operator algebras and of maps between                  them will be investigated. Of especial interest here are notions                like complete boundedness that relate to tensoring with matrix                  algebras of arbitrarily high dimension.                                              The operators that lie at the heart of this project may be                 thought of as a species of enriched numbers. They obey the same                 laws of arithmetic as numbers with two notable exceptions, namely               that the result of multiplication depends on the order in which                 the factors are taken, and not every nonzero operator has an                    inverse. Mathematical analysis knows only two number systems, the               real and complex, but there is an immense variety of operator                   algebras. Situations unsuitable for numerical representation can                often be represented in some fashion by operator algebras, thanks               to the greater degree of flexibility available with the latter.                 The price for this is that understanding the structure and                      classification of operator algebras requires considerable effort,               as for instance the work to be undertaken in this project.",
