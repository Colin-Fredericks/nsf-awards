 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ever increasing demand on power processing systems for improved             efficiency and reliability, smaller size and weight, coupled with               continuous growth in dimension and complexity of payloads, has focused          attention on a major deficiency - the ability to design, test and               trouble-shoot large-scale power systems.  One of the major                      difficulties in large-scale system analysis involves the subsystem              interaction problems.  As a system becomes more complex, the                    interactions among highly nonlinear components and subsystems create a          large degree of uncertainty in the system response even though each             component may be well understood and documented.  Thus, the need of a           comprehensive power system modeling tool that can actually predict a            system's local and global behaviors is most critical since the                  elaborate design verification through integrated systems hardware               testing is prohibitively expensive or often impossible.                                                                                                         The main objective of the research in this phase is to develop a                computer-aided comprehensive large-scale power processing system                modeling tool using the multi-port coupling method to facilitate the            design and analysis of present and future power processing systems,             particularly in the area of satellite and space power systems, main             frame computers, and communication power systems.  Components of power          processing systems are inherently nonlinear.  As a result, their                behaviors, due to large-signal and small-signal disturbances, can be            quite different. Employing the comprehensive modeling tool, dc,                 small-signal and large-signal dynamics will be analyzed for both local          component level and global system level.  The interaction analysis              will be performed to aid the system level design and trouble-shoot.",
