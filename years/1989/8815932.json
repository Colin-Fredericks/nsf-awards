 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. R. David Dallmeyer of the University of            Georgia to collaborate with Dr. Akira Takasu of Shimane University,             Japan, over a period of two years. They will investigate the                    geochronology of a particular geological formation on the Japanese              islands of Shikoku and Honshu, using a radioactive argon isotope                dating method to verify and calibrate time-pressure evolutionary                histories of the area.                                                                                                                                          The purpose of this research is to enhance our understanding of the             thermal and high-pressure phenomena which led to the current status             of the geological structure that is known as the Sambagawa terrane in           the Japanese islands.  Understanding the precise timing, regional               distribution, and overprinting relationships of the metamorphic                 structural events that have contributed to the formation of this                terrane would enable geologists to completely assess the thermal                effects associated with the various Japanese orogenic cycles, with              resulting increase in understanding not only of important Japanese              geological events, but of such events anywhere.  The U.S. researcher            is an expert in the argon dating techniques to be employed, and his             Japanese collaborator performed the original survey of the geological           history of the Sambagawa terrane.",
