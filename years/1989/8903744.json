 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction between light and the plasma membrane of growing                leaf cells is the focus of this proposal. Leaf expansion requires               light. Most dicotyledonous leaves remain very small in the dark,                expand slightly in response to (red) light of low fluence rates,                but they require continuous exposure to (white) light of high                   fluence rates to reach full size. this photoresponse is a \"high-                irradiance\" response of phytochrome occurring in green tissue,                  and it may involve additional activity of a blue-light receptor.                The mechanism(s) transducing light absorption to cell growth will               be pursued by testing the following hypotheses: 1) red and blue                 light act through two photoreceptors to stimulate cell growth in                leaves, 2) blue light stimulates proton efflux driven by an                     electron transport system in the plasma membrane, 3) red light                  acts through phytochrome to modulate potassium flux through ion                 channels. These possibilities will be tested in primary leaves of               Phaseolus vulgaris L. which provide a well documented model                     system for light stimulated cell expansion. The generality of                   their responses will be tested in leaves of other species                       (Populus, Vicia, Impatiens) which grow differently in response to               light.                                                                          %%%                                                                             The goal of the research is to determine how leaf cell                          enlargement in plants is controlled and what is the nature of the               molecules involved in their growth response to light.",
