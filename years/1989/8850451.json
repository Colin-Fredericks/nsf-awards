 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of the project is to develop a three-year inservice               program for middle school teachers in the Philadelphia area which               integrates several academic subjects in the school setting. There are           intensive courses offered for three consecutive summers to 46 middle            school teachers (each year) to increase their in-depth knowledge of             science and mathematics. There is a series of academic year seminars for        the participants to reinforce and continue the goal of inquiry-based            learning. There is a leadership component which draws on the experiences        of participants from previous projects to work with new participants.           The program also includes workshops, during the third year, in which the        participants learn to be part of a cadre of Teacher-Consultants for             science and mathematics in their school and District. The participants          learn to work with researchers applying cognitive science to                    applications in an urban setting. The staff's intent is to promote              institutional change among colleges and universities which insure that          inservice teachers benefit from the results of programs such as this            one. The staff is developing indicators for assessing effective science         instruction. The results of the project are to be disseminated through          national publications, conferences on educational reform, assessment,           and teacher networking. There is a very active consortium of agencies           involved in the host institution and this is reflected in the multi-            layered participation in the project as well as cost sharing the project        activities. The cost sharing amount is $449,766, which is                       $449,766/$698,274, or over 65% of the funds requested from National             Science Foundation.",
