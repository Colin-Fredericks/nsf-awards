 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal for research on \"Sequence Specific Incorporation of               Functionalized Bases into RNA\" between Dr. Christopher Y. Switzer and           Professor Steven A. Benner of the Eidgenoessische Technische                    Hochschule, Zurich, Switzerland, is sponsored by NSF.                                                                                                           Ribonucleotides are involved in cell division, genetic regulation,              viral growth, and tumor transformation.  The recent discovery of                catalytic RNA and its ability to serve as an RNA polymerase has                 resurrected early ideas that the first biological catalysts were                RNA molecules.  There is little information regarding the confor-               mation of these molecules in solution.  The investigation of RNA                tertiary and quaternary structure in such activities as RNA                     splicing, tRNA maturation, and translation has been limited by the              lack of flexibility available with existing RNA synthesis tech-                 nologies.  Unnatural bases containing structural probes (photo-                 affinity labels, spin-labels), if incorporated at specific sites,               would facilitate advances in these areas.  A nucleotide base pair               distinct from those of A/T(U) and G/C that is incorporated into RNA             by a polymerase could allow such sequence-specific introduction of              structural probes.                                                                                                                                              The goal of the proposed work is to synthesize the iso-cytidine bases           carrying functional groups at the 5-position, and to incorporate them           enzymatically into RNA under the direction of a DNA template                    containing d-iso-G.  The iso-C/iso-G base pair has a Watson-Crick               hydrogen bonding pattern different from the A/T(U) and G/C base                 pairs.  Because of this different hydrogen bonding pattern, a RNA               polymerase should faithfully incorporate the iso-C derivatives                  opposite only to d-iso-G.  These functionalized bases will assist               in experiments to probe RNA tertiary and quaternary structure.",
