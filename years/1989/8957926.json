 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary task proposed is to develop the theory and technology to            realize miniaturized, efficient power magnetic components for use in            advanced low-voltage (1.5 - 5 Volts) microelectronic power supplies,            which will be distributed as board-level \"components\" having very high          efficiency (95%) and very high power density (100 Watts per cubic               inch).  The technology is essential because conventional methods to             fabricate power transformers and inductors prove inadequate to realize          miniaturized, high-performance components reproducibly and cost-                effectively.  To be developed are alternate magnetic configurations,            electrical and mechanical models that are useful at circuit and system          levels and for simulation, fabrication techniques, and design                   methodology with yield emphasis.                                                                                                                                Also proposed is the development of a Simulator for Power Electronics           Circuits and Systems, a much-needed CAD tool in power electronic                engineering.  Basic features to be realized are behavioral and                  hierarchical modeling, event-driven scheduling, variable and multiple           time steps, and efficient numerical algorithms for switched-mode                networks.  Models for power electronic components, functional blocks,           and converter topologies are also included.                                                                                                                     Curriculum and laboratories will be established to produce students             capable of pursuing a career or performing research in power                    electronics.",
