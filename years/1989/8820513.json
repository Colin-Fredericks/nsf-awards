 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonductile reinforced concrete moment-resisting frames                          constructed twenty or more years ago have been indentified as                   one of the most pressing problems associated with mitigating                    hazards in the existing building inventory.  During the past six                years a variety of repair and strengthening techniques for                      reinforced concrete frames have been investigated and includes                  addition of structural walls, jacketing or enlarging columns                    and/or beams, and addition of steel bracing.                                                                                                                    This research program extends previous work conducted at the                    University of Texas.  This program consists of frame tests as                   well as tests on critical details of strengthening procedures for               nonductile moment-resisting frames.  The project is divided into                two major tasks:  (1) Problems associated with addition of                      structural walls to nonductile frames, including improvement of                 column splice performance, study of interface flaws at top of                   wall, interface shear transfer tests (influence of axial load and               dowels), and frame tests with infill walls; and (2) Addition of                 steel bracing systems to reinforced concrete frames including                   detailing of connections for continuity, systems with braces                    having high slenderness ratios, and systems with braces having                  low slenderness ratios.                                                                                                                                         This is a collaborative research project between the University                 of Texas at Austin and H. J. Degenkolb Associates.  This                        research project represents the participation by H. J. Degenkolb                Associates.",
