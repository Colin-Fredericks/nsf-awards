 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is data showing that electric and electrochemical ion                     currents in test objects can be imaged using a novel magnetic                   scanning and acoustic detection approach.  This appears to be a                 new imaging technique which generates information concerning                    the electrical nature of the object not presently obtainable                    with other imaging approaches.  It may be useful in diverse                     disciplines ranging from biology and electrochemistry, to                       electronic circuit testing.  It would appear to be particularly                 useful in the noninvasive visualization of bioelectric currents                 flowing in living organisms.                                                    This research will focus on constructing and testing the                        charactersitics of a prototype imaging system similar n some                    respects to a scanning electron microscope.  Instead of a                       scanning electron beam, a mechanically scanning 1 kHz magnetic                  field causes the generation of electrical Lorentz force                         vibrations in the object.  Acoustic emissions from the sample                   are monitored with a piezoelectric detector and their intensity                 is used to create an image on a computer display.  The research                 will attempt to use the system to noninvasively measure                         bioelectric current flows in small living obects in a new way                   which may give greater insight into functional physiologic                      processes.",
