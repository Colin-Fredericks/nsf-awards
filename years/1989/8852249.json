 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds from this award will provide the advanced undergraduate                   student in nutritional sciences with a combined research                        methods/research project experience.  Presently, the number of                  students that can enroll in \"independent research\" is severely                  restricted due to limited available faculty time.  This award                   will create a course structure that will permit up to 12 students               to simultaneously participate in a complete research experience.                This will be accomplished by incorporating the theory and                       applications of a variety of nutrition research methods and                     techniques into the investigation of relevant nutritional                       biochemistry topics.  The purchase of a ultracentrifuge, and                    fluorescence spectrometer, in combination with existing                         Department equipment and resources, will be used to 1) expand the               students' understanding and appreciation of the use of basic                    instrumentation in research, 2) expose students, that have                      already completed biochemistry lab course, to more advanced                     research techniques and concepts, 3) provide the Department with                the necessary equipment to permit undergraduates to complete an                 advanced research project in a formal course setting, and                       ultimately 4) improve student interest in, and qualifications                   for, research careers and graduate schools.  The grantee                        institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non-                     Federal sources.",
