The focus is on charac-                   terization of clay minerals, for which the high resolution                      techniques permit direct structural, chemical and textural                      characterization.  Comparison of characterized samples that cover               the range of a given process permit mechanisms of transitions to                be defined.  This research emphasizes the parallel effects of                   changing temperature, water/rock ratio and stress in promoting                  reactions in metastable phases, for which transitions are in                    predictable Ostwald-step-rule-like changes toward the equilibrium               state generally reached at greenschist facies conditions.                       Specific projects include:  (1) Gulf Coast argillaceous                         sediments, with emphasis on illite/smectite relations (2) quanti-               tative studies of the causes of variation in illite crystallinity               (3) diagenesis through biotite-grade metamorphism, with emphasis                on processes causing textural changes in southern New Zealand                   rocks, principally greywackes (4) low grade metamorphism with                   contact metamorphic overprint in Welsh pelites (5) alteration of                marine basalts, emphasizing trioctahedral clay minerals in DSDP                 core 540B.  Such studies lead to a better understanding of                      diagenesis in clay-rich rocks which will have important                         implications to oil and gas exploration.",
