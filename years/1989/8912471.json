 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout the developing world, governments have instituted large         irrigation projects and new land policies in hopes of increasing food           production.  Although this goal often has been achieved, a consequence          of these policies has been a disruption of traditional land-tenure              practices and a degradation in the quality of the land itself.  This            doctoral dissertation research project will analyze the processes of            tenure-system change and land degradation in the Senegal River Valley           of Damga province in northern Senegal.  Patterns of tenure change and           land degradation will be documented and analyzed using a variety of             data sources, including published and archival records, field                   observations, soil tests, geneological studies, aerial photographs,             interviews, and oral histories.  Qualitative analyses of physical               conditions and of historical and cultural attributes will permit                refinement and testing of a model that focuses on how individuals and           groups relate to and make decisions about land and related natural              resources.                                                                           This research will provide a well-constructed and thoroughly               documented case study of how persons engaged in cultivation and                 pastoral activities respond to changes in land-tenure systems.  This            case study will enhance theoretical understandings about this topic,            and it will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising graduate           student to expand and refine her basic research skills.",
