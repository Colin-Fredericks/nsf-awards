The research is based largely on the recent infinite                    combinatorial characterization of summands of simply presented                  groups and the further exploitation of separability,                            equivalence theorems and valuated structure on quotient groups.                 These new developments provide a unified point of view for a                    broad assault on a variety of problems that cut across the                      traditional divisions in the theory of abelian groups.                               This project is concerned with the classification of                       infinite abelian groups. The structure of finite abelian groups                 has been well understood for over a century. Infinite abelian                   groups, however, have remained elusive. This investigator will                  attack this problem from a new point of view.",
