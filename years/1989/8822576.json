 "awd_abstract_narration": "Members of the genus Araceae include morphologically and                   ecologically diverse tropical plants.  In some genera, shoot                    development is altered allowing the plant to climb toward the                   forest canopy.  Dr. Thomas Ray proposes to use state-of-the-art                 approaches to studying shoot and leaf development in various                    genera of aroids, in order to learn how different patterns of                   plant development have evolved.  A microcomputer-based image                    analysis system will be used to measure shape and size of leaves                and shoot organs, and these new data will be studied against the                framework of ancestor-descendant relationships.  The proposed                   research will reveal the evolutionary pathways that different                   developmental types have traversed.                                                  The proposed research has implications beyond the study of                 Araceae taxonomy and evolution.  Biologists are keenly interested               in how development is altered during evolution, and how                         development constrains the path that evolution may take.  Dr.                   Ray's work will also broaden the application of computer-aided                  research in botany, and will provide new computer software to the               community of evolutionary systematists.",
