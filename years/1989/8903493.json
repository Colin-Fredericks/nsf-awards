 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new mathematical model for fluid-rock interaction has been               developed that overcomes the problematic assumptions in                         calculations of fluid-rock ratios.  The new model permits                       determination of time-integrated fluxes (units of volume fluid                  per area rock) and direction of flow from petrologic,                           geochemical, and/or isotopic data on rock samples.  If duration                 of flow and fluid pressure gradients can be estimated, Darcy                    velocities, and in situ permeabilities may be computed.                              Proposed research will further develop the model and apply                 it to several significant problems in contact and regional                      metamorphism.  Results will provide the first systematic                        determination of fluxes, flow directions, and rock permeabilities               in a wide range of metamorphic environments.  Specific  projects                include:  (1) the amount, geometry, and geologic controls of                    fluid flow on the scale of an entire regional metamorphic terrane               (Waits River Formation, eastern Vermont); (b) the amounts and                   direction of fluid flow in a ductile shear zone and their                       relation to metasomatism (shear zones at Scourie, northwest                     Scotland); (c) the amount, geologic controls, and chemical                      effects of fluid flow at the top of a major granitic batholith                  (roof pendants in the Sierra Nevada); (d) the role of fluid flow                in anatexis (Onawa contact aureole, central Maine); (e) the                     amount and petrologic effect of fluid flow during very low-grade                regional metamorphism (Liassic black shales, central Swiss Alps);               and (f) the role of fluid flow in regional metasomatism                         (Vassalboro Formation, south-central Maine).",
