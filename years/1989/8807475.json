 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a prototype of a highly            interactive \"identification workbench\" in the domain of plant-                  parasitic nematode genera.  The system will be based on principles              central to both expert systems and to expert workstations.  There               are important interactive systems questions, as the group of users              is a diverse one, varying from novice to expert on domain knowledge,            as well as familiarity with modern computing environments.  Dealing             with this diverse group will be handled through the \"set of                     available tools\" paradiam from expert workstations. Graphical                   assistance will be available to the identifier, and the object-                 oriented environment of Smalltalk presents a powerful and fully                 integrated environment in which objects will help unify the system              model and the user's model of the identification process.  The                  problem area is challenging and appropriate from the point of view              of expert systems because nematode identification is highly                     problematic with weighty economic consequences, there are very few              expert taxonomists and poor geographic distribution of existing                 ones, there is large variability within taxa, several important                 factors introduce different kinds of uncertainty, and the overall               identification process is based on rules of thumb.  Efforts to                  codify the knowledge in the domain and assist with the development              of an underlying architecture are proceeding in parallel with this              project.  The concepts of protomorphs and nuclei will be fully                  developed and refined by a panel of about thirty of the                         approximately forty expert nematologist worldwide.  These experts               will also help characterize the identification process and evaluate             the finished prototype.",
