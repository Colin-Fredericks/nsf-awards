 "awd_abstract_narration": "Focusing on Appalachian salamanders (Desmognathus                          ochrophaeus and related species) whose biology is well                          characterized, the PI's: (1) developed and applied new                          experimental procedures for measuring sexual incompatibility, (2)               established that geographically isolated populations of                         ochrophaeus have evolved substantial incompatibility, (3) found                 that the magnitude of incompatibility is related to the                         geographic separation of populations but only weakly related to                 genetic differentiation, (4) identified the critical courtship                  stages which underlie incompatibility, and (5) found some                       evidence for stronger incompatibility in areas where related                    species occur together.  These results lay the groundwork for the               detailed studies of sexual and developmental incompatibility that               the PI's plan to pursue in this proposal.  First, the PI's plan                 to identify the behavioral mechanisms responsible for the sexual                incompatibility observed between geographically isolated                        populations of ochrophaeus.  Because there are very few                         observational studies of sexual incompatibility in vertebrates                  and other animals, the proposed behavioral studies will greatly                 increase understanding how such incompatibility evolves.  Second,               the PI's plan to survey developmental incompatibility among                     ochrophaeus populations.  This survey will enable the                           investigations to determine whether sexual and developmental                    incompatibility evolve in parallel, an issue that has never been                resolved in vertebrates.  Third, the PI's plan to take a                        statistical approach to the question of whether sexual                          incompatibility is enhanced in areas where related species occur                together.  Such enhancement has been the centerpiece in textbook                discussions of the evolution of reproductive incompatibility, yet               empirical support for the process is mixed.  The PI's plan to                   test for enhanced sexual incompatibility in several transects                   through areas of co- existence, and to identify the behavioral                  basis of enhanced sexual incompatibility.",
