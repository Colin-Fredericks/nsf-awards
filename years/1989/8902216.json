 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basis for this work is the strong connections which                    exist between geometric and harmonic analysis.  The latter                      subject concerns the decomposition of mathematical functions                    into simpler pieces and the reconstruction (synthesis) of                       functions from these pieces.  Often the pieces arise                            naturally as eigenfunctions of differential operators such as                   the Laplace operator defined on a surface or manifold.                          However, eigenfunctions of operators occur in many contexts                     where the ideas of harmonic analysis are just beginning to                      penetrate.  The object of this research is to foster further                    development in this direction.                                                       A simply-connected Lie nilpotent group of step 3 or                        higher has a sub-elliptic Laplacian representable as the sum                    of the squares of the generators.  Work will be done in                         determining the eigenfunctions of this operator.  For step 2                    groups such as the Heisenberg group, the eigenfunctions are                     described in terms of Hermite functions.  The present work                      should lead to new classes of special functions.                                     Other work will study sets of fractional Hausdorff                         dimension.  These sets which have long played a role in                         harmonic analysis are now coming into prominence in many                        areas of mathematics.  One goal of this project will be to                      examine more closely recently discovered inequalities between                   the mean-square integral of Fourier transforms and the same                     integral of the originating function taken with respect to                      alpha-dimensional measure.  In particular, work will                            concentrate on determining what fractal properties of the                       support of such a measure can be obtained by considering the                    asymptotic behavior of Fourier transforms of functions                          multiplied against the measure.                                                      A new line of investigation will take up the now                           classical theory of almost periodic functions developed early                   in the century by Besicovitch.  One of the drawbacks to the                     theory was the fact that when a norm was defined for the                        space of such functions, it produced a large null space.                        This work will look for new ways of producing metrics on the                    space, developing a distributional point of view and deriving                   a useful theory of generalized harmonic analysis on the                         space, with special emphasis placed on the expansion of the                     Fourier transform.",
