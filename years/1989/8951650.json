 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alma College will purchase new equipment to upgrade its optics                  laboratory and enhance the teaching of optics.  The new equipment will          be used to (1) provide laboratory experience and undergraduate research         opportunities for students enrolled in an upper level optics course,            (2) enhance optics teaching in other courses, and (3) support the               College's science teacher training and recruitment program.                                                                                                     The equipment includes an optical table with vibration-isolating legs,          an optical bench, a He-Ne laser, 3 spatial filters, 3 precision                 mirrors, a laser spectrometer, and a laser power meter.  These items,           along with equipment already on hand or to be purchased by the College,         will equip the laboratory for experiments in electro optics, coherent           imaging, spatial filtering, Fourier optics, and holography.                                                                                                     Specific experiments in an upper level optics course will illustrate            the concepts of coherent optics while preparing the students to work            independently in undergraduate optics research.  The newly equipped             laboratory will also serve students studying optics in introductory             physics, physical science, and astronomy courses, and it will support           cooperative summer research experiences for secondary science teachers          and selected high school students.                                                                                                                              The college will match the award with an equal amount of funds.",
