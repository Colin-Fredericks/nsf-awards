 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project extends a test program currently in progress to                    include the repair and retesting of welded steel moment                         connections which have been subjected to large cyclic loads.                    In this manner, current techniques for repairing steel moment                   frames which have experienced strong earthquake ground                          motion can be critically evaluated.  The current series of tests                is investigating the behavior of large scale beam to welded box                 column connection.  They are being conducted in concert with                    the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) and the                     Structural Engineers Association of Southern California                         (SEAOSC).                                                                                                                                                       This investigation will help, among other things, to evaluate                   current field repair procedure and the behavior of the assembly                 in the repaired condition.",
