 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bryozoans are a widespread and important group of colonial                 invertebrates.  They have a long evolutionary history and inhabit               nearly all types of aquatic environments.  Graduate student                     Michael Temkin proposes a study of the reproductive biology of                  roughly twenty species of bryozoans, in order to establish their                modes of fertilization and development.  Temkin proposes to                     establish whether fertilization and the activation of development               are internal or external to the coelomic cavity.  The project                   will use flourescence microscopy and a DNA-specific stain on                    representatives of 12 families from five suborders.  These                      results will improve our understanding of the evolutionary                      relationships among different bryozoan groups, as well as the                   relationship of bryozoans to other lophophorate phyla (phoronids                and brachiopods).                                                                    Little is currently known of the reproductive biology of the               bryozoans, and the proposed research will take an important first               step towards establishing the value of a new class of data.  The                results of this project may open a new and valuable tool for                    unravelling bryozoan evolution.",
