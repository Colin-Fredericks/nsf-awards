 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical atmospheric chemistry models used to predict                   the effects of human activities on stratospheric ozone are                      dependent on measurement of reactive chemical species in the                    upper atmosphere.  The radical OH is an important chemically                    active transient species that is believed to control the                        concentration of ozone above 40 km, and to have a strong                        influence on the partitioning of odd-nitrogen and odd-chlorine                  species that affect the main ozone level at about 25 km                         altitude.  A relatively inexpensive method of gaining                           information about fluctuations in OH levels is provided by                      ground-based observations of the column abundance of OH by the                  PEPSIOS (Poly Etalcon Pressure Scanned Interferometric                          Spectrometer) system.                                                                Under previous NSF grants the principal investigator has                   carried on a successful program of PEPSIOS measurements at the                  Fritz Peak Observatory in Colorado Since 1977, and more                         recently for Boca Raton, Florida, the Poker Flat Research Range                 near Fairbanks, Alaska, and at Truk Island in Micronesia.  This                 research is being done by a scientist who is generally                          recognized as a pioneer in this area of atmospheric chemistry                   research.  His research papers on the spatial and temporal                      variations in the stratospheric hydroxyl radical concentrations                 are widely acclaimed and have provided important information                                                                                                    about several aspects of the chemistry of the stratosphere and                                                                                                  mesosphere.  This continuation research will include continued                                                                                                  studies of the middle atmosphere hydroxyl radical in the                                                                                                        tropics as well as the measurement of this species from the                                                                                                     Fritz Peak Observatory.",
