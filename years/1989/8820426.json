 "awd_abstract_narration": "A subject of intense current interest in astronomy is mass loss                 from stars.  Mass loss occurs during virtually all phases of                    stellar evolution, though the rate of mass loss varies                          considerably.  One of the more enigmatic phases of mass loss                    occurs during the red giant phase of stars that have masses                     similar to that of the sun.  These stars may shed up to 10-3                    solar masses per year and thereby produce planetary nebulae                     (which are circumstellar gaseous shells that expand at speeds of                a few km/sec).                                                                                                                                                  The mass loss regions surrounding some of the most luminous red                 giants are characterized by strong hydroxyl maser emission.  The                Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to investigate theoretically               and observationally such regions.  The objective of the research                is to understand better the mass shedding process; to describe in               greater detail the geometric, dynamic, thermodynamic, and                       magnetic structure of the mass loss regions; and to determine the               collective influence of this mass loss on the chemical evolution                of the galaxy.",
