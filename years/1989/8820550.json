 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the ovary of the domestic hen, as in other females of reproductive           age including humans, there are many thousand immature eggs or oocytes.         Only a relatively small portion of these eggs will grow and mature.             The hormonal mechanism responsible for an orderly development of                ovarian follicles containing the oocyte is poorly understood. Evidence          gathered in the past decade or so indicates that under the influence of         a hormone (LH), a certain type of follicular cell(granulosa cell)               produces a steroid hormone (progesterone) that is essential for                 ovulation to occur.                                                                                                                                             This grant proposal deals with the cellular and molecular mechanism             underlying this important step in female reproductive physiology.               Various experimental approaches will be used to study the transduction          of LH.generated signal across the cell membrane of granulosa cells and          the subsequent biochemical reactions that may be involved in this               process. Specifically, the way in which these cells handle calcium              ions, believed to play key functional roles in many cellular processes          will be quantitated by up to date technical procedures.                                                                                                         Modern breeding, husbandry and nutrition have maximized the                     productivity of egg.laying chickens.  Any further improvement which may         reduce the number of non.laying days/year and thereby further increase          productivity is expected to come from new discoveries in reproductive           biology of this important meat and egg.producing domestic species.  In          addition, the information generated by this project regarding basic             physiological processes may be applicable to other species, there by            providing some new insights into ovarian physiology in general.",
