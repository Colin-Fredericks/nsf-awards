 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by twelve                     U.S. scientists in the Fifth International Workshop on the                      Physics of Semiconductor Devices, to be held in New Delhi,                      India, December 10-15, 1989.  The Indian organizers are                         Professor S. C. Jain, retired director of the Solid State                       Physics Laboratory in the Department of Defense, New Delhi,                     and Dr. S. Radhakrishna, of the Indian Institute of                             Technology, Madras.  The conference/workshop, as was the                        case in the earlier four workshops, will deal with itegrated                    circuits, VLSI, submicron technology, MOS, bipolar devices,                     solar cells, high power rectifiers, light emitting diodes                       and similar devices.  It will deal with developments in                         design, manufacture and use of such devices.  It is expected                    that approximately 300 persons will attend including about                      60 from foreign countries including Western Europe, the U.S.                    and Canada, Australia, Japan, the USSR and Eastern Europe,                      as well as scientists from developing countries in South and                    East Asia.                                                                                                                                                      Scope:  The PI has been the project director for the U.S.                       delegations to three of the past four conferences, and the                      Indian scientists, Dr. Jain has been the chairman of all the                    conferences.  These have resulted in proceedings covering                       the important papers presented at the meetings.  This                           workshop is likely to be quite successful and productive,                       and the proceedings should add to the scientific literature                     in this important area.  Increased cooperative research is                      very likely to result between the two countries in this                         important area.",
