 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project, this project will                   extend the atmospheric CO2 concentration and isotope composition                record back through Holocene times.  This would be done by                      measuring the concentration and C13/C12 ratio of carbon dioxide in              atmospheric gases trapped in relatively small (250 g) samples of                ice from Greenland ice cores.  The technique would be to place the              sample in a specially designed vacuum system and to sublime the                 ice onto the surface of a -80 c cold trap.  The gas will be                     released by this procedure.  The amount of CO2 sample so obtained               would be accurately measured and its C13/C12 ratio determined.                  The air in the sample would be recovered on molecular sieve.  The               amount of air, per unit of ice, would record the altitude of the                ice sheet at the time of seal-off.  The ratio of CO2 to air would               be accurately measured (to better than 0.5%) which would record                 the CO2 concentration of the sample of trapped atmosphere to                    better than 1ppm.  The C13/C12 ratio of atmospheric carbon dioxide              during glacial times will also be measured.  The change of this                 ratio during the glacial/post-glacial transition will be an                     important test of the proposed mechanisms for the large (80 ppm)                CO2 concentration change that occurred at that time.  Other                     climate-related questions include a detailed study of the end of                the last glacial and the glacial/post-glacial transition, the                   Younger Dryas event, and the Dansgaard-Oeschger events.  These                  concentration and stable isotope data, combined with radiocarbon                dates for CO2, will enable testing of carbon cycle models relating              to past and future climate change.",
