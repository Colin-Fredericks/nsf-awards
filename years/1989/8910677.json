 "awd_abstract_narration": "Important international meetings among social scientists provide                vital opportunities for enriching the research endeavors of all                 countries represented. More and more problems of basic and                      applied research have implications for the role of the United                   States in the world. At this point, dialogue between Western and                Eastern European and Russian sociologists is especially promising               for the development of collaborative efforts. This grant will                   provide partial support for a highly selected group of American                 sociologists playing significant roles in The Twelfth World                     Congress of Sociology, to be held in Madrid, Spain, July 9-13,                  1990. Held once every four years, the Congress is a function of                 the International Sociological Association and draws over 4,000                 sociologists, approximately 20% of whom are American. The                       recipient of these funds, the American Sociological Association,                will, through a special committee, conduct the competition for                  individual awards and distribute the travel grants to those who                 most merit them. To be eligible, sociologists need only have                    a paper accepted for presentation or have a significant role on                 the program. Among those eligible, the selection criteria to be                 employed include the intrinsic merit of the paper, the                          significance of the paper as an U.S. contribution within the                    program to which it is submitted, and the qualifications of the                 applicant. Attention will also be given to balance among                        participants of various ages, genders and racial/ethnic groups.",
