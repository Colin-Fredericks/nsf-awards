 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research under this award involves four important aspects                  of atmospheric motion.  Although some of the research involves                  general processes, the focus is primarily on the tropics.                            (1)  Using semi-geostrophic theory, the PI will calculate                  the large-scale atmospheric response to the passage of squall                   lines.  The task require the identification and use of                          specialized numerical methods.  Model results will be verified                  with data from a recent observational field program, Pre-STORM.                      (2)  The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a band of                  tropical convection and major source of heat release into the                   atmosphere, annually migrates from the Northern Hemisphere to                   the Southern Hemisphere and back roughly following the solar                    insolation maximum and is associated with a large-scale                         circulation pattern known as the Hadley cell.  There is a                       distinct asymmetry in the strength of the Hadley cell in the                    two hemispheres.  The PI will investigate how the position and                  intensity of the ITCZ, interacting with the large-scale                         atmospheric flow, affect the Hadley circulations.                                    (3)  Many studies of tropical cyclones are limited by the                  assumption of axisymmetry.  The PI is developing a new model                    for the study of tropical cyclones which will allow for                         asymmetric motion and will use it to study aspects of the                       observed banded                                                                 structure of hurricanes.  In addition, he is developing a general               tropical cyclone model that can be run on a personal computer.                  This should prove to be an excellent educational as well as                     research tool.                                                                       (4)  Theoretical work aimed at developing models which are                 valid for highly curved flow will also be continued.                                 The PI is an excellent theoretician and mathematician who                  continues to make important contributions to the field of                       tropical dynamics.  Much of the research will be done in                        collaboration with a colleague in the Mathematics Department.",
