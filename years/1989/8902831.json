 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several questions in the mathematical theory of capillarity                 and related geometrical problems will be addressed in this                      project. Much of the work is motivated by concrete problems                     encountered in space where gravity is not present to mask the                   effects of surface tension as occurs for many phenomena on the                  earth's surface. Some of the more immediate applications will be                to new procedures for precise measurement of contact angle (and                 by inference to the question of whether contact angle can be                    regarded as an intrinsic property of materials in the sense                     envisaged by Young, Laplace and Gauss).  Other important issues                 center on the question of when capillary surfaces can exist in                  cylindrical tubes of general section in the absence of gravity.                 There are known cases where tubes will not hold fluids, but                     readily accessible geometrical conditions on the cross sections                 which will predict this are not known.                                               Work will be done in describing boundary behavior in the                   singular cases of perpendicular and tangential contact angles and               on the formulation of general equilibrium conditions for liquid                 volumes resting on support surfaces.  Liquid drops can, in                      principle, achieve a continuum of non-congruent equilibrium                     surface configurations.  Efforts will be made to find general                   conditions ensuring uniqueness and stability for such surfaces.                      Capillary problems can be used as barriers in the study of                 geometrical properties of surfaces of prescribed mean curvature.                This approach has been exploited with considerable success in                   recent years.  The full potential of the method is far from                     realized; work will continue toward this end.   //",
