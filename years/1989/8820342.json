 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla secrete the catecholamine               hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine.  These cells are derived               during ebryonic development from the neural crest and are very                  similar to norepinephrine-secreting neurons in the sympathetic                  nervous system and the brain.  Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-               I) is a peptide hormone that is structurally similar to insulin                 but that probably acts to regulate cellular replication and                     differentiation.  IGF-I enhances catecholamine secretion from                   bovine chromaffin cells in culture.  The goal of this research is               to understand the mechanism by which IGF-I regulates                            catecholamine secretion and other chromaffin cell functions.                    Because calcium is known to be an important regulator of                        catecholamine secretion, the proposed research will focus on the                effects of IGF-I on calcium metabolism in chromaffin cells.  The                effects of IGF-I on the number and activity of calcium channels                 and on the concentration of intracellular calcium in chromaffin                 cells will be studied.  If IGF-I affects the function of calcium                channels in these cells, the channels that are regulated by IGF-I               will be identified and characterized.  The effects of IGF-I on                  other chromaffin cell functions, including catecholamine                        synthesis, cyclic AMP production, and phospholipid metabolism                   will be evaluated.  This research should provide important new                  information about the regulation of catecholamine secretion and                 about the actions of IGF-I in the nervous system.",
