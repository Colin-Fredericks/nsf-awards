 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation into the radiative properties of ice           crystals in the polar atmosphere, and an assessment how these crystals          affect radiative fluxes, local heating rates, and visibility.  Ice              crystals have not generally been considered important in the polar              atmosphere, primarily because attention was focussed on anthropogenic           pollutants, and few optical effects such as those associated with mid-          latitude cirrus clouds have been observed.  However in the antarctic            atmosphere, clear-sky ice crystal precipitation has consistently been           observed, and at interior stations can account for more than 80 percent         of the annual precipitation.  Optical effects, including some quite rare        ones, due to ice crystals are observed frequently at South Pole Station.                                                                                        The climatology of arctic ice crystal is much less certain.                     Observations of ice crystals in the arctic from both the surface and            from satellites is difficult, particularly during the polar night.  The         occurrence of ice crystals may be noted in the synoptic present weather         code, but more likely will not be noted at all.  Satellite observation          of ice crystals, particularly over a snow or ice surface, or in the             polar night, remains an unsolved problem.  Recently however this                question has become more prominent as evidence is accumulating that the         horizontal visibility in arctic haze events is significantly less than          would be expected from the scattering characteristics of the haze               particles alone, and a significant ice crystal concentrations seem to be        indicated.                                                                                                                                                      This project will develop a cloud microphysics parameterization scheme,         based on observations of ice crystals, chemistry, and meteorological            conditions to be made in March and April 1989.  The model output of the         radiative flux divergences and heating rates will be coupled to a               thermodynamic sea ice model which will in turn provide equilibrium sea          ice thickness values.  This will provide a unique and innovative look at        how ice crystals interact with the chemical, dynamical  and radiative           processes in the polar atmosphere.",
