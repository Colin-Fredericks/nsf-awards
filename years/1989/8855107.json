 "awd_abstract_narration": "The participants in the Horizons Program (HEP) at the University of             Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) will develop skills, identify resources        and gain insights into a variety of science, mathematics and engineering        careers.  HEP opportunities will provide participants with in-school as         well as out-of-school learning experiences that are predominately \"out          of the conventional classroom.\"                                                                                                                                 The goals of the Horizons Exploration Program will be achieved through          four themes that address biology, earth science, engineering,                   mathematics, physics, chemistry and information management.  Strong             components from these disciplines will be threaded throughout the               project.  Presenters will be highly competent in their fields and               believe that the targeted student population can learn the material to          be presented and benefit from the associated career exploration                 activities.  HEP will have a heavy emphasis on the applications of              science and mathematics in the careers examined, and participants will          be exposed to careers having varying educational and entry level                requirements.                                                                                                                                                   HEP participants will come from the Baltimore City Public Schools.  HEP         will involve 15 male and 15 female students who have completed eighth           grade and are entering their first year of high school.  Acceptance is          dependent upon interest and aptitude in science and mathematics, an             academic average of above 80, evidence of financial need and potential          for success.  Particular attention has been made to include parents of          participants at appropriate junctures during both the summer and school         year agendas.  HEP participants will reside in UMBC dormitory rooms             during the summer component of the project.  During the school year the         HEP participants will continue to explore career options, develop               science process skills and conduct science investigations in a variety          of settings and science disciplines.",
