 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant part of the chemical industry has recently                        started to concentrate on the manufacturing of specialized                      high value added products.  At the same time, there is an                       increasing trend towards building smaller distributed flexible                                                                                                  processes that are located closer to the markets of                             consumption.  With the increased competition and market                         diversification that is being experienced in the chemical                       industry, there is a need for improving the planning for                        allocating limited capital resources for investment and for                     improving the scheduling in the manufacture of chemicals.  The                                                                                                  major concerns include not only reduction of investment and of                                                                                                  production costs, but also providing improved service to                        customers by delivering the required products on time.  Over                    the last few years a substantial research effort has been                       devoted to various aspects of planning and scheduling in batch                                                                                                  processes.  While planning and scheduling plays a central role                                                                                                  in batch processes, the same is often true of many continuous                                                                                                   processes that involve the manufacture of a variety of                          products.  In these processes uninterrupted operation takes                     place with possible change of feedstock or raw material and                     readjustment of operating conditions for each product.                          Inventories and transitions from one product to another are                     major issues.  Important industrial applications of continuous                                                                                                  processes that produce multiple products include processes for                                                                                                  manufacturing various types of polymers (e.g. polyesthers),                     chemicals (e.g. ketones), and finished products (e.g. paper).                                                                                                   In contrast to the area of batch processes, much less research                                                                                                  work has been done for scheduling and planning of these                         multiproduct continuous plants.                                                                                                                                 The objective of this research is to address a number of major                                                                                                  subproblems that arise in the scheduling and planning of                        multiproduct continuous plants.  Specifically the following                     items will be considered:                                                            1.  Development of models and solution techniques for the                                                                                                           scheduling of multiproduct continuous processes                                                                                                                 consisting of one or several parallel production                                                                                                                lines.  The extension of these models and techniques                                                                                                            for more complex plant configurations will also be                                                                                                              considered, as well as their use for design studies.                                                                                                        2.  Development of models and solution techniques of                                                                                                                multiperiod planning and design problems for process                                                                                                            networks consisting of single product and                                                                                                                       multiproduct continuous plants.                                             3.  Development of a strategy for the integration of                                                                                                                planning and scheduling in continuous multiproduct                                                                                                              plants.                                                                A major goal in this work will be to develop new systematic                     techniques to overcome major computational challenges that                      arise in the modelling and solution of these problems.",
