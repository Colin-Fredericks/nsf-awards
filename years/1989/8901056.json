 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most plants and animals reproduce sexually.  Therefore,                    understanding the causes and consequences of mate choice will                   increase our general understanding of nature.  White-throated                   sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) offer a rare opportunity to                   study the interaction of mate choice, natural selection, and a                  population's genetic diversity.  White-throated sparrows of both                sexes occur in two distinct forms, white-striped and tan-striped.               White-striped birds carry a normal and an \"inverted\" second                     chromosome; tan-striped birds have two copies of the normal                     chromosome.  tan-striped males are more aggressive than tan-                    striped, and so may mate more often.                                                 Most individuals pair with the opposite form during the                    breeding season; over 90 percent of territorial pairs are                       composed of one white and one tan individual.  The project asks                 how natural selection has influenced these preferences.  Matings                between two white-striped birds can produce offspring with two                  \"inverted\" second chromosomes; this is probably lethal to the                   offspring.  Matings between two tan-striped individuals cannot                  produce any white-striped offspring, and so lose the potential                  reproductive advantage obtained through white-striped sons.                     Essentially, one copy of the \"inverted\" chromosome is apparently                beneficial, but two copies is lethal.  Given this hypothesis,                   selection should favor mating with the opposite form.  Hence                    genetic, morphological and behavioral diversity in this species                 my be maintained as a consequence of selection on mate choice.",
