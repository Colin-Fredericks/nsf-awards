 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project involves a series of computer simulations using           molecular dynamics to study the properties of charged covalent                  clusters containing up to several tens of atoms.  Dr. Blaisten-Barojas          will add the best pair potential for the charged dimers Si +2, Ge +2            to the Stillinger-Weber potential, to incorporate polarization                  effects, and to study the equilibrium geometries, fragmentation                 pattern, equation of state, and coordination number as a function of            temperature.  The results should provide insight into the evolution             of cluster properties towards bulk properties.  Parallel to the study           of semiconductor clusters, she will undertake a study of doubly                 charged negative clusters and provide a model that could account for            the experimentally observed enhancement of the magnetic coercivity and          conductivity of iron particles implanted in insulators.                                                                                                         Interactive activities include organizing a symposium on the Physics            and Chemistry of Clusters, and a mini-symposium between the graduate            students of the Physics and Chemistry Departments.  In addition,                Dr. Blaisten-Barojas will teach a graduate course during the spring             and fall semesters.  She will also coordinate a series of talks to be           given by the female graduate students in the local high schools.                                                                                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
