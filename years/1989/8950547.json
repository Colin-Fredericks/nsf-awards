 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is the construction of an                      inexpensive but powerful parallel computing environment that will               allow the physics department of Mansfield University to introduce               advanced topics in physics to undergraduate students in a special               course using large scale simulations of physical systems.  The                  students will be able to perform computer experiments on                        realistic models and will be introduced to the basics of                        computational physics using a parallel machine.  In particular                  the computer system proposed will have the following                            characteristics:  (1) High computing power at a very modest cost,               that will allow them to simulate realistic physical models.  (2)                A true parallel environment with extensive use of parallel                      languages and hardware.  (3) The possibility of expansion by                    adding extra processing units to the system, and a flexible                     parallel geometry that allows easy modifications.  The equipment                consists of a small network of transputers controlled by an                     inexpensive PC-type host computer.  It will allow students in a                 course in computational physics not only to deal with serious                   problems in several areas of physics but to gain familiarity with               some of the parallel computational techniques and to do                         experiments in a true laboratory for computational physics.                                                                                                          The university will match the award with an equal amount of                funds.",
