 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in atomic physics                between Dr. Thomas Morgan, Wesleyan University and Dr. Francois                 Wuilleumier, Laboratoire de Spectroscopie Atomique et Ionique,                  Orsay, France.  The investigators propose a series of experiments               for the study of the photoionization of laser-excited atoms and the             photoionization of singly and doubly-charged atoms.  Information on             the properties of ions, their structure and interactions with                   atoms, other ions and radiation, is important for the plasma and                astrophysical sciences.                                                                                                                                         In this project, synchrotron radiation in conjunction with laser                excited ions will be used to probe the structure of atomic systems              and the dynamics of the interactions of photons with excited atoms              and charged particles.  Dr. Morgan will have access to the                      SUPER-ACO, the world's first third generation synchrotron radiation             facility, which is just being commissioned in France.  Dr.                      Wuilleumier, the French investigator, is a pioneer in the use of                synchrotron radiation in atomic physics; his Orsay lab is                       internationally recognized.  Results of this research will be of                value for the understanding of the structure and dynamics of                    excited atoms and ions in the free state.",
