 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in K-Theory and Algebraic                 Geometry of Professor Henri Gillet of the University of Illinois                at Chicago. In continuing joint work with C. Soule, he plans to                 investigate the relationship between algebraic and differential-                geometric invariants of arithmetic varieties, and possibly to                   apply these results to questions in number theory. Another                      project of Dr. Gillet is to continue joint work with Dr. Peter                  Shalen in studying the actions of groups on generalized trees,                  with the idea of using these actions to obtain information about                the cohomology of the groups involved.                                               This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and               Topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical Computer Science and in Robotics.",
