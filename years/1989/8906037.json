It will be interfaced with the                  control hierarchy of the robots, conveyors, sensors, programmable               controllers, and the control computer of the working Flexible                   Manufacturing Systems (FMS) in the laboratory.  The workstation                 will provide users with adequate computing capacity in terms of                 memory, mass storage, speed, networking and connectivity,                       software support, and a multiuser, multitasking environment.                         The workstation will be used to address research issues in                 Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP), Petri Net Theory and                    their use in manufacturing systems control, the design,                         development, and implementation of Artificial Intelligence based                Expert Systems in manufacturing systems, local area networks in                 manufacturing, etc.  It will be also used in the laboratory to                  develop and implement CAPP systems, Group Technology coding                     systems, vision systems, devise robot application programs, and                 to research and develop specific application programs for the                   working FMS.",
