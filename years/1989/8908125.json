 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project in mathematical physics is concerned                 with several problems about the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of               multi-particle Hamiltonians, particularly those associated with                 atomic and molecular systems. One topic is the instability of                   highly charged molecular ions. Another area of interest concerns                problems related to the estimation of physically significant                    energy differences, such as binding energies and ionization                     potentials. Some of the problems in this category are closely                   related to the behavior of eigenfunctions, particularly                         comparisons of eigenfunctions for different energy levels.                      Therefore it is also proposed to investigate the relationship                   between expectation values in states of different energies for                  such quantities as the interelectronic distance. Finally, a new                 approach to solving a long-standing problem in density functional               theory is presented.                                                                 The general idea here is the use of sophisticated                          mathematics to model the often counterintuitive behavior of                     microscopic physical systems. At this level, one needs to                       represent physical quantities not by numbers, which would be the                commonsense approach, but rather by functions and by operators on               spaces of functions. At the heart of such a representation is an                operator called the Hamiltonian, which has to do with energy.                   There is a quite simple abstract relationship between the                       Hamiltonian and the time evolution of the system. To exploit this               relationship is not so simple in practice, however; the hard part               is the calculation of eigenvalues (possible energy levels) and                  eigenfunctions (corresponding states) for whatever Hamiltonian                  one is working with. A distinctive feature of Professor Ruskai's                project is its focus on Hamiltonians that come from systems in                  which a not uncontrollably large number of particles interact                   with one another.",
