 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general area of mathematical research encompassed by                   this project relates to the theory of several complex variables                 and partial differential equations.  Some of the work will                      involve real variable microlocal techniques, other parts will                   focus on mappings between domains in spaces of several complex                  variables of different dimensions.                                                   One question of particular concern is that of unique                       continuation in Cauchy-Riemann manifolds.  Effectively these                    studies involve questions of whether or not a holomorphic                       function of several variables can be constant along various                     submanifolds of a domain, such as along a curve, and not be                     constant everywhere.                                                                 A second thrust of this work will focus on properties of                   sets preserved under holomorphic mappings between domains in                    spaces of possibly different dimensions.  Much of what is                       intuitive, and not surprising in one dimension, turns out to be                 false in higher.  Mappings whose Jacobians have determinant one                 everywhere may map unbounded domains onto bounded ones.  Some                   sequences are equivalent under automorphisms of complex space,                  others are not.  Difficulty in visualizing the true state of                    affairs makes progress slow in this area.                                            Fundamental to the analysis of first-order differential                    operators defined on domains is the determination of when the                   inhomogeneous d-bar equation can be solved for closed                           one-forms.  There is considerable evidence to suggest that the                  answer lies in the geometric concept of polynomial convexity of                 the complementary set.  If this can be shown to be the case, it                 will provide a major tool in establishing deep connections                      between the differential operators and the shape of domains in                  complex space.",
