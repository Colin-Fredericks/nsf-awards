 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Drs. Theodore D. Fuller                  and John N. Edwards, Department of Sociology, Virginia                          Polytechnic Institute and State University, to pursue with Dr.                  Santhat Sermsri, Department of Social Sciences, and Dr. Sairudee                Vorakitphokatorn, Institute for Population and Social Research,                 Mahidol University, Thailand, for a period of 12 months, a                      program of cooperative research on crowding, family relations,                  and health.  The primary objective of the project is to                         determine whether, in the Thai context, high levels of household                crowding have detrimental consequences for family relations and                 health and, if so, to investigate whether there is a \"tipping                   point,\" or threshold beyond which crowding effects become                       greatly pronounced.                                                                                                                                             Research on mammals, such as various types of rats and deer, has                shown crowding to be associated with a variety of deleterious                   consequences for the overcrowded animals.  In sociological                      theory, crowding has been thought to be associated with adverse                 social consequences.  Bangkok, Thailand, is a highly appropriate                site in which to conduct this research because of the extreme                   rates of crowding found in some Thai communities.  The present                  project will enhance cooperative research under NSF Grant No.                   SES 8618157 by providing funds for the two Thai Co-PI's to visit                the USA to collaborate with their US counterparts on the                        analysis phase of their research.  This project is relevant to                  the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program                   which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S.                   scientists and engineers and their counterparts in developing                   countries through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of                 mutual benefit.",
