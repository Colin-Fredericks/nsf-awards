 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of the physics and chemistry of sub-micrometric         aerosol particles that are transported into the arctic by the synoptic-         scale atmospheric circulation and form a component of the layered               pollution structure that has become generally known as Arctic Haze.             Sub-micrometric particles lie in the size range from 0.01 to 1                  micrometer and are advected into the arctic from sub-arctic and mid-            latitude industrial regions, and formed locally by a gas to particle            conversion process.  Measurements of their size distribution,                   concentration, and composition will improve our understanding of their          sources and formation processes, while the chemical parameters will             determine the effectiveness of the particles as cloud condensation              nuclei and allow estimates of their lifetimes and their removal                 mechanism in arctic air masses.",
