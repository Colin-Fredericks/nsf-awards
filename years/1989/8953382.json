 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Association of Biology Teachers, Georgetown University,            and Edvotek, Incorporation, have formed a partnership to make the               introduction of modern molecular biology experiments into high school           courses feasible for all schools.  Workshops will be used to introduce          high school teachers to appropriate experiments and they will then be           able to obtain the necessary materials and equipment from Edvotek,              which has developed an inexpensive line of laboratory equipment                 specifically designed for high school use.  For only $90, about half            the actual cost of consumables and shipping, a school will be able to           obtain a kit containing all the necessary materials, equipment, and             instructions.  Equipment must be returned within four weeks to                  Edvotek, where the kits will be replenished and prepared for                    reshipping.  Schools will have to furnish a purchase order for $1000,           the cost of the kit, when ordering the kit, but this will be returned           when the reusable equipment is returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                        The experiments were designed and the equipment developed in                    conjunction with National Science Foundation-funded teacher workshops           conducted at Georgetown University and other locations in recent                years.  They have been tested by the teachers who have taken the                workshops both in the summer workshops and in their own classes back            at school.                                                                                                                                                      Cost sharing by the partners will total 120% of the National Science            Foundation funding.",
