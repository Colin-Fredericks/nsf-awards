 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project permits Dr. DeNiro and his colleagues to                  continue their investigation into the extent to which diet can be               reconstructed through analysis of skeletal remains.  Research by                Dr. DeNiro and others has shown the feasibility of this approach.               For example, ratios of C12/C13 vary in different species of                     plants, and evidence indicated that such variation is reflected                 in the carbon ratio of skeletal material.  In addition to carbon,               nitrogen, sulfur and strontium may also provide dietary clues.                                                                                                  Dr. DeNiro and his colleagues will study the distribution of                    isotopes among different food types and see how, through                        controlled diet, this is reflected in bone composition.  Since                  bones recovered by archaeologists have usually lain in the ground               for long periods of time and undergone some diagenesis, (post                   mortem alteration), Dr. DeNiro will also study the effects of                   such processes on bone isotope ratios.  He will also study the                  bone and organic residues on pot sherds to reconstruct aspects of               prehistoric diet in coastal  and highland Peru, the Bahamas,                    California and East Africa.                                                                                                                                     Reconstruction of prehistoric diet is important to                              anthropologists because it permits them to understand how                       different groups subsisted and utilized their environment.  It                  also permits them to examine the relationships among diet,                      population growth and disease.",
