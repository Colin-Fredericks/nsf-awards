 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will define the relationship between the molecular                   structure of lipids, their packing in bilayers, and the tendency                of those bilayers to self-organize into lipid tubules as opposed                to liposomes.  A recent theory of tubule formation, proposed by                 P. G. de Gennes, suggests that if lipid bilayer molecular packing               is like that of a smectic C* liquid crystal, effective charge                   separation could cause bilayer strips to curl into helices and                  tubules.  The proposed work will test the structural assumption                 of this theory with regard to the crystallinity of tubules, and                 the theory's qualitative and quantitative predictions.                          Techniques to be used on known and potential tubule forming lipid               systems include a) phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy to                study morphology, helicity, and routes to tubule formation, and                 b) vibrational spectroscopy to determine packing, order,                        hydration, and orientation of molecules within tubules.  The                    effects of ionic strength on formation, morphology, and                         stabilities of tubules and helices will test predictions from the               theory.  Data will be correlated with X-ray studies to develop a                three-dimensional model of bilayer structure in tubules.                                                                                                        This study continues one begun earlier by an expedited award.                   Lipids like those which are the principal structural elements of                cell membranes spontaneously organize into membrane-like                        bilayers.  The investigator was a co-discoverer of a new                        structure, lipid tubules, which can form spontaneously out of                   certain lipid bilayers.  The tubules, only a few molecular layers               thick, have a soda-straw structure.  Study of the phenomenon                    should significantly advance our understanding of structural                    forces inside bilayers, including membrane structures in living                 cells.  This work occurs at the interface between physical                      chemistry, biology, and engineering, though engineering                         applications of tubules are still speculative at this point.                    Lipid tubules have a unique combination  of physical attributes:                they are rigid and straight like crystals and graphite fibers,                  but are hollow, with extremely thin walls; they are also                        biocompatible like liposomes.  There is no other known method to                manufacture structures of their size, shape, and precision.  It                 has already been demonstrated that they can be coated with                      metals.  Potential applications are widespread, from obscuration,               (by their interactions with electromagnetic radiation) through                  repair of demyelinated nerves to structural elements in ceramic                 composites.",
