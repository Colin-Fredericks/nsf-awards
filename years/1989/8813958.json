 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study anaerobic microbial                   transformation of aromatic hydrocarbons in laboratory microcosms                derived from subsurface material.  The substrates to be used in this            research are homocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (mononuclear and                  binuclear), and nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen heterocycles.  The main            thrust of the research is on studying the rates and extent of                   transformation of the model compounds (as single substrates, or in              mixtures) under denitrifying, sulfate-reducing, fermentative, and               transient aerobic/anaerobic conditions.  The experiments will be                carried out in batch and semicontinuously fed column microcosms                 derived from subsurface material.  Pathways of transformations will             also be followed, and for this purpose chromatographic-mass                     spectrometric techniques and radioactive carbon labeling of the                 substrates will be used.  Routes and kinetics of anaerobic                      transformation with different electron acceptors will be investigated           in the context of changing environmental conditions; varying pH,                nutrients, presence and absence of other organic carbon and energy              sources, and influence of other aromatic hydrocarbons in mixtures.                                                                                              Biodegradation of compounds to be studied in this project are                   generally possible under aerobic conditions.  It is not always                  feasible to introduce sufficient aeration into contaminated sites, and          the degree of anaerobicity usually increases with the degree of                 pollution by degradable organic matter.  Results of this project may            provide the basis for an alternative process to decontaminate aquifers          that are contaminated by aromatic hydrocarbons.",
