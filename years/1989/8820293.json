 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale gasdynamical processes are extremely important to an                understanding of the structure and evolution of the Galaxy.  The                development of instabilities in gas flows in the Galactic disk                  and halo may give rise to the intricate structures in the                       Galactic system that are seen directly in optical and radio                     images.  Ultimately, structure on the smallest scales leads to                  star formation.  By and large, what is seen is not well-                        understood.  What is the origin of the gas seen at high Galactic                latitude, and why does it seem to be in a very peculiar state of                ionization?  What is the fate of hot gas in the disk, and under                 what conditions can cool thermal condensations form in a                        dynamically active flow to give rise to the high velocity                       features which are observed?  Why are spiral arms generally                     unkempt with spurs and branches often present, but with some                    galaxies showing an exquisite \"grand design\" structure while                    others appear completely chaotic?                                                                                                                               The theoretical research carried out with this grant addresses                  the questions posed above.  The dynamical structure and the                     stability of astrophysical gas flows will be examined.  The                     projects involve primarily studies of flows on a Galactic scale,                but in some cases there are interesting and fruitful applications               on larger scales.",
