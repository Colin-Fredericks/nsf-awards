 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to examine the role that                       cytoplasmic determinants play in the development of polyclad                    flatworms, one of the most primitive of the spiralians with                     typical quartet spiral cleavage.  Early determination is                        characteristic of the polyclad Hoploplana inquilina but is less                 rigidly programmed than that of the higher spiralians.  Dr. Boyer               proposes to develop a cell lineage of the hoploplana embryo, an                 important tool for analyzing experimental data, by injecting                    fluorescent dextran into blastomeres and tracing the fluorescence               to larval structures.  She will examine development of specific                 larval structures, the determination of symmetry, and the time                  and site of localization of determinants by using blastomere                    deletion and separation techniques, cutting uncleaved eggs, and                 altering cell geometry.  In addition SEM and TEM will be                        employed.                                                                       %%%                                                                             Cytoplasmic localization is a fundamental developmental mechanism               employed by eggs and early embryos in determining the ultimate                  body plan of the adult. This process is most easily studied in                  simple systems. This study will contribute to our understanding                 of one of the universal mechanisms of early development from both               ontogenetic and phylogenetic perspectives.",
