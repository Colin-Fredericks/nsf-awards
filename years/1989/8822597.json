 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports approximately twelve U.S. mathematicians to                 participate in an international workshop on differential equations              and their applications to be held in June, 1989, near Graz, Austria.            The workshop was co-organized by Professors Jerome A. Goldstein of              Tulane University and Franz Kappel and Wilhelm Schappacher of the               Institute for Mathematics of the University of Graz.  The main topics           of the meeting are new directions and trends in the theory of                   differential equations, and applications in biology, physics and                engineering.  Approximately 40 mathematicians will participate,                 primarily from the U.S. and Austria but also from several other                 European countries.  Presentations will include new research results            and methods as well as concrete applications.                                                                                                                   Differential equations form one of the most rapidly developing areas            in mathematical science.  This is due mainly to the manifold                    applications of the theory to other disciplines, including biology,             physics, chemistry, engineering, epidemiology, etc.  This workshop              should facilitate communication and foster collaboration between U.S.           and European mathematicians working in this general area.",
