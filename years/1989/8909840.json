 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this proposal is to develop and optimize a novel                  experimental approach, based on scanning microfluorescence, to                  characterize cellular physiology as a function of both time                     and position within immobilized-cell biocatalysts.  The                         approach will then be used to investigate plasmid stability                     within immobilized Escherichia coli cells.  The method employs                  a biocatalyst configuration which allows visual observation of                  cells entrapped at various distances from the nutrient supply,                  so that well-nourished, as well as starving cells may be                        viewed.  A recently developed scanning microfluorescence                        instrument is also used.  This instrument has advanced image-                   analysis capabilities, and its excitation laser beam can be                     focused to a diameter less than one micron.  These features                     allow fluorescence of individual bacterial cells to be                          measured.  Plasmid stability will be monitored using                            fluorescent marker genes attached to target plasmids.  This                     new analytical approach is both powerful and versatile.  A                      wide variety of immobilized-cell phenomena can be studied by                    changing fluorescent stains.  Results of the study will                         enhance the fundamental understanding of immobilized-cell                       physiology and allow refinements in mathematical models for                     industrially important immobilized-cell processes.",
