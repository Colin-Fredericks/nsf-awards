 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study the extent to which a stream                  ecosystem is a source or sink for energy and nitrogen in the                    larger desert landscape.  Energy flow will be summarized as the                 ratio of primary production to respiration (P/R) and nitrogen                   cycling as the ratio of dinitrogen fixation to denitrification                  (F/D).  Judgments of whether a system is a source or sink will be               generated for nested hierarchys, ranging from the algal                         assemblage to the entire drainage.  Results will test in part the               utility of hierarchical approaches to steam ecology.                                 Disturbance effects generated by flash flooding and drying,                each characteristic of a different hydrologic extreme, will be                  studied in the context of the hierarchy.  Stability of subsystems               will be evaluated in the face of each disturbance and                           combinations of the two.                                                             Detailed study of interactions between surface and hyporheic               zones involving organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen will be                   used to explore how subsystem interaction influences the                        stability of each.  The hypothesis is that vertical exchange                    enhances resilience of both subsystems.                                              Finally, a simulation model will be used To simulate the                   effect of disturbance regimes on the whole drainage system.                     Results will show how disturbance regimes of several years length               influence the linkage of streams with adjacent ecosystems:                      downstream reservoirs, groundwater aquifers, or parallel riparian               communities.                                                                         The investigators are well qualified to run the proposal                   research program, have adequate facilities and have an excellent                publication record.",
