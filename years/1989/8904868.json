Acidic and                        basic groups on the enzyme associated with catalysis and                        substrate binding will be studied using the protocol of pH                      kinetics.  Modification of CyS344 leads to enzyme                               inactivation.  Whether this effect is due to CyS344 being at                    the active site, or whether modification simply prevents AMPS                   synthetase from assuming its native conformation, will be                       investigated using the protocol of site-specific mutagenesis.                                                                                                   Adenylosuccinate (AMPS) synthetase if the first committed                       step in AMP biosynthesis from IMP and therefore plays a                         pivotal role in metabolism.  How this enzyme acts as a                          catalyst and how it is regulated at the molecular level is                      crucial to an understanding of its fundamental role in                          metabolism.",
