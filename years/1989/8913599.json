Technological gatekeepers are individuals in organizations                 to whom others turn to for technical information.  They are key                 elements in an elaborate communication process that influences                  the flow of technical information into and within an                            organization.                                                                        Data will be collected to ascertain the degree to which                    technological gatekeeping is a role enacted by members of the                   Industrial Advisory Board members at selected I/UCRC's.  Finally,               conclusions will be drawn relating the technological gatekeeping                function to issues of information dissemination within member                   firms and the retention of firms as Center members.                                  The principal investigator is qualified to conduct this                    study, and the Program Manager recommends an award of $29,512 for               one year.",
