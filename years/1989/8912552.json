 "awd_abstract_narration": "What people do (i.e., work, save, or spend) depends in part on                  what they expect the future to be.  Their actions, in turn,                     influence what actually happens in the future.  Rational                        expectations models of economic behavior are based on a key                     requirement that a person's expectations about the future be                    consistent with the logical consequences of their current                       decisions.                                                                                                                                                      A better understanding of many macroeconomic phenomena has been                 gained by the development of rational-expectations equilibrium                  models.  Nonetheless, current economic theory leaves some crucial               questions unanswered.   Specifically, economic models in which                  multiple pairs of mutually consistent actions and expectations                  exist yield ambiguous predictions and policy prescriptions.  This               problem could be resolved if it were known how people learn from                expectations.  For example, in current models of the dynamics of                hyperinflation, it impossible to know, with any reasonable                      precision, the impact of reducing government deficits on                        inflation.  In order to better understand the causes of inflation               and to discover effective counter measures, it is necessary to                  learn much more about how people form expectations.  The purpose                of this project is to develop innovative laboratory methods and                 to apply them to the analysis of expectation formation,                         inflation, and government deficits.",
