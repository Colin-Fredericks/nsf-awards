 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the central problems in protein chemistry is to discover                 what determines three-dimensional structure.  Proteolytic enzymes               are involved in regulation of a great number of physiological                   processes.  In some cases, proteases cleave a fragment from an                  inactive precursor in order to convert it to an active protein;                 in other cases, proteolysis ends a cycle of enzymatic activity.                 Proteases may also act to remove damaged tissue, as part of the                 repair process.  It is of interest to design new inhibitors for                 proteases, both with an eye to possible therapeutic uses of these               inhibitors, and also with the aim of studying the interaction                   between protease and inhibitor.  Many small organic molecules                   have been shown to be effective inhibitors of serine proteases in               vitro, but they do not mimic the fit between the natural                        inhibitor and its target protein.  Rather, they mimic the fit                   between substrate and protease.  This project will entail                       inserting a sequence from antitrypsin into human interleukin so                 that it will inhibit elastase from human leukocytes.  Unique                    restriction sites in the synthetic gene being used allow the gene               to be cut in the region to be mutated, and the appropriate DNA to               be ligated.  Expression of the mutated gene will be followed by                 purification of the desired protein.  The new protein will be                   tested for binding to elastase and for elastase-inhibitory                      activity and will be examined by X-ray crystallography.  This                   project should help to answer the question of whether the three-                dimensional structure is determined purely by the sequence of                   amino acids, or whether the rest of the protein plays a role in                 stabilizing, or even determining the characteristics of the loop.",
