 "awd_abstract_narration": "The orthodox view of spontaneous mutations is that they arise                   continually and at random, without reference to their ultimate                  utility.  However, in Escherichia coli, many of the mutations                   that convey immediately-expressed phenotypes arise after the                    application of the very selection that allows for their                         detection.  Indeed, some classes of rare mutational events,                     such as those that activate cryptic operons, are only observed                  in stationary-phase cells under selective conditions.  The                      mechanism of this post-selection mutational process is unknown.                 Bacterial variants (mutants) that are defective in the process,                 will be isolated.  This will be done by mutagenizing bacteria                   that carry two cryptic operons, one for salicin (bg1o) and one                  for lactose utilization (ebgo), and screening for variants that                 cannot mutate spontaneously to Sal+ or to Lac+.  The phenotypes                 of the variants obtained will be extensively characterized.                     The specific genetic defects will be identified by conventional                 mapping techniques and cloning.  If conditional-lethal variants                 are obtained, suppressors of this  phenotype will be selected                   for and characterized.   Ultimately, this approach should allow                 the pathway of post-selection mutagenesis to be deduced.",
