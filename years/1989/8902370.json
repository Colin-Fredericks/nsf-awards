Velocity, stable species                                                                                                   concentrations, and temperatures are to be measured across the                                                                                                  channel and the heat flux distribution along the wall will be                                                                                                   monitored.  Numerical modeling of the reacting flow will                        accompany the experiments, with the stated overall objective                    of predicting the detailed thermal and chemical performance of                                                                                                  an exhaust gas catalytic reactor under steady-state and                         transient conditions.
