 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, within the Organic Dynamics Program, involves the                 continuing work of C. De Puy and V. Bierbaum of the University                  of Colorado.  They will generate highly reactive, ionic species                 by electron impact under high vacuum, and observe, by mass                      spectrometry, reactions resulting from the collision of these                   ions with neutral molecules.  This will lead to a better                        understanding of organic ionic reactions by removing the                        effects of solvation which are present in condensed phase                       reactions.                                                                                                                                                      Reactions between ions and neutral molecules in a flowing                       afterglow selected ion flow tube apparatus will be studied.                     Ions will be generated by electron impact or by other methods                   including ion synthesis reactions, separated from other ions                    and neutral precursors in a quadrupole mass filter and injected                 into a flow tube together with 0.5 torr of helium.  Highly                      reactive ions, as for example CH anion, will be allowed to                      react with a variety of neutral reagents in order to compare                    their reaction rates and product channels with more                             conventional reactant ions.  Isotopically labeled ions,                         particularly those containing S-34, Cl-37, O-18 and C-13, will                  be used as tracers to examine rates for reactions which would                   otherwise be hidden as in, for example, that between HS-34                      anion and hydrogen sulfide (S-32). Positively charged                           hydrocarbon cations which are expected to occur in the                          interstellar medium will be allowed to react with molecules                     (e.g., water) known to be present in space in an attempt to                     understand the origin of organic molecules under the unusual                    conditions of space.  The acidity of very weakly acidic                         molecules, for example amines, heteroaromatic compounds and                     alkanes, will be probed by chemical reactions of silanes.  The                  overall goal is to understand the details of simple organic                     ionic reactions by removing the obscuring effects of solvation.",
