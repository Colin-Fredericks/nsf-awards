 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soot formed in hydrocarbon flames varies in size and composition with           stoichiometry and residence time.  To study the fundamental processes           associated with soot formation and oxidation, laser probes are used             for in situ measurement of the particle size and number density.                Critical to the interpretation of the scattered and absorbed laser              light is the particle index of refraction.  The proposed research will          determine the index of refraction as a  function of the soot C/H                ratio, the particle temperature, and the amount of iron carbonyl added          to the fuel.  Measurements will be limited to the lower regions of              premixed hydrocarbon-air flat flames where the soot particles are much          smaller than the wavelength of the laser probe.  Reflectivity                   measurements will also be made on extracted samples heated up to 1100           K.  Particle temperature in the flame will be controlled through high           power pulsed IR laser illumination synchronized with a visible laser            probe.                                                                                                                                                          If the research is successful, the ability to quantify with less                uncertainty the number density and size distribution of soot particles          will enhance investigations into the formation of soot in hydrocarbon           flames, and increase the accuracy of radiative heat transfer                    calculations.  This study will also provide the first ever assessment           of the effect of a metal additive on sub-                                       100 nm soot particle optical properties, and could lead to a                    model experiment for investigating other heavy metal and                        chlorinated additives.",
