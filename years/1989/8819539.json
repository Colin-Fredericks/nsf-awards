This conference is a continuation of a series of three                   previous conferences held in the United States and several others               sponsored by the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO)                 in the last two decades.  The last major conference was held in                 Port Aransas, Texas in April of 1985.                                                                                                                           Ribosomes are part of the cell's machinary for making proteins.                 Work on ribosomes has intensified in recent years as molecular                  techniques have been applied to the problems of structure,                      function and genetics of ribosomes.  It is important for those                  working with ribosomes to meet periodically to review the status                of the field and share new results.  This conference will perform               this function.",
