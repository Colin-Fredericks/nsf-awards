 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the factors that control production of                       supercooled liquid water in mountainous terrain is not only an                  important fundamental research question, but such knowledge is                  needed to advance techniques of enhancing winter-time                           orographic precipitation.  During the Austral winter of 1988,                   various Australian agencies conducted a winter storms                           experiment to improve knowledge of winter extratropical                         cyclones interacting with mountainous terrain.  The major                       research objectives of the experiment are to measure the                        mesoscale water budget near mountainous terrain during the                      passage of extratropical cyclones and to understand how this                    budget is affected by mesoscale cloud structure and kinematics                  and microphysical processes.                                                         The Principal Investigator will assist in analyzing the                    data collected during this project which includes state-of-the-                 art measurements from a microwave radiometer, pulsed lidar,                     rawindsondes, research aircraft  and surface precipitation                      measurements.  Specifically, supercooled liquid water and ice                   mass fluxes across a mountain crest will be calculated and                      related to mesoscale weather features.  Results will lead to a                  better understanding of orographic precipitation formation                      processes.  //",
