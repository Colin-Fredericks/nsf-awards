 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developed under the leadership of Florida A&M                     University (FAMU), establishes the Florida Comprehensive State                  Center for Minorities in Science & Technology. Cooperating                      institutions and organizations, in addition to the University                   include the following: Bethune-Cookman College, Edward Waters                   College,  Florida Memorial College and Miami-Dade Community College             (which are all minority institutions); the FAMU/Industry Cluster;               Dade, Duval and Leon School Districts; and, the Florida Department of           Education.                                                                                                                                                      Figures on the minority enrollment in the cooperating colleges and              universities show a total of 42,500 students (Black and Hispanic),              which is 74% of the total enrollment in those institutions. Minority            enrollment in the targeted school systems is 250,000 (Black and                 Hispanic), representing 60% of the total enrollment.                                                                                                            The Center is developing, and implementing programs designed: to                identify and track academically promising minority students who                 demonstrate a propensity for learning mathematics and science; to               improve the quality of mathematics and science instruction received             by minority students in Florida; to improve academic achievement of             minority undergraduate students enrolled in science, mathematics and            engineering programs; and, to increase the number of Florida minority           students who earn graduate degrees in science, mathematics and                  engineering.                                                                                                                                                    A triumvirate of community, government, and business are engaged in             collaborative efforts to deliver these programs through five                    regional centers affiliated with the cooperating minority                       institutions listed above. In its first year of operation, the                  Center is expected to serve 1,100 students (Grades 4-12), 440                   undergraduates, 190 precollege teachers, 100 college faculty, and 30            school counselors.                                                                                                                                              The organizational structure of the Center involves an Executive                Board, a National Advisory Council, Public and Private Sector                   Allies, with activities centered in the five regional centers, each             of which is in turn affiliated with school districts and local                  organizations. The Center is implementing a data-based student                  reporting and tracking system to monitor student progress and success           over time.                                                                                                                                                      Center programs include activities for both pre-service and in-                 service teachers, student-focused activities for elementary, middle             and high school students, high school to college transition programs,           undergraduate programs at the freshman and sophomore level, and                 undergraduate research participation. Workshops for parents and                 counselors are also provided. In addition, a National Conference on             Strategies for Increasing the Pool of Minority Science and                      Mathematics Teachers will be held during the second, third, fourth,",
