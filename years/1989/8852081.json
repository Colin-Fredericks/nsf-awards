 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to provide all undergraduate                   mechanical engineering students with a capstone, open-ended                     laboratory experience near the end of their education in which                  they must apply various principles of science and mathematics in a              team effort to solve an engineering problem experimentally.  To                 accomplish this, state-of-the-art equipment is needed for a Diesel              Engine Center and a Textile Drying Center, and expansions of                    Centers for Mechanics of Materials, Tribology, Controls, and                    Vibrations.  Each Center is a fully-instrumented facility,                      coordinated by a faculty member, pertaining to a particular area                of mechanical engineering and incorporating the use of the                      computer as a resource for data acquisition and reduction, and                  preparation of results for presentation.  When completed, the                   experimental centers will provide a quality structured environment              for a required laboratory course.",
