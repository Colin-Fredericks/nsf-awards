 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Stephen Milne.               His work will concentrate on the interrelationships among the                   fields of Combinatorics, Lie Algebras, and Hypergeometric Series.               His principal goal will be to develop the theory and applications               of his recent U(n) generalization of the Bailey Transform and the               Bailey Lemma. This program has already led to the discovery and                 proof of many new theorems for multiple q-series and summations,                connection coefficient theory, orthogonal polynomials, and                      related combinatorial applications.                                                  This research falls in the broad category of Combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Fundamentally, Combinatorics represents a systematization of the                very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                     modern development, however, Combinatorics has gone beyond just                 counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                 techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the               field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                  because of its importance in communications and information                     technology.",
