 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flat-plate is one of the most widely used forms of construction                 among the low-to-medium-rise residential or office buildings.                   Recent earthquakes such as the Armenian (1988) and Mexican                      (1985) earthquakes have proven the susceptibility of such                       buildings to severe damage.  In situations where an independent                 lateral load resisting system is not present or is rendered                     ineffective, the survival of such buildings in the event of an                  earthquake depends entirely on the performance of slab-to-                      column connections.  The use of high strength concrete and                      fiber reinforced concrete in the connection region or the                       addition of shear caps can possibly improve the shear strength                  of slab-column connections without resorting to other relatively                more expensive alternatives.  Eight one-half scale two-bay flat-                plate subassemblies will be tested under simulated earthquake-                  type loading to investigate the promise of such alternatives in                 improving the seismic resistance of flat-plate buildings.  This                 study should provide the basis for improved safety of flat-plate                buildings to include the use of high strength and fiber                         reinforced concrete and for further improvements in analytical                  modelling of the unbalanced moment transfer mechanism at the                    slab-column connections.",
