 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are 71 genera of palms known to occur in the New                     World, but only about one-third of these genera are well                        collected and well known taxonomically.  This is unfortunate                    because palms are important components of tropical forests and                  savannas, and are also widely used as crops.  Drs. Andrew                       Henderson and Michael Balick of the New York Botanical Garden are               conducting field work in South America along with herbarium and                 laboratory studies to determine the species composition and                     geographical ranges of two poorly known genera, Euterpe and                     Prestoea.  Prestoea contains an estimated 35 species, while                     Euterpe contains about ten; both are widely distributed in                      Central and South America.  Euterpe is economically significant                 as a source of palm \"hearts.\"  Their taxonomic studies will be                  based on morphological and anatomical analyses of flowers,                      fruits, leaves, and stems.  Material will also be sent to Cornell               University for molecular studies by Drs. Doyle and Uhl on the                   palm family and its evolution.  Field work will be conducted with               the collaboration of the Colombian botanist, Dr. Gloria Galeano-                Garces.",
