Starch is synthesized and stored in the chloroplast during the                  day, and degraded at night when the plant cell needs carbon                     fragments for respiration and other metabolic processes.  Sucrose               is the major transport form of reduced carbon and is exported                   from leaves to other parts of the plant.  It is synthesized in                  the cytosol from triose phosphate, which is the main form of                    reduced carbon exported from the chloroplast during active                      photosynthesizing periods.  These processes require fructose 1,6                bisphosphatase; in both cases the enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis               of fructose 1,6 bisphosphate to fructose 6 phosphate and                        inorganic phosphate.  These isozymes are localized in different                 compartments of the plant cell, differ in molecular structure,                  kinetics and regulation and are thought to be coded by nuclear                  genes.  The aims of this research project are: (1) to isolate and               characterize cDNA clones encoding cytoplasmic and chloroplast                   fructose 1,6 bisphosphatases from spinach; (2) to study the                     differential light regulated expression characteristics of the                  genes; (3) to utilize fructose 1,6, bisphosphatase recombinant                  DNA and antibody probes to study the expression of fructose 1,6                 bisphosphatase mRNAs and polypeptides during the photosynthetic                 process.                                                                                                                                                        The results of these studies will provide understanding of the                  different structural and expression characteristics of two forms                of an enzyme which plays a role in photosynthetic carbon fixation               and partitioning in higher plants, the determinants of plant                    productivity.",
