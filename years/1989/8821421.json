 "awd_abstract_narration": "Felix Klein is universally regarded as one of the most important                mathematicians of modern times, and the lack of a major                         biographical study devoted to his career is certainly one of the                more glaring gaps in the literature in the history of                           mathematics.  Familiar to all serious students of mathematics,                  Klein has also figured prominently in reform movements in                       technology, science, and mathematics education. He is also widely               known for his classic \"Vorlesungen uber die Entwicklung der                     Mathematik im 19. Jahrhundert,\" which remains unique as an                      overview of the personalities, institutions and ideas that shaped               the world of mathematics in the modern era.                                                                                                                     All of these achievements were overshadowed by Klein's success                  and influence as a scientific organizer and the leading architect               of the modern Gottingen mathematical tradition.  By attracting                  colleagues like David Hilbert, Hermann Minkowski, Carl Runge,                   Ludwig Prantl, Edmund Landau, Hermann Weyl, Richard Courant, et                 al., Klein not only dethroned the once omnipotent Berlin                        establishment, he ensured Gottingen's dominance as the leading                  center for mathematics in Germany and the world up until the time               of the Nazi takeover eight years after his death.                                                                                                               Dr. Rowe is continuing his project whose ultimate aim is to                     produce a large-scale scientific biography of Felix Klein (1849-                1925).  Under this grant, he will analyze Klein's early                         geometrical works and those of his collaborator, Sophus Lie.  Dr.               Rowe will also prepare an annotated edition of Klein's                          unpublished lectures on elliptic function theory.  Finally, he                  will collaborate with Renate Tobies and Walter Purkert on a                     shorter biography of Klein to be included in the Birkhauser                     series \"Vita Mathematica.\"",
