 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study problems in billiards                which model important questions from Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser                    theory, as well as quadratic differentials and Teichmuller                      theory.  He will investigate whether convergence of ergodic                     averages for measured foliations can be estimated if one knows                  the orbit of the Teichmuller geodesic it determines.  Another                   important question addressed in this project concerns the                       extremal length geometry of Teichmuller space.  Specifically, are               there a finite number of curves whose extremal lengths determine                the Riemann surface?                                                                 Invariant annular bands arise in the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser               theory of turbulence.  Iterations of functions on these bands can               be modeled by angles and locations of bounces of a billiard ball                on a circular table.  For these reasons, the principal                          investigator might shed light on relevant questions of turbulence               (and the shape of ships' hulls) by answering questions described                by the game of billiards.  For example, how many of the possible                directions that one might hit a billiard ball carry the ball in                 a periodic trajectory, so that the ball eventually returns to the               exact same spot travelling in the exact same direction?  Does the               location of the ball or shape of the table make a difference?",
