 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the topical area of chemistry and in the subfield of                         immunochemistry.  The thrust of this activity is research leading               to defining the extent to which nonaqueous immunochemical                       processes can be generalized.  Immunochemical techniques have many              diverse applications.  However, they are restricted to use only in              aqueous media.  Economical techniques for direct organic phase                  analysis and immunoaffinity isolation would significantly broaden               the usefulness of antibody-based technology.  The purpose of this               project is to determine the feasibility of exploiting antigen-                  antibody binding in the organic phase.  A series of solvents,                   antibodies, and antigens will be selected to identify the                       parameters influencing antigen-antibody binding in nonaqueous                   solvents.  Detectable specific binding will be the basis for                    justifying development of organic phase immunoassays, affinity                  isolation techniques, and other novel applications for antibodies.                                                                                              Successful demonstration of specific antigen-antibody binding in                nonaqueous phases could be the basis for developing useful new                  immunochemical technology.  Environmental and clinical monitoring               could benefit from a marked improvement in the analysis of                      pesticides and lipid-soluble drugs.  The production and quality                 control of pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and industrial organic                  chemicals would be enhanced by organic phase immunoassay                        determination of trace contaminants, real-time monitoring of                    undesired side reactions, immunoaffinity removal of trace metal                 contaminants from process streams, and enhanced efficiency of                   chemical processes with catalytic antibodies.  Additionally,                    significant improvements in enantiomeric separation and                         stereoselective synthesis could be achieved.",
