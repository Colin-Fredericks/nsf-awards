 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquid helium displays a number of interesting properties at low                temperatures.  Some are unique to this quantum fluid, others are                common to other systems, but observable with a higher degree of                 precision in helium.  They have been studying critical behavior                 at the superfluid transition in the limit where helium is                       confined to such small dimensions that it no longer behaves as a                three dimensional system.  They have devised a technique for                    confining the helium between two well-spaced silicon wafers.                    They report first measurements of the superfluid density in                     which, as one approaches the superfluid transition, the helium                  deviates from three-dimensional behavior and then crosses over                  into two dimensions.  They propose to continue these                            investigations for the next funding period as well as to start                  measurements of heat capacity.  These data will provide stringent               tests of finite-size scaling theories and dimensionality                        crossover.  At low temperatures they have studied the superfluid                transiton of near-monolayer films of 4He with 3He as an impurity.               They report the observation that the transition of these films                  into the superfluid state takes place in two steps.  They                       interpret this as a signature of the formation of the surface                   state for 3He.  They propose to continue with these measurements                to study other phenomena associated with the phase transition and               the hydrodynamic mass of 3He.",
