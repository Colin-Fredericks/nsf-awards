 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recently introduced non-aqueous lyotropic liquid crystals                   have been investigated for their lubrication properties under a                 previous NSF grant (MSM-8716928).  They demonstrated performance                as lubricants far superior to commercial greases with respect to                the friction coefficients, which were as low as 0.02.  In                       addition, they are able to accommodate additives of such a nature               that they cannot be used in conventional greases.  These factors                indicate potential for non-aqueous lyotropic liquid crystals to                 develop into a new class of advanced lubricants.                                                                                                                The project funded under this grant is one part of a coordinated                basic research program to probe the mechanism for the ultralow                  friction coefficients and to synthesize and incorporate new                     additives into the formulations.  The new additives, adjusted to                the properties of liquid crystals, will be synthesized at the                   University of Turin, Italy.  Characterization of the liquid                     crystal lubricants using various state-of-the-art techniques from               colloid chemistry will be performed at Clarkson University (this                grant).  Tribological analysis will be performed at the                         University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (funded by the Tribology                      Program).  Travel funds for coordination of the research have                   been provided by the Italian National Research Council.  The                    program at Clarkson will emphasize three points:  (1) An                        explanation of the low friction coefficients.  (2) exploitation                 of the structure of the liquid crystal lubricant to incorporate                 lubricant additives with structures incompatible with hydrocarbon               based lubricants.  (3) The integrity of the liquid crystal                      structure against decomposition products of the original                        components, which could potentially move the multicomponent                     system into a region of the phase space where liquid crystals do                not form.",
