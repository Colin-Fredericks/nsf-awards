 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many parts of the world, a significant form of human impact on          the natural environment has been the disruption caused by using                 hydraulic mining techniques.  These techniques, which use pressurized           water to loosen and transport enormous amounts of overburden and ore,           introduced enormous quantities of sediment and waste water into natural         watersheds.  The earliest large-scale use of hydraulic mining in the            United States took place in the gold fields of northern California              between the 1850s and the 1880s.  Considerable attention was focused            on the processes of human-induced geomorphic change by scientists               including G.K. Gilbert in the early decades of this century, but                physical geographers, geologists, hydrologists, and other scholars have         turned their attention toward other facets of sedimentary processes in          more recent decades.  This project will build upon earlier studies of           the impacts of hydraulic mining in northern California and more recent          work on human-related sedimentary activity to examine the ongoing               redistribution of sediment in the upper stretches of the Bear and South         Yuba rivers.  The project will consist of four interrelated parts:              (1) past and present locations and volumes of mining sediments will be          mapped using aerial photographs, satellite images, and samples taken            during field surveys, (2) measurements of sustained sediment mobility           will be made, (3) the changes in stream channels and sediment                   distributions resulting from a record flood in 1986 will be determined,         and (4) the extent of mixing between mining and non-mining sediments            will be measured.                                                                    This research will have a number of theoretical and practical              benefits.  It will provide the first long-term reassessment of a model          of sediment transport first developed by Gilbert in the 1910s, using            measurement and analytic techniques that can be used by scholars                elsewhere.  Although focusing on sediments resulting from mining                activities, the project will provide more accurate estimates of the             rate and volume of movement for all types of sediments within streams.          This improved understanding will provide a basis for more effective             decision making regarding the cessation and clean-up of accelerated             sedimentation in the nation's streams.",
