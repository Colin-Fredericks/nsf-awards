A further purpose is to motivate junior high school                   and high school students to study science.  Three recent NSF                    grants funded the preparation of a teacher's manual, Science                    in Cinema, recently published by Teachers College Press,                        describing the scientific principles illustrated or violated                    in a number of science fiction films and the techniques                         needed to use these films in pre-college science courses.  A                    model teacher training program involving 24 pre-college                         science teachers was also conducted.  The 13 test classes of                    students demonstrated an improvement in attitude toward                         science, in understanding of science as a discovery process,                    and in cognitive development that was statistically                             significantly better than the control classes.  The teachers                    participated in a ten-day summer institute and received a six                   follow-up days of instruction throughout the year.                                                                                                              This grant is to test the effectiveness of a much shorter,                      three-day institute, to be conducted during the school year                     by project staff utilizing the now-tested teaching materials.                   Teachers will meet for two additional group self-help                           sessions under the supervision of a master high school                          science teacher.  This will serve as the model format of                        future workshops that may be held around the country in which                   outside experts will train local teachers for three days, who                   will then implement this technique with self-help sessions.                                                                                                     There will be extensive pre- and post-testing of the                            effectiveness of this shorter format on the students of the                     participating teachers.  Dissemination of the results will be                   via national publications.  The project will also initiate                      use of the home VCR as an educational tool since over two-                      thirds of American homes now have a VCR.                                                                                                                        An amount equivalent to 43% of the NSF award is being                           contributed by Temple University as cost-sharing.",
