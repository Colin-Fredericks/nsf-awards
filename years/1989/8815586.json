 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued collaborative research between                Dr. Eugene Stanley, Center for Polymer Studies, Boston University               and Dr. M. Daoud, Laboratoire Leon Brillouin, Centre d'Energie                  Nucleaire, Saclay, France.  The major focus of this work is to                  seek a better understanding of the fundamental physical laws                    underlying a variety of phenomena of relevance to polymer physics               and  aggregation.                                                                                                                                               The investigators propose to continue work recently begun on the                following topics:                                                                                                                                               1.  Swelling of branched polymers and gels.                                     2.  Viscoelastic and other dynamical effects.                                   3.  The effective dimension of the shortest path between two                        points in a fractal object.                                                 4.  Gelation by additive polymerization.                                        5.  Physical basis of fracture phenomena.                                                                                                                       In addition, they propose to investigate a variety of new topics,               including the possible role of magnetic frustration in                          high-temperature superconductivity.                                                                                                                             This work will benefit from the complementary expertise of Drs.                 Stanley and Daould in polymer physics, as well as the computing                 facilities available at the two institutions.",
