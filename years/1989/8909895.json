 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neural stimulation of the chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland                 results in the secretion of catecholamines (epinephrine and                     norepinephrine) into the blood stream.  Circulating                             catecholamines are subsequently involved in the regulation of                   many processes in the cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive                 systems.  Although the cellular events which respond to neural                  stimulation and result in catecholamine secretion are poorly                    understood, an increase in the intracellular level of calcium                   (Ca2+) plays a central role in this process.  Many of the                       intracellular activities regulated by the Ca2+ are mediated by                  the Ca2+ receptor protein calmodulin and various Ca2+/calmodulin-               dependent enzymes which it controls.  One of these is a Ca2+-                   dependent phosphatase, which regulates the activity of other                    proteins and enzymes by removing a phosphate group from them and                altering their structure and subsequently their activity.  The                  objective of this project is to investigate the role of the                     phosphatase in the chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland.  The                  adrenal phosphatase will be purified and characterized, for                     comparison  to the well characterized Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent                 phosphatase from brain.  Chromaffin cell proteins which are                     dephosphorylated by the phosphatase in response to stimulation                  will be identified and characterized and their dephosphorylation                correlated with increases in intracellular Ca2+ and catecholamine               secretion, in order to understand their role and that of the                    phosphatase in catecholamine release.  The results of this study                will provide insight into cellular mechanisms by which Ca2+                     regulates  catecholamine release from chromaffin cells as well as               the role of the phosphatase in stimulus-secretion coupling in the               adrenal gland and other secretory organs.  The Ca2+/calmodulin-                 dependent phosphatase is a major calmodulin-dependent enzyme in                 the brain and may represent a primary target for Ca2+ in the                    cellular events resulting in neurotransmission.",
