The SWD-PSI catalogs                                     extend hundreds and thousands of years into                                     the past providing real physical data on the                                    cataclysmic floods that are most problematic                                    to estimate by conventional methods.  The                                       present work capitalizes on this scientific                                     breakthrough by improving and standardizing                                     SWD-PSI methodology; by developing new                                          procedures for flood paleomagnitude and age                                     estimation; by incorporating paleoflood data                                    into flood frequency analysis; by                                               establishing criteria for data collection and                                   other applications; and by studying  the                                        spatial and temporal patterns of                                                extraordinary floods in relation to                                             regionalization and climate variability.
