 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research and development of a new type                 of linear accelerator structure, the superconducting Radio                      Frequency Quadrupole (SRFQ).  Both superconducting linac                        techniques and RFQ technology have reached a sufficiently                       advanced state so that the combination of the two may be tried                  with a large degree of confidence.  This research will advance                  the science of superconducting accelerators and provide a new                   and unique tool for many important applications such as the                     100% duty factor acceleration of very low velocity ion beams.                   The goal of the proposed project is to design, build and test a                 complete prototype unit.  The design study will investigate the                 problem of longitudinal and radial matching between the ion                     source and the RFQ as well as between RFQ units, fringe fields                  problems, and the accelerating field variation along the RFQ.                   Resonator studies, also will be carried out.  These will                        include analytic and numerical investigations of the 4-rod RFQ                  parameters and comparison with the 4-vane RFQ.                                       Following the design studies, a prototype unit will be                     constructed.  Tests of the RFQ in the normal-conducting and                     superconducting states, including bead tests, calibration of                    the probes, test for multipactoring, low field Q and high field                 performance, will be carried out.  The project will culminate                   in beam tests of the superconducting RFQ.",
