 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a one-year research visit by Dr. Roozbeh                Kangari, School of Civil Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology,          to the Advanced Robotics Laboratory of the Shimizu Corporation,                 Tokyo, Japan.  The Shimizu Corporation is the largest construction              company in Japan, and has a highly advanced construction robotics               laboratory.  Dr. Kangari will carry out research there in the area of           robotics and automation in construction, and he expects to establish            a base for continuing collaboration between Georgia Tech and Shimizu            in this field.  Information, ideas, skills, and techniques used in              the research and development of robots will be exchanged between the            U.S. investigator and the Japanese researchers. The ultimate goal of            this project is the establishment of a world-class construction                 robotics center within the Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems            (CIMS) Robotics Laboratory at Georgia Tech.  An important aim of this           center will be to help increase productivity in the U.S. construction           industry, and make U.S. contractors more competitive in the world               market.                                                                                                                                                         Robotics and automation are likely to play an increasingly important            role in the construction industry in the years ahead.  They are                 expected to increase productivity, improve quality, reduce costs,               increase efficiency, and improve safety in the construction work                environment.  Japanese construction companies have been actively                involved in research and development of construction robots, and are            aggressively transferring advanced technology from the research                 laboratory to the construction site.  Dr. Kangari's visit to the                Advanced Robotics Laboratory of the Shimizu Corporation is expected             to provide him with knowledge and experience that should greatly                facilitate the establishment of a construction robotics center at the           CIMS Robotics Laboratory at Georgia Tech.",
