 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are 1) to improve the commutation                strategy of switched reluctance motor (SRM) controllers in order to             minimize the amplitude and the rate of change of stator currents; and           2) to determine the most suitable SRM flux and torque characteristics           for use with controllers based on the linearizing and decoupling                transformation (LDT).                                                                                                                                           The proposed research involves the extension of methods recently                developed by the principal investigator in the area of SRM control.             The approach involves a two stage design process:  first, an inner              feedback loop \"transforms\" the multiple-input nonlinear SRM dynamics            into those of a single-input linear system; second, an outer feedback           loop is designed for the specific control task using well-known linear          techniques.                                                                                                                                                     The first phase of research will be performed from the viewpoint f              control design.  The objective will be to optimize the existing LDT             algorithm in order to make the  best use of power electronic                    technology.  The second phase of the research, performed from the               viewpoint of machine design, will determine the best SRM                        specifications for use with the LDT algorithm.  Hence, the result of            the latter work will be a \"target machine\" to be an SRM design                  objective.  The research will be based on mathematical optimization             theory, and will involve detailed simulation studies as well as                 laboratory experimentation.",
