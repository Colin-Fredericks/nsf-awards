 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on improving performance appraisal decisions              within organizations.  It emphasizes the role of decision making and            memory and seeks to strengthen the linkages between performance                 appraisal decisions and other aspects of organizational behavior.               Specific questions to be addressed include the organization of                  information in memory, the ability to recall that information, the              ability of ratings based on recall to discriminate effectively between          conditions, and the reactions of raters to the performance appraisal            process.  The study extends previous laboratory-based work conducted by         the investigators to a field study involving a willing corporate                collaborator (Southwestern Bell Telephone) that will test the                   effectiveness of various memory interventions.  This cooperation should         lead to specific improvements in the art and science of performance             appraisal.  The project also will help to illuminate important aspects          of managerial decision making and the role of cognitive processes in            organizational behavior and design.",
