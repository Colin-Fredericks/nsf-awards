Students will be               directly involved with \"hands-on bench research\", reading reviews               and the primary literature, discussing their projects with the                  investigator, graduate students, research assistants and                        postdoctorals in individual weekly lab meetings, making                         presentations to the department, as well as giving papers at                    regional and national professional meetings.  Student-faculty and               undergraduate-graduate student interactions, student                            participation in professional activities, the commitment and                    financial support provided by the institution, the presence of                  support groups such as Sigma Xi, the opportunity for                            participation in the national biology honorary, Beta Beta Beta,                 and exposure to a group of dedicated faculty researchers                        representing both sexes and diverse ethnic/race backgrounds who                 provide useful \"role models\", help to encourage undergraduates to               pursue research careers.  Students from undergraduate colleges in               the greater Cincinnati area and several other liberal arts                      colleges and public and private universities in the state of Ohio               and neighboring state will be recruited for this program.                       Approximately half of the students selected will be from outside                the University of Cincinnati in an effort to include those who                  ordinarily do not have research opportunities available to them.                Student selections will be based on achievements in course work,                taking into consideration participation in other activities,                    evaluations of their performance by persons who are familiar with               the candidates, and previous research experience.  A statement of               research interest will be used for matching a supervisor with a                 trainee.  Qualified, minorities and the disabled will be                        recruited by direct contacts as well as normal means of                         recruitment.",
