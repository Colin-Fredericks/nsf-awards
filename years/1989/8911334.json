 "awd_abstract_narration": "High corporate debt levels have caused concern about the                        potential economic costs of widespread failures in a recession.                 This project models the effects of bankruptcy and financial                     distress and provides empirical evidence on the costs of                        financial distress.                                                                                                                                             Financial structure should affect the economic performance of                   distressed firms only if it is impossible to renegotiate debt                   contracts costlessly.  This project explores renegotiation costs                and their effect on the investment efficiency of troubled firms.                The project analyzes the inefficiencies created by needing to                   reach agreement with several creditors rather than one.  The role               of reorganization law to promote investment efficiency is                       explored.                                                                                                                                                       The costs of financial distress are studied empirically.  It is                 inherently difficult to distinguish financial distress from poor                economic performance.  The project attempts to do this by                       analyzing firm value response to adverse shocks as a function of                leverage, controlling for the economic characteristics of the                   firm and industry.  It studies the performance of firms in                      distressed industries in order to pick out the important sources                of the indirect costs of financial distress as well as what                     determines if firms will use bankruptcy to restructure.                                                                                                         This research deals with a timely and extremely important topic.                Economic observers, policy makers and the press have expressed                  serious concerns that a recession will lead to wide-scale                       corporate bankruptcies which will impose large costs on the                     economy.  Bank regulators are worried about the levels of risky                 debt taken by deposit-insured banks.  The contribution of this                  project comes from incorporating into models of bankruptcy many                 of the important features of bankruptcy law that are ignored by                 existing models.  The research will provide new evidence into                   the relationships between bankruptcy and the costs of financial                 distress.",
