 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use multi.dimensional X.ray diffraction                       techniques to obtain high resolution molecular structures of                    polymerizable lipids in hydrated bilayers.  It will determine the               relationship between molecular structure of lipid monomers and                  the ultrastructures they form.  The focus will be on diacetylenic               phosphatidylcholines, which form tubular ultrastructures which do               appear by some criteria to have a nearly crystalline lattice                    structure, but do not polymerize as well as other diacetylenic                  molecules.  The investigator will also attempt to develop a                     rational theory for the formation of chiral tubules and identify                the structural parameters which promote optimal diacetylenic                    polymerization of amphiphilic diacetylenes.                                                                                                                     Polymerizable lipids are surfactants with a reactive group that                 allows surfactant monomers to be cross.linked by chemical or                    photochemical catalysis.  The liposomes or films formed by these                lipids are thereby more robust than those made of conventional                  lipids and may be more effective in a variety of applications                   such as synthetic membranes for separations and chemical sensors,               thin films for new electronic devices, and biomedical                           applications.  In addition, they are good model systems for the                 study of the physics of biological membranes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \u001a____________________________\u001a                    \u001a____________\u001a                Program Director's Signature                    Date//",
