 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns itself with the electrodynamics of waves and              their interactions in magnetized plasmas.  The proposed research                places emphasis on new approaches and understanding of nonlinear                plasma electrodynamics phenomena associated with coherent versus                chaotic dynamics.  This encompasses three interrelated, major studies:          (1) Chaotic dynamics and diffusion; (2) Wave induced chaos and spatial          diffusion; and (3) Space-time chaos from instability.  The major                objective of the theoretical work of this project is the modeling and           understanding of the above mentioned phenomena as they relate to new            and potentially significant engineering and scientific applications.            These include plasma heating, modification of transport, and control            of instabilities, as for example in energetic plasmas for coherent              electromagnetic sources, in fusion energy research, in ionospheric and          space propagation studies, and in fluid dynamic flows.  Wherever                possible and appropriate, relevant and ongoing experimental work is             used to test and evaluate the analytical results.  The proposed work            seeks to emphasize the advance in our basic understanding of plasma             electrodynamics that may transcend current experiments and                      applications.",
