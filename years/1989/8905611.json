This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support four research                       projects in the Department of Mathematics at Columbia University:               Computational Studies of Automorphic Forms, directed by Isaac                   Efrat, Dorian Goldfeld, Herve Jacquet, Peter Sarnak, and Andrew                 Winkler; Accurate Perturbative Bounds in Dynamical Systems,                     directed by David Rana; Geometric study of Three-Manifolds,                     directed by Craig Hodgson; and Presentations and Fundamental                    Domains for Arithmetic Kleinian Groups, directed by Ted                         Chinburg.",
