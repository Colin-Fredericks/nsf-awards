 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of experimental physics research that will establish a new            technology of light-element fluorescence analysis as the basis for              improved industrial process-control quantitative analysis is proposed.          A successful Phase I project provided evidence that powerful and                efficient techniques for the x-ray fluorescence analysis of low                 atomic-number elements are now made feasible by an innovative                   wavelength-dispersive optical component known as the Layered Synthetic          Microstructure (LSM).  Large-aperture figured LSM x-ray optical                 components will enhance light-element fluorescence signal levels, by            collection and focussing of fluorescent radiation, and will provide             effective wavelength discrimination against continuum background                radiation and competing characteristic emissions.  The challenges of            Phase II research are to develop techniques for construction of                 optimum LSM superlattice structures, to perfect methods for                     supersmoothing of figured optic substrates, and to evaluate                     experimentally the analysis precision, reproducibility and rapidity             provided by the innovation technology.",
