 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AIDS epidemic is among the most critical health crises of                   national and global importance.  While medical science is still                 in the early stages of dealing with the prevention and treatment                of AIDS, social processes carry the responsibility of coping                    constructively with this illness for the foreseeable future.  The               legal system has a paramount role because, as the most pervasive                social institution shaping formal and informal norms, it affects                the meaning of social problems and structures responses to them.                                                                                                This study focuses on how aids disputes emerge, are transformed,                and managed.  The emphasis of the project is on how courts and                  state task forces act on contestations in society over AIDS, how                nascent disputes that never reach public notice are handled, and                how the actions of public institutions transmit messages to                     society about how the disease is to be handled.  To examine these               issues, multiple data sets are used, including all published AIDS               court cases; deliberations and reports from 40 state task forces;               yearly samples of newspapers, mass periodicals, special interest                newsletters, and popular magazines; and in-depth field study of                 full-blown disputes in four cities.                                                                                                                             Given the AIDS epidemic, the research is of great significance                  because it has the goal of discovering just what happens when                   state and legal institutions are presented with claims from                     actors involved in the AIDS health care arena as victims or as                  organizations handling the needs of victims.  Theoretically, the                study draws on work on legal pluralism to discover the role of                  entrenched interests in disputing, on critical legal studies to                 examine linguistic messages and their infusion into public                      discourse, and social movements to identify how stigmatized                     parties resist dominant structures.  Thus, the research should                  advance understanding not only of a current health problem but                  also the legitimation, social control, and change of disputes as                a generic phenomenon.",
