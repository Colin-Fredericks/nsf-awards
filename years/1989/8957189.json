 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves:  (1) Expanding the scope of initial                work in capacity planning to other types of manufacturing systems               such as those with batch processing and assembly; (2) Choice of                 Technology, investment planning in a dynamic environment with the               objective of developing models that examine the trade-offs                      between flexibility and associated costs, and provide a basis for               evaluation of new technologies, especially in CIM and FMS                       systems; and (3) Design of Quality in Manufacturing Systems.                    Traditionally, quality in manufacturing has emphasized                          conformance.  Recent success of Taguchi and related approaches                  suggest that an integrated view that takes into account design,                 manufacturing and market response is likely to be beneficial.                   This research will examine economic and managerial issues                       involved in the design of quality control systems.                                   The research will be directed at developing integrated                     models that examine strategic and design choices in                             manufacturing.  These choices occur within a framework that                     includes policies from other functional disciplines such as                     engineering, product design and marketing.  These concepts have                 been referred to as concurrent Life Cycle Design analysis and                   Design for Manufacturability.  Empirical research suggests that                 these ideas are one of the key factors in the success of Japanese               manufacturers.  Initially the focus will be on the development of               models for performance evaluation and optimization to support                   design decisions.",
