 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key property of the equations governing atmospheric                      motion is their instability relative to small perturbations.                    Fields which are arbitrarily close to each other at some                        initial time evolve during an integration to the point where                    the difference between them (or the \"error\") is as large as the                 difference between two randomly chosen states of the system.                    In numerical weather prediction, uncertainty in the initial                     state grows as the forecast proceeds until details of the                       forecasted weather are no more valid than weather patterns for                  an arbitrarily chosen day.                                                           The objective of this research is to determine the                         sensitivity of a realistic atmospheric model to localized                       errors in the initial conditions.  There are two main areas of                  investigation:  (1) identifying the locations in which the                      errors grow most quickly in short and long range forecasts and                  (2) determining the extent to which a reduction in the initial                  error can extend predictability (the period for which a                         forecast is useful).  The principal investigator will employ a                  simplified version of a global numerical model, developed by                    the National Meteorological Center, to study the relationships                  among the processes of instability, nonlinearity, and latent                    heat release during the course of the forecast.  In addition,                   concepts from dynamical systems theory will be employed in an                   effort to understand the role of scale interactions.",
