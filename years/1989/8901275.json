 "awd_abstract_narration": "The town of Montblanc, located 80 km southwest of Barcelona,                    Spain, traces its roots to a 2nd century A.D. Roman settlement.                 From the Middle Ages onward, it served as a focal point                         funnelling local agricultural goods east to Barcelona and beyond.               Because of its long history, and excellent documentary records,                 located both in Montblanc itself and in other Spanish archives,                 it is possible to reconstruct a detailed history of the town and                observe how it was affected by such major events as the change                  from a feudal to a capitalist form of economy and social                        organization.  One can also determine the spatial correlates of                 such changes through the architectural history of the town itself               and individual houses within it.                                                                                                                                For her doctoral dissertation research, Ms. Patricia Mangan will                trace this interaction from the 14th century to the present.  She               will examine census data from Montblanc, regional maps which                    provide evidence on the spatial relationship of Montblanc to                    neighboring villages, towns and cities, maps of Montblanc's town                plan, extant architectural histories of specific structures and                 other data such as notarial records of births, marriages, wills,                etc.  These will not only provide a detailed picture of one                     limited area within Spain but also yield information of broader                 significance.  Historians and anthropologists cannot agree on                   what factors underlie societal reorganization and change and                    manyhave focussed on the transformation from feudalism to                       capitalism because of the major and basic change this entailed.                 Ms. Mangan's research should provide new insight into this issue.                                                                                                                                                                               Because this work will examine the spatial correlates of social                 change, the results will be of value to a wide range of                         archaeologists.  Excavation often yields spatial information and                the problem then is to use this to reconstruct other aspects of                 society.  Ms. Mangan's research examines just this relationship.",
