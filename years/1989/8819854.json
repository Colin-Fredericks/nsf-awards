 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Bulgaria cooperative mathematics             project between Dr. David Eisenbud of Brandeis University and                     Dr. Luchezar Avramov of the University of Sofia is to jointly                 pursue several problems that lie at the heart of contemporary                   research in algebra and algebraic geometry.  Efforts will address               the theory of free resolutions as a means of deriving invariants of             geometric structures algebraically.  Homological methods will be                used to extend contemporary experience in non-commutative algebra               and general ring theory.  Additionally, the researchers will                    examine the construction of cohomological invariants in relation to             underlaying algebraic variety.  Collectively, results of the new work           should extend present knowledge in a number of related mathematical             fields centering around algebraic geometry and commutative and non-             commutative algebra,  potentially yielding contributions to                     important topics like string theory and topology.                                                                                                               This mathematics project fulfills the program objective of advancing            scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the United                  States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool             resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
