By                      deepening their understanding of mathematics content, changing                  their beliefs and attitudes about mathematics, expanding their                  awareness of applications, and enhancing their teaching                         techniques, it seeks to transform the participants into teachers                who are, and who see themselves as, \"mathematics professionals.\"                During each year of the project, each teacher will attend five                  days of workshops during the academic year and a one-week                       workshop during the summer.  Follow-up will be provided by a                    master teacher who will assist participants in introducing new                  content and implementing new techniques.  In addition, after-                   school meetings and tours of business and industry will be                      arranged.                                                                                                                                                       The school district is contributing in cost-sharing an amount                   equal to 90% of the NSF award.",
