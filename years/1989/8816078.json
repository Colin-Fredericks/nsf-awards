 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, relational databases have emphasized static                      aspects of data.  For instance, data modeling has been done using               just static constraints, and data manipulation has emphasized                   queries over updates.  This was due in part to the nature of                    early database applications, which were mostly business oriented.               Consequently, the relational model has not reflected semantics                  relating to data behaviour.  This feature has been widely                       regarded as a drawback of the relational model, particularly at a               time when new applications have led to increased emphasis in                    conceptual modeling on behavioural aspects of data.  However,                   many basic aspects concerning data behaviour and its connection                 with structure are not well understood.  The primary focus of                   the present proposal is the study of update languages and                       specification methods for behaviour.  A variety of update                       languages are studied and their expressive power characterized.                 One tractable update language of special practical importance,                  called domain-based, is studied in detail with respect to                       optimization, parallelization, and concurrency control.  The                    other languages range over a spectrum of procedural and                         declarative update languages.  Next to update languages and                     specification methods for behaviour, of special concern is the                  connection between behaviour (expressed by valid updates or                     dynamic constraints) and structure (specified in relational                     databases by static constraints).  This will be investigated                    under the present proposal subject to time and resource                         availability.  It is expected that this research will lead to                   better database design methodologies integrating structural and                 behavioural aspects, better means for checking the soundness of a               specification, and a more efficient approach to database                        integrity.  Some of the results will be relevant to adjacent                    areas, such as Programming Languages and Artificial Intelligence.",
