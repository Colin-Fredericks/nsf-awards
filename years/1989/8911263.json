 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every day thousands of individuals stand at the borders of the                  United States and seek to be admitted.  Many are United States                  Citizens returning from vacations or business trips.  Others are                aliens seeking to enter the country.  Should the border inspector               challenge the qualifications of an individual seeking to enter                  the United States, his or her admissibility will be determined in               exclusion proceedings before an Immigration Judge.  These                       decisions are extremely important and affect not only those who                 desire to enter, but also U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and               companies who stand to benefit from the alien's admission.                      Moreover, decisions over the entry of foreign nationals have                    important international implications and are a potential source                 of tension between countries.  Despite its importance and                       concerns about the immense discretionary power delegated to                     immigration government officials, little is known about the                     nature of governmental decisionmaking in controlling the flow of                foreign nationals into the United States.                                                                                                                       This study is an empirical examination of Immigration and                       Naturalization Service and Immigration Judge decisionmaking                     regarding aliens seeking to enter or reenter the United States.                 The major focus for exploration of how national exclusion laws                  and procedures are implemented will be the Chicago, Illinois                    immigration court since it is the second largest in the country                 and conducts several hundred formal exclusion hearings a year.                  Applying the organizational approach to the exclusion                           decisionmaking process, the study will explore three broad areas                of practical and scholarly interest:  (1) the organizational                    environment of the Immigration Service, including its functioning               in relation to the wider administrative, legal and political                    system; (2) the nature of the internal process through which                    Service employees adjudicate applications for admission to the                  U.S.; and (3) the patterns and practices of immigration                         regulation by the Immigration Service and immigration court                     through the use of aggregate data.                                                                                                                              Immigration exclusion laws are one of many interrelated                         mechanisms of social control of foreign nationals by a sovereign                state.  The results of this study will have important policy                    implications as well as contributing significantly to theoretical               knowledge about decisionmaking in a little studied area of the                  law.  In addition, the study will explore the interrelationships                among a variety of state institutions (the Immigration Service,                 immigration court, the State Department, the U.S. Customs Agency,               and U.S. Attorney's Office) and private enterprises (airline                    carriers) that shape decisionmaking.  Consequently, the study                   offers an opportunity to examine some interesting and intricate                 ways in which discretionary decisionmaking by a local entity of a               Federal bureaucracy may be shaped by institutional relationships                and ties operating at both the local and national levels.",
