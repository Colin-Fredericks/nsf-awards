 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed at polymer chain transport at interfaces               and toward interfaces.  By combining with surface light                         scattering studies we have been pursuing in recent years in                     parallel with the chain diffusion studies, we will examine (1)                  polymer lateral diffusion on the interface of air/water(A/W); (2)               adsorption kinetics of polymer chains onto the interfaces of                    air/water and oil/water(O/W); and to extend (3) chain diffusion                 studies to porous media such as thermoreversible and crosslinked                gels.  The first project is derived from our studies for the                    surface viscoelastic parameters of stable spread films of various               polymers on A/W, and thus we will probe into microscopic                        behaviors of chain transport, i.e., lateral diffusion of polymer                chains in monolayers and thin films, and relate them to a                       parameter such as the longitudinal compressional viscosity.  The                second problem is derived from the fact that one gains access to                the adsorption kinetics of polymer chains onto A/W amd O/W by                   non-invasive optical methods of surface light scattering and                    interface evanescent wave fluorescence whereby different                        adsorption mechanisms can be probed directly.  The last item aims               to systematize the chain diffusion behaviors in various gels of                 different pore sizes and network junctions.",
