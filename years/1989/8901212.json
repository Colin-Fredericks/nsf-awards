 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of a species to adapt to local variations in                   habitat is decreased by movement of individuals from one habitat                to another.  However, in a highly mobile insect, the diamond back               moth, local variation in resistance to insecticides occurs.  This               research is designed to determine the source of this variation.                 Is the variation an indication that gene flow (a result of                      individual movement and reproduction in the new habitat) is low                 despite high mobility?  Or is gene flow substantial, but its                    effects overwhelmed by local variation in selection for                         insecticide resistance?  Data will be collected by marking moths                and measuring movement, andy by examining genetic variation                     between populations.  These data will be compared with the use                  of a computer simulation model.                                                      The results of this research will be important in                          understanding how species adapt to variations in their                          environment, and how strongly divided such populations are into                 local, somewhat autonomous groups.  Knowing how gene flow                       affects the ability of insects to respond to environmental                      changes will also help understanding how insects adapt to                       insecticides, and how the evolution of resistance to insecticides               and genetically engineered plants might be managed.",
