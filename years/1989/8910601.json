 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of what is known about the evolution of the U.S. economy is                based on statistical descriptions of the behavior of individual                 aggregate time series or of the relations among key series.  This               project continues and expands previous work on quantifying the                  sources of aggregate fluctuations.  It consists of three parts.                 The first is primarily empirical, and focuses on the role of                    human capital accumulation (learning-by-doing) as a mechanism                   whereby short-run fluctuations have permanent effects.  The                     second is also primarily empirical and concerns the                             predictability of recessions and expansions (as opposed simply to               fluctuations in levels of growth rates) and the implications of                 this predictability for economic theory.  The third is primarily                one of theoretical econometrics and develops techniques for                     inference about orders of integration of time series                            variables.                                                                                                                                                      This project makes important methodological and substantive                     contributions to economics.  The first part of the project                      provides one of the first systematic empirical investigations of                the link between long-run growth and shocks traditionally viewed                as purely temporary such as transitory shifts in monetary policy                or in preferences.  This has important implications for our                     understanding of the sources and the transmission of economic                   fluctuations.  The second part builds on recent joint work aimed                at developing a revised Index of Leading Economic Indicators.                   It could provide better predictions of future recessions and                    expansions.  The third part yields new tools for applying time                  series methods to economic problems.",
