 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Janice Bahr plans to study the regulation of ovulation using the            hen as a model system.  The domestic hen has a unique egg laying                pattern, in that it lays an egg at a later time on sequential days              until the last egg is laid late in the afternoon.  The hen then skips a         day and resets the biological clock so that the first egg of the next           sequence of eggs is laid early in the morning.  The objective of this           continuing research effort is to understand the interplay between the           endocrine system, the brain (biological clock) and the reproductive             system that gives rise to this unique pattern.  The focus of the work           is on factors controlling the action of the ovulation inducing hormone,         LH, (produced by the pituitary) on the regulation of progesterone               production in the granulosa cells in the wall of the follicle.                  Progesterone surges trigger ovulation from the follicle; therefore, the         regulation of progesterone synthesis from estrogens and androgens in            these cells is critical in the regulation of ovulation.  LH production          by the pituitary is regulated by both blood levels of progesterone and          estrogen and by releasing factors that are under the control of the             hypothalamus (brain).  The results are of prime importance to our               understanding of the control of ovulation in vertebrate species.",
