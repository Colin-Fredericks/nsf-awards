 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research comprises an experimental and analytical                          investigation of semi active dampers, a special class of                        nonlinear, controllable damping actuators for vibration isolation               and disturbance rejection applications.  The potential                          application areas for semi active damping technology include                    rotating and impact machinery, manipulators, bearing dampers,                   vehicle suspensions, prosthetics, space structures, and reaction                mass devices.  Dampers can be one of three types, active,                       passive, or semi active.  The first is characterized by power                   input devices activated by a feedback signal and by power                       dissipation, the second by power dissipation only, and the third                by power dissipation but also by some of the same active features               as the active damper.  Preliminary studies show that the semi                   active class performs nearly as well as the more complex, more                  expensive, higher power, and higher response time fully active                  dampers.  The research is a three phase effort, including a                     theoretical analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of the damper                    actuator, the development of control concepts for various                       vibration applications of this class of dampers, and design,                    fabrication and study of a prototype damper.",
