 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces microprocessor controlled and computer                  interfaced instrumentation and equipment into analytical, organic and           general chemistry laboratory courses at Trident Technical College.              These courses benefit both the Chemical Engineering and the Medical             Laboratory Technology students as well as the students enrolled in the          Associate in Science degree program.  Major instrumentation purchased           include a uv/visible scanning spectrophotometer, a gas chromatograph,           PH meters, an atomic absorption spectrometer, and a constant                    temperature bath-circulator.  This modern computer-based                        instrumentation is essential for educating students embarking on                careers in modern chemistry, chemical engineering technology and                related fields.  This award is being matched by an equal amount from            the principal investigator's institution.",
