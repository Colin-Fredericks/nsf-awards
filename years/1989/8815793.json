 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. Stuart L. Shapiro and colleagues of                Cornell University to collaborate with Prof. Humitaka Sato of Kyoto             University, Japan, and co-workers over a period of two years.  They             will investigate certain leading-edge problems in relativity and                relativistic astrophysics, including the nature of gravitational                collapse, the formation of black holes, and the generation of gravity           waves.  The emphasis of this work will be on the application of                 supercomputers to these problems.                                                                                                                               The purpose of this research is to enhance our understanding of both            relativity and cosmology, by bringing together two of the leading               groups in the field. Both groups have done pioneering research in               these fields and share an interest in the application of supercomputers         to these problems.  The program of regular visits and collaborative             investigations to be supported by this grant will combine the                   expertise of the groups.  Appropriate supercomputer facilities are              available both in Kyoto and at the Cornell National Supercomputer               Facility, and will be applied to such problems as the nature of mass            singularities leading to black holes; the nature of nonspherical                gravitational collapse; and cosmology of the early universe.  Each              group has developed its own algorithms for computational simulation             of relevant phenomena, and programming techniques and results will be           compared.",
