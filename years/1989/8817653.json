 "awd_abstract_narration": "They will continue the study of interfaces which divide co-                     existing phases of material, with the first two parts directed                  toward well defined and immediate goals.  In the last part they                 propose problems which would require more time and thought, but                 applicable in a broader context of physics.                                                                                                                     (A) In an on-going exploration of systems with anisotropy, this                 part deals with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium crystal                    shapes.  In particular, they will extend the study of effects of                external forces (e.g., gravity) to include other types of fields                and in three dimensions.  For non-equilibria, they intend to                    investigate droplet shapes in a driven lattice gas system.                      (B) Within the context of dynamics, the interplay between bulk                  and interface fluctuations will be explored.                                    (C) The long-term projects concern dynamics at first order                      transitions, effects of external forces on surface tension, and                 inclusion of curvature, torsion and Chern-Simons terms in studies               of geometric objects beyond interfaces.",
