 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Brian Hesse and Paula Wapnish will combine field and                       laboratory research in Israel and the United States to study the                changes in animal utilization between ca. 1500 and 600 BC.  A                   series of five stratified urban sites - Ashkelon, Tel Batash,                   Tell Jemmeh, Tel Miqne, and Tel Qasile - all located in southern                Canaan span this time interval, and careful excavations are                     providing large well provenienced faunal samples.  The                          investigators will identify remains to a species level, determine               the minimum numbers of individuals represented, and the ages at                 which animals were slaughtered.  Through radiographic analysis of               bone, they hope to determine whether animals such as cattle were                used for draft or consumption and, in the latter case, whether                  they were raised primarily for meat or milk.  Finally,                          examination of differential representation of individual skeletal               elements and breakage patterns of each will permit reconstruction               of butchering practices.                                                                                                                                        This analysis will provide important insights into how complex                  economic systems developed in the Old World and how these were                  influenced by political change.  Animals were an important                      component of the economies of the ancient world, and as political               fortunes shifted between periods of disaggregation and                          centralization, so too did the social institutions that managed                 production and consumption switch between independence and                      integration.  Superimposed on the environmental framework within                which herdsmen made their decisions, socio-political forces acted               to influence the choices made by individual animal husbanders and               households.  In the ancient eastern Mediterranean, four supra-                  household institutions had an impact on animal production and                   use:  the market, the ritual center, the taxation/tribute system,               and the relations between the agricultural and pastoral sectors                 of society.  All four of these have been identified in                          ethnographic and historical models of culture change and linked                 with faunally measurable variables.  During the period under                    study (1500 to 600 BC), this region underwent several major well                documented political changes, and the study by Drs. Hesse and                   Wapnish should reveal the economic effects of these.                                                                                                            This research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                 increase our understanding of how complex societies, such as our                own, are developed and maintained.  Secondly, the models of                     economic organization which emerge will provide direct insight                  into how more traditional Middle Eastern economies function at                  the present time.",
