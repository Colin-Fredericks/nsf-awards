 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative study between the University of Colorado                and the University of North Carolina on the Nd, Sr, and Pb                      isotopic, and trace element compositions of Cenozoic mafic-to-                  silicic volcanic rocks in the Mojave Desert region of                           southeastern California.  The study will use temporal and spatial               variations in the geochemical characteristics of the volcanic                   rocks to constrain models of the tectonic evolution of this                     region, and to study aspects of the magmatic evolution of the                   Cenozoic volcanic rocks.  Geochemical data from <5Ma basalts will               be used to evaluate the age, structure, and composition of the                  mantle currently underlying this area.  The results of this study               will be used to test whether pre-Cenozoic mantle lithosphere has                been tectonically removed from beneath the continental crust, as                suggested by available isotopic data and as proposed in some                    tectonic models for this region.  Geochemical data from older                   Cenozoic basalts will be used to assess the tectonic setting in                 which lithosphere removal took place.  A similar geochemical data               set will be obtained for Miocene intermediate-to-silicic                        volcanics and will be used to constrain models for the genesis of               these rocks.  The isotopic compositions of these rocks will also                be used to infer aspects of the geochemistry of the lower                       continental crust, and to define any subsurface boundaries                      between Precambrian basement terraines with different Nd isotopic               characteristics.  Overall this study will represent the first                   comprehensive characterization of the isotope and trace element                 compositions of Mojave volcanic rocks, and one of the first                     attempts to apply such data towards constraining tectonic models                of the continental lithosphere.  The study represents an                        outgrowth from previous NSF supported research by both of the                   PIs.  Glazner (UNC) will be responsible for sample selection,                   petrography and trace-element chemistry, and Farmer (UC) will                   carry out all isotopic determinations.",
