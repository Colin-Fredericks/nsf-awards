 "awd_abstract_narration": "Machining is the largest single application of lasers to                        materials processing.  Laser cutting of metallic materials is                   finding increasing use in industrial applications but is                        generally limited to thin sections (less than 5 mm).  Thicker-                  section metal cutting with lasers suffers from several drawbacks                that include lack of heat penetration, large kerf width, poor cut               quality, and problems associated with material removal and heat                 transfer.                                                                                                                                                       A thermochemical approach involving the application of two                      adjacent, high-power laser beams in Gaussian energy configuration               and various organic assist gases (C2 H2, C3 H8, and C7 H18) along               with oxygen will be investigated with a view to extending the                   performance limitations of laser cutting without deteriorating                  the cut quality.  Heat transfer, fluid flow, and chemical                       reaction phenomena will be considered in developing theoretical                 models that will closely predict the experimental results.  The                 mathematical approach combined with the proposed experiments will               provide valuable insight into the nature of physical phenomena,                 facilitating efficient laser cutting of materials much thicker                  and at speeds faster than those that are possible currently.  The               proposed research will be particularly relevant to high-                        technology manufacturing industries that use laser machining.",
