 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marron lobster, Cherax tenuimanus, a freshwater lobster or                      crayfish indigenous to southwest Australia, is a promising new                  species for U.S. aquaculture.  It looks and tastes like American                lobster and grows in pond culture feeding on detrital organisms.                Results from Phase I indicate that marron aquaculture may be                    feasible in the U.S.  During Phase I of this project, it was                    demonstrated that marron grow at rates equal or greater than                    those reported in Australia; evidence of reproduction was                       observed; marron shipping methods were perfected; and key water                 temperature and quality parameters for marron aquaculture were                  identified.  During the two-year Phase II, it is proposed to                    conduct the following activities to prepare for commercializa-                  tion:  (1) examine marron growout and refine marron aquaculture                 production techniques under commercial pilot-scale conditions at                two sites in ponds and tanks; (2) continue experimental growout,                survival, and density work at Auburn University; (3) conduct                    physiological, nutritional, and pathological studies; (4) examine               marron through one or two reproductive cycles; and (5) complete a               financial feasibility analysis in preparation for commercializa-                tion.",
