 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Career Advancement Award supported under the Research                 Opportunities for Women Program and the Economics Program.  The                 broad purpose of this type of award is to enable promising women                scholars to increase their research productivity.  With this                    award, the investigator will pursue three areas of research.  The               first will involve the refinement of measures of labor quality,                 to more accurately reflect the impact of changes in the                         composition of the labor force, thereby improving estimates of                  economic growth.  The second, a related area of research, will                  also be directed at improving the measurement of economic growth                by including the valuation of nonmarket activities that takes                   into account the loss in lifetime earnings due to interruptions                 of labor force activity for child rearing.  The third area of                   research will focus on analyzing the factors that give rise to a                comparative advantage in computer-hardware manufacturing.  Since                computers are a vital component in the acceleration of technical                progress, it is important to understand what gives rise to                      comparative advantage in their manufacture.",
