 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses the effect of income support, in the                       form of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), on                      the poverty of children in single-parent families.  The                         Principal Investigator draws on a large, longitudinal data                      set (the Panel Study of Income Dynamics), collected over                        twenty-one years, to test the hypothesis that generous                          welfare benefits undermine the work ethic of recipients and                     thereby contribute to the growth of an underclass in the                        United States.  Since the AFDC guarantee (the amount of money                   paid to single-parent families with no other source of                          income) varies by state and within states over time, this                       research can investigate whether higher AFDC guarantees                         ameliorate or perpetuate poverty, and the conditions under                      which either outcome is likely.  The findings from this study                   can contribute information as to the optimal level for                          welfare benefits.  It can also shed light on an issue of                        vital concern among policy makers, that higher welfare                          benefit levels may hurt rather than help the poor in the long                   run.",
