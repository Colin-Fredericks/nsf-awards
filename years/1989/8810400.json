 "awd_abstract_narration": "The control of cellular behaviors such as cell migration, axon                  guidance and synaptogenesis is critical to nervous system                       development.  To understand the molecular basis for this control,               it is essential to identify the molecules that are involved.                    Proteoglycans comprise a class of glycoproteins long suspected to               play key roles in the morphogenetic behaviors of cells. Evidence                that proteoglycans are particularly important to neural                         development is considerable, but largely either indirect or                     circumstantial.  Advances in this area have been slow because                   proteoglycan fractionation and analysis have traditionally been                 difficult.  Recently, however, these methods have been improved                 considerably, making it possible to obtain tools with which to                  assess the functions of nervous system proteoglycans directly.                  As a first step toward this end, proteoglycans will be isolated                 from developing neural tissue (fetal rat brain, cultured neurons)               and characterized by the size of their protein cores, the class                 of glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins of the nervous system.                    Monoclonal antibodies reacting with some of these proteoglycans                 will be identified.  As a result, it will be possible to identify               particular proteoglycans whose temporal expression, spatial                     distribution, or binding specificities are consistent with                      particular roles in neural development.",
