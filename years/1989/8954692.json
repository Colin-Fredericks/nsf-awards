 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to measure learning in science and mathematics,                   the Connecticut State Department of Education, in collaboration                 with 7 other states and the Coalition of Essential Schools (a                   network of schools dedicated to innovative learning of a common                 core curriculum in science, mathematics, and the humanities)                    proposes to develop appropriate assessments in science and                      mathematics that transcend mere multiple-choice tests. These                    will consist of complex situations that measure students'                       knowledge and understanding, as well as necessary skills and                    competencies. These \"performance-based assessments\" will employ                 collaborative learning, and involve the design and execution of                 field and laboratory investigations. The collection, analysis,                  interpretation, and clear reporting of data will be an                          essential part of the assessments. Some of the problems to be                   solved will require a short amount of time, while others may                    last a month or more. The development of this program will take                 31 months, and will include the participation of knowledgeable                  individuals (both content experts and exemplary classroom                       teachers) from CT, MI, MN, NY, TX, VT, and WI. The CT                           assessment will be administered to a statewide sample in the                    spring of 1991.                                                                                                                                                      The bases of the assessments of the CT common core of                      essential learning standards include a number of national                       recommendations (NCTM, 2061, MSEB, NSTA and so on. The                          assessment tasks will be designed to represent active learning                  and which include divergent as well as convergent thinking. The                 tasks will also be designed to be as useful for instruction as                  assessment and serve as a catalyst for the learning valued in                   CT and the national recommendations from the content-focused                    reports mentioned above. The final goal of the project is to                    determine if such assessments and the evidence they generate                    can be aggregated into meaningful summaries for state                           accountability purposes.                                                                                                                                             Amount of Award over 45 months $997,956 (reduced from                      original request of $1.6 million over 31 months) - initial FY89                 funds award $500,000.
