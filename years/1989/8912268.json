 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between U.S. and                 Belgian scientists in the area of development and characterization              of conjugated polymers.  The U.S. investigators are Drs. A.J.                   Heeger and Fred Wudl, University of California, Santa Barbara.  The             Belgian collaborator is Professor Jean-Luc Bredas, University of                Mons.                                                                                                                                                           The joint project will focus on the following three topics:                     1) development and characterization of new polymer materials with               small band gaps (2) evaluation of the electronic properties of                  soluble conducting polymers and (3) the role of charged nonlinear               excitations (solitons, polarons and bipolarons) in the nonlinear                optical properties of conjugated polymers.  The investigators have              a history of successful collaboration, based on their complementary             expertise.  Dr. Bredas has a background in quantum chemistry and                has made outstanding contributions to the theory of quasi-one-                  dimensional solids and in particular to conducting polymers.                                                                                                    The U.S. researchers have carried out leading experimental                      investigations in the area of highly conducting organic solids.                 The results of the proposed project will contribute to increased                understanding of this important area of materials research, which               has many potential industrial applications.",
