 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science Department at Eastern Michigan                        University equipped a lecture auditorium for its Basic Studies                  Computer Science course with computer and state-of-the-art                      peripheral equipment.  This course is designed specifically for                 non-computer science majors.  This funding support changed the                  traditional lecture format to include direct student-computer                   interactions during class time.  Student experiments in class are               particularly effective in a large lecture session because the                   faculty can exploit the computational capabilities of the                       computer in real time.  The goal of this project is to target                   each classroom experiment to a specific concept, principle or                   effect of computers.  To this end the project combines                          microcomputers and audio and video components with the necessary                projection devices into an integrated instructional unit.                                                                                                       This award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               investigator's institution.",
