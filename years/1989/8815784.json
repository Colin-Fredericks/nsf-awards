 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuing investigation of the thermodynamics of polymer                  blends will be based on inverse gas chromatography (IGC).  The                  technique of IGC was perfected and brought to an acceptable                     level of accuracy in research under NSF grant DMR-8414575.                      Polymer-polymer interaction coefficients, very difficult to                     obtain by other methods, will be measured for several compatible                blends.  Interaction coefficients of incompatible polymers will                 be studied using random copolymers composed of the same monomeric               units as those in the incompatible polymers.  Interactions                      between polymer segments are determined by the same factors that                determine polymer-solvent interactions.  The latter interactions                are convieniently obtained by IGC on homopolymers.  A large                     number of interaction coefficients will be measured on blends,                  copolymers, and homopolymers and the data analyzed to yield the                 individual effects important to mixing:  contact interactions,                  specific interactions, equation of state effects, and molecular                 packing.  The experimental base will be expanded by measuring                   relevant data on low-molecular-weight mixtures; calorimetry,                    light scattering, and densitometry will be used.  The ultimate                  goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of mixing of polymeric                systems which is capable of predicting polymer solubility and                   compatibility in blends.",
