 "awd_abstract_narration": "The XXII Interamerican Congress of Psychology to be held in                     Buenos Aires, Argentina, June 25-30, 1989 will provide an                       opportunity for US and Latin American psychologists to discuss                  research ongoing in all areas of psychology.  Partial travel                    support will be provided for a small number of American                         participants.                                                                                                                                                   Encompassing all aspects of the discipline of psychology, The                   Interamerican Congresses of Psychology, sponsored every two years               by the Interamerican Society of Psychology (SIP), have since 1953               been the single most important forum for exchange among                         psychologists and other behavioral scientists in the western                    hemisphere concerned with the comparative and cross-cultural                    aspects of human behavior.                                                                                                                                      The program will feature 52 invited speakers, including many                    eminent US scientists, along with over 1800 other scientific                    presentations in symposia, literature reviews, poster sessions,                 and roundtables.                                                                                                                                                The outcome of this meeting, as with previous Congresses, will be               increased collaboration between US and Latin American scientists,               particularly on cross-cultural issues, and a positive influence                 on experimental behavioral research in Latin America.",
