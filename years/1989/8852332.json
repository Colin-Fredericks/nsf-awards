 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymer properties, such as molecular weight and copolymer                      composition, are highly dependent on the process conditions under               which they are made.  The enhancement in understanding of the                   underlying concepts by undergraduate chemists and chemical                      engineers in the interdisciplinary field of polymer science is                  needed.  This is to be accomplished by the coupling of reaction                 simulators with experimental design, reactor operation and                      process measurement.  The equipment is specific for this purpose:               1)  microcomputers for simulator development and studies; 2)                    computer controlled laboratory reactor for metering reactants and               controlling, monitoring and recording reaction conditions; and 3)               monomer/polymer monitoring equipment for determining conversion.                                                                                                Traditional polymer lab courses barely touch on the decision                    making processes behind the synthesis of various polymers and                   then only in a qualitative manner.  In addition, the importance                 of monitoring and controlling the process is typically                          overshadowed by the need to measure the polymer properties.                     These are highly interdependent and of equal importance.  An                    undergraduate's experience in both areas is necessary                           particularly with the increasing importance placed on                           communication between the bench chemist and the plant engineer.",
