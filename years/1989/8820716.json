The workshop will focus on recent developments in ergodic                theory and symbolic dynamics and will include the theories of                   restricted orbit equivalence and joinings as unifying themes in                 measurable ergodic theory, measurable and algebraic actions of                  certain groups, applications of symbolic dynamics to data                       transmission and storage and to the spectra of nonnegative                      matrices, and work relating complex analytic dynamics and                       automorphisms of symbolic systems.                                                   Ergodic theory has its origins in statistical and celestial                mechanics and has since grown in many directions, drawing                       strength from subjects as diverse as Lie groups and number                      theory, while contributing to many other mathematical                           disciplines.  There have been many interactions discovered                      between ergodic theory and symbolic dynamics.",
