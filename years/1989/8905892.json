 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment grant proposal is intended to support power electronics          research at the University of Toledo.  Power electronics is a rapidly-          growing electrical-engineering specialty area which deals with                  electronic circuits capable of efficiently processing electrical                energy at high power levels.                                                                                                                                    Two research projects to be supported are the high-power-factor                 rectifier and high-power switching converters suitable for application          in space (such as NASA's space station).                                                                                                                        Rectifiers convert AC power from the utility distribution system into           DC power for use by computers, variable-speed motors and other                  electronic equipment.  However, simple rectifiers draw relatively               large currents for the amount of power being processed.  This research          seeks advanced circuit designs which draw lower AC line currents for            equal amounts of power.                                                                                                                                         NASA's space station will initially use a 100 kilowatt power                    distribution system.  This will require electronic converters to raise          or lower DC voltage levels, or convert DC to AC power.  The                     researchers at the University of Toledo are looking for electronic              converters which can perform unattended for long periods of time in             the hostile environment of outer-space.  The equipment requested meets          the specialized measurement and testing needs of these research                 projects.",
