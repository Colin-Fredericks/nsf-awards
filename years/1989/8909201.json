 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with a critical, but inadequately studied, feature          of representative democracy in the United States:  the election of              members of the U.S. Congress, state legislatures, and numerous city             councils and county legislatures in district-based electoral systems.           Indeed, all but two democratic nations elect national legislatures in           single member or multimember geographic-based districts.                                                                                                        This project is aimed at assessing the consequences of district-based           representation.  The most obvious consequence in American elections is          political gerrymandering, where one party attempts to redraw the                district lines so that the underlying electoral system favors one               political party over the other.  Redistricting can also increase or             decrease the electoral responsiveness of an electoral system - - the            degree to which the division of parties in a legislature responds to            changes in voter preferences.                                                                                                                                   Unfortunately, although numerous scholars have assessed the impact of           redistricting on a political system through simple means, it is                 difficult to determine its effect on the more fundamental aspects of            American politics such as partisan bias and electoral responsiveness by         casual inspection of voting results.  Indeed, even the Supreme Court            has recognized this difficult methodological problem.  In Davis v.              Bandemer (106 S.Ct. 2797. 1986), the court declared political                   gerrymandering justiceable for the first time.  However, the justices           could agree on neither the acceptable measures of political                     gerrymandering nor the requisite standards for democratic                       representation.                                                                                                                                                 This investigation will enable the investigator to continue the                 substantial program of research he has begun in this area.  The general         strategy is to contribute to political science research by developing a         series of mathematical and statistical models of district-based                 representation.  The research began at the most aggregated level, the           nationwide translation of votes into seats, and mapped broad patterns           in American electoral systems.  This research now moves toward                  progressively more micro-levels to find what political phenomena give           rise to these broad patterns.  These levels of analysis include the             district-level translation from votes to seats, a district level model          with incumbents and challengers analytically removed, a model of                drawing district lines around geographically located voters, and,               finally, studying the geographic distribution of partisans and                  individual voting behavior.",
