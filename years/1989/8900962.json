 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to understand the dip and                 curvature of the subducting plate, the velocity structure of the                overlying accretionary complex and the configuration of the                     boundary between the subducting plate, the accretionary complex                 and the overriding accreted terrane for the Oregon margin.                      Program involves the emplacement of an array of ocean bottom                    seismometers offshore and an array of receivers on shore to                     record during one day of shooting from a high volume air gun                    array on a chartered commercial seismic vessel.  The one day                    refraction program is being added to an already funded high                     resolution multi-channel reflectiion survey in the area.                        %%%                                                                                  The deep structure of active continental margins is of                     considerable scientific interest.  The Oregon margin is of                      particular interest because there is great interest in the                      seismic hazard of this region, and understanding of the shape,                  characteristics, and depth of the subducting plate will help                    earth quake seismologists to identify that part of the boundary                 which is most likely to sustain earthquakes.  Dr. Trehu is a                    leader in the field of seismic refraction, especially using ocean               bottom recorders.  She has successfully carried out similar                     experiments in the Great Lakes and on the California margin.",
