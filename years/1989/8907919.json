 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific progress is a multifaceted process, involving                        experimentation, observation, theory, publishing, informal                      discussions, and formal meetings.  The current proposal seeks                   support for the latter of these activities, namely for the                      \"Sixth Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems and                    the Sun,\" September 12-14, 1989, to be held at the University                   of Washington, Seattle.  The focus of this workshop will be on                  the \"solar-stellar connection,\" which is a relatively new,                      interdisciplinary research area that brings together the fields                 of solar physics and stellar atmospheres of late type stars.                    Particular topics of these fields are stellar coronae,                          chromospheres, winds, flares, magnetic fields, convection, and                  non-radiative heating processes.                                                                                                                                The main emphasis of the present workshop will be on stellar                    mass loss and evolution.  U.S. and foreign researchers will be                  attending, as well as graduate students.  This workshop                         continues a tradition that started with a workshop on cool                      stars in Cambridge in 1980 and that has become the focal point                  in the field of solar-stellar research.",
