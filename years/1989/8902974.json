 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of a model for the use of data on accident precursors           or \"near misses\" will be investigated in estimating the frequencies of          rare events.  In particular, this work will focus on the application            of the proposed framework in cases where the available data (i.e., the          observed precursors or near misses) are subject to widely divergent             interpretations by the experts, and as a result expert opinion                  provides relatively little guidance to decision makers.  The results            of this work will:  (1) provide a formal procedure for the use of               accident precursor data in estimating event frequencies; and (2) aid            decision makers in evaluating the credibility of expert                         interpretations of accident precursors.                                                                                                                         Interactive activities include giving lectures in several senior                undergraduate and graduate-level courses on risk analysis and                   reliability engineering, participating in the weekly seminar series of          the Department of Chemical and Nuclear Engineering, with particular             emphasis on inviting other women engineers and scientists as speakers,          and with the faculty advisor for the student chapter of the American            Nuclear Society, which has a large female membership, and with the              local student chapter of the Society of Women Engineers.                                                                                                        This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and  (2) to encourage               women to pursue careers in sience and engineering by providing greater          visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
