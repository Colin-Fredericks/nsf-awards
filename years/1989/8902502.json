This                       conference is primarily concerned with the biology and                          molecular biology of genetic exchange systems in a variety of                   procaryotic and eucaryotic systems, and is the major annually                   occurring meeting devoted to this subject area                                  internationally.  One significant feature of these meetings                     is their accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral                   students, whose travel funds frequently are limited.                            Specifically to address this problem, we request funds to                       provide travel and support scholarships to facilitate the                       attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral students                      working in various areas of genetic exchange and related                        subject areas.  The amount requested is $6,000.  Corporate                      funds are also solicited to provide expenses for 2-3                            distinguished scientists as plenary speakers.",
