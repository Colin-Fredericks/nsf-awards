 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most essential issues in a shared memory multiprocessor              system isthe so called memory latency that includes both the main               memory access timeand the interconnection network (IN) contention.  The         introduction of cachememory into parallel computers has been widely             accepted as an efficient way ofimproving the system performance.                However, multicaches create a cachecoherence problem which must be              solved in order for a computer to workcorrectly.  Traditional solution          techniques for the cache coherence problem inshared memory                      multiprocessor systems have a potential bottleneck problem                      whichsignificantly restricted the scalability of multiprocessor                 systems.  This pasresearch project investigates new distributed cache           coherence protocols basedon high bandwidth, packet.switched                     multiple.bus INs.  Two configurations ofthe multiple.bus will be                considered in this research:  hierarchicalstructures of buses and               homogeneous single.level multiple buses.  It alsoinvestigates                   analytical models for the cache protocols based on the twostructures to         show the performance improvement of the new protocols.  Theresearch             thus involves (a) study of the correctness and efficiency of the                newprotocols; (b) development of analytical models for the systems;             (c)performance comparison of the two structures based on different              applicationsoftwares; (d) examination of the effects of system                  parameters on the systemperformance including number of buses, cache            block size, number of levels in ahierarchy, and number of modules               connected to a bus at each level.",
