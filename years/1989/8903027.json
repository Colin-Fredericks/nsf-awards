 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Allen will initiate a new program of researching                 in gravitation and cosmology.  This will explore two different                  models of the early universe, to see what they predict about the                universe today.                                                                      The \"inflationary\" model convincingly accounts for the great               size and uniformity of our present-day universe.  He will study                 the production of primordial gravity-waves in this model.  To do                so, he will resolve some difficulties that have arisen in the                   treatment of gravitons (the quanta that transmit gravitational                  forces) in de Sitter space, and understand how quantum effects                  can influence the physical stability of this model.                                  The \"cosmic string\" model can account for the temperature                  fluctuations expected to occur in the microwave background                      radiation.  He is constructing a computer simulation of the                     motion of loops of \"cosmic string\" which are supposed to cause                  galaxies to form in the model.  He will study the distribution of               these model galaxies in space and compare it with what                          astronomers observe in the sky.                                                      Finally, he will use a new mathematical formalism invented                 by Vilkovisky and DeWitt for calculating quantum effects.  The                  goal is to understand how the results of this method differ from                standard techniques currently in use, and to see if they change                 the predictions about gravity-wave production in the inflationary               model.",
