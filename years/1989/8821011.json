 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on the                                 reduction of fire risk from earthquake-generated                                tsunamis (large waves) to be conducted by Jane and                              Rolf Preuss of Urban Regional Research in Seattle,                              Washington and Julio Kuroiwa of the National                                    University of Engineering of Peru.  First, the                                  vulnerability to ignition of fuel sources in the port                           of Callao will be analyzed and correlated in terms of                           fire spread with the population and greater area of                             the port.  The emphasis will be on gross damage                                 potential rather than monetary loss.  Then, a risk                              management program will be developed which will                                 combine risk mitigation and emergency preparedness                              measures.                                                                                                                                                       The Peruvian team will have the responsibility for                              data collection and public coordination.  Urban                                 Regional Research will assist technically in the                                preparation of alternative plans, evaluation                                    techniques and preparation of the detailed site                                 plans.  While Lima is the case study area, there are                            many comparable U.S. ports with similar potential for                           risk such as Anchorage, Alaska, badly damaged in                                1964.  Methodologies for defining and responding to                             risk will aid both countries even when fire and                                 contamination are not caused by tsunamis.",
