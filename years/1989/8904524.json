Aseismic hybrid protective system consists of                                   a combination of a base isolation system and                                    small active control devices which is most                                      suitable for tall buildings.  While many                                        studies have been carried out separately in                                     each area of base isolation system and active                                   control system, there are serious limitations                                   for each individual applications.  A hybrid                                     system can be used advantageously to ensure                                     the structural integrity of seismic-excited                                     tall buildings.                                                                                                                                                 Theoretical studies will be carried out at                                      GWU for various combinations and                                                configurations of hybrid systems, including                                     different base isolation systems and                                            different small active control devices.                                         Experimental tests will be conducted at HACEI                                   on a scaled model structure mounted on                                          different types of base isolation systems and                                   implemented by small active control devices.                                    Various contol algorithms developed for                                         hybrid systems will be used.  Results of                                        experimental tests will be correlated with                                      the corresponding analytical/numerical                                          solutions.  Discrepancies in the correlation                                    as well as physical and practical limitations                                   in system design and instrumentation will be                                    investigated.                                                                                                                                                   This research has the potential to provide an                                   effective engineering seismic protection                                        system for tall buildings and large                                             structures.",
