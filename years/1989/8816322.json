 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosynthesis is of fundamental importance as a biological process and         it is important to understand its mechanism, and control by factors             within the plant and in the environment.  Plants take up carbon dioxide         from the atmosphere and assimilate it into organic phosphates which are         used for synthesizing starch, sucrose, amino acids, etc.  A limited             number of higher plants, including maize (corn), have evolved a                 mechanism for concentrating carbon dioxide in their leaves so that the          low concentration in the air (0.034%) does not limit their ability to           perform photosynthesis.  This mechanism involves a biochemical pathway          called the C.4 cycle, and such plants are called C.4 plants.                                                                                                    C..4 plants achieve very high rates of photosynthesis under high                temperature and light intensities.  However, in many C.4 plants,                photosynthesis is quite sensitive to moderately low temperatures (i.e.          10 to 15.oC while a few species or races are more tolerant.  In this            project, sensitivity to low temperature will be examined relative to            processes associated with the C.4 cycle (transport of organic compounds         and function of proteins as catalysts of reactions).  Factors which             protect the processes under low temperatures will be examined in C.4            plants which are chilling tolerant.  Basic knowledge gained from these          studies will be of value in exploiting the mechanism of C.4                     photosythesis so that it can be used on a larger scale in production of         food, biomass and in urban applications.",
