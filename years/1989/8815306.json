The objective of this research is to further                our understanding of the interaction of radiation with matter.                                                                                                  In this joint project, both theoretical and experimental studies                will be undertaken to examine the response of an ensemble of atoms              to two or more radiation fields.  Research will focus on the                    sensitivity of the atomic response to the coherence properties of               the applied fields and to collisional processes occurring in the                atomic vapor.  Specific goals of the research program are:  (1) a               experimental and theoretical study of the interaction of intense                stochastic fields with atoms; (2) a unified approach to explain                 various collision-induced resonant structures that appear in                    nonlinear spectroscopic line shapes; (3) a theoretical and                      experimental study of new situations in which collision-induced                 resonances are observed; and (4) a fully-quantized theory of                    multiple-wave interactions of radiation with matter.  This work                 will bring together three institutions with significant expertise               in the theoretical and experimental studies of atomic and optical               physics.",
