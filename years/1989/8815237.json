 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbial extracellular polysaccharides are ubiquitous in                  the epilithon covering submerged lotic surfaces, yet their                      significance to carbon transfer in these ecosystems is unknown.                 The proposed research will estimate production of bacterial and                 algal biomass and the production of microbial extracellular                     polysaccharide on wood substrates in the Ogeechee River, a sixth                order blackwater river, and measure the efficiency with which                   extracellular polysccharide may be assimilated by nymphal                       ayflies and by oligochaets.  Assimilation of extracellular                      polysaccharide will be determined by feeding studies using 14C                  labelled extracellular polysaccharides.  These polysaccharides                  will be purified form cultures of slime-producing bacteria which                have been isolated from wood submerged in the Ogeechee River.                   Oak dowels in stream-side flumes will be used as subtrates for                  microbial colonization.                                                              If extracellular polysaccharides are assimilated by                        freshwater invertebrates, the contribution of microbes to                       invertebrate productivity would be much greater than suggested by               estimates of cellular consumption alone.  The assimilation of                   these products of microbial metabolism may contribute to meeting                detritivore carbon requirements in many aquatic habitats where                  cellular microbial biomass is insufficient to meet detritivore                  needs.                                                                               This research should be of significant basic ecological                    interest and produce results with meaning for stream management.                The student's mentor is an excellent scientist, and institutional               accommodations are good.                                                             The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends support for this                  doctoral dissertation improvement project.",
