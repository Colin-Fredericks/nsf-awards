 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glacial-Holocene changes in bottom water temperature will be                    calculated by measuring changes in the rate of amino acid                       diagenesis (isoleucine epimerization) in radiocarbon dated,                     planktonic foraminifera from equatorial Atlantic, Pacific and                   Indian Ocean cores.  The extent of epimerization in a sample                    is a function of the time elapsed, and the integrated thermal                   history, since death of the organism.  By constraining                          the age of our samples using existing accelerator mass                          spectrometry (AMS) 14c dated core samples, we will obtain                       precise determinations of epimerization reaction rates.  The                    temperature dependence of the reaction for individual taxa                      will be calibrated by laboratory heating experiments and by                     analysis of Holocene samples from the major ocean basins, and                   from marginal seas where the bottom water temperatures are                      elevated.                                                                                                                                                       The results of the study will, for the first time, provide                      a measurement of bottom water temperature that is                               independent of an analysis of the oxygen isotope record. This                   will contribute to an improved understanding of the 180 record,                 allowing us to explicitly calculate ice volume (sea level)                                                                                                      and watermass salinity values, and to test theories calling                                                                                                     for changes in bottom water temperature during the last                                                                                                         glacial cycle, or for floating ice shelves in the northern                                                                                                      and/or southern hemispheres.                                                                                                                                    %%%                                                                                                                                                             This project will determine the change in the temperature of                                                                                                    bottom-water in the worlds ocean from the peak of the last                                                                                                      ice age to present.
