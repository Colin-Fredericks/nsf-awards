This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support three projects in the               Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann                     Arbor: Multivariate Statistical Analysis, directed by Robb                      Muirhead; Sequential Design and Analysis, directed by Janis                     Hardwick, Robert Keener, and Michael Woodroofe; and Bandwidth                   Selection for Smooth Estimation of Statistical Functionals,                     directed by Julian Faraway.",
