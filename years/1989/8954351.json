 "awd_abstract_narration": "A seven day workshop is being offered by the physics department                 faculty for twenty-five undergraduate physics faculty members selected          from postsecondary institutions in Puerto Rico.  The program is                 enhancing the knowledge and experience of undergraduate faculty members         on computer methods in physics instruction in order that they may               incorporate their increased knowledge and experience in their                   undergraduate teaching.  The methodology consists of hands-on computer          programming methods and numerical analysis experience, using eleven             representative exercises selected from classical and quantum physics,           to familiarize the physics faculty with different types of numerical            and analysis techniques.  The program participants are being supplied           with programs, manuals, instructional materials, and software of all            topics covered.  The main numerical methods being employed are Euler's          method, the Newton-Raphson technique, and the Pade approximation                procedure.                                                                                                                                                      The workshop is stimulating creativity and innovation in the teaching           of physics at the undergraduate level with the result that talented             undergraduate students will have a better understanding of physics and          be attracted to a career in the physical sciences.",
