The College will coordinate efforts of              research professors, minority recruitment officers, mentors,                    industrial and research institutions, and other organizations in order          to achieve the goal of generating, among outstanding minority                   students, long-term interest in and dedication to research.  It is              anticipated that this research involvement will significantly enhance           opportunities for involved minority students to continue their                  education through advanced degree programs (M.S. and Ph.D.).                                                                                                      The Minority Scholar Program will greatly enhance the current                 minority programs at ISU.  In addition, the programs leverage the               already strong commitment of ISU to minority education.  Specifically,          well established minority recruitment and retention programs will be            fully utilized.  However, the supported effort will focus on needs of           truly outstanding minority students.  These efforts include                     development of undergraduate research programs, strong partnerships             with two national laboratories, and establishment of a Minority                 Scholar Program at ISU that focuses on the personal, social, and                professional development of the Minority Scholars.",
