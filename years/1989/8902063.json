 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polyethylene glycol/dextran solutions are used to induce formation of           two aqueous phases in the presence of a protein mixture.  Preferential          partitioning between the phases results in separation of the protein            components.  An electrical field is applied to the solution to                  accelerate the separation of the two phases which form and to cause a           further separation of proteins within the same phase.                                                                                                           This project combines two of the most promising technologies for                large-scale purification of biological compounds, a step critical to            the commercialization of biotechnology.  The combination seems to               address a principle scale-up problem in electrophoresis, namely, the            mixing which arises as thermal convection occurs; the interface                 between the phases is a barrier to convection, and the increased                viscosity of the phases also dampens natural convection.  The                   combination also addresses a limitation of aqueous two phase                    separations, the slow rate of separation of the phases, which has               required the use of expensive centrifuges in the past.",
