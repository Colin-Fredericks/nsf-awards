 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal investigates the sources and dimensions of                        difficulty in decision making.  Just as risk management practices               were advanced by an understanding of the dimensions of risk, the                proposal argues, so should decision management practices be                     advanced by an understanding of the dimensions of perceived                     difficulty.  The proposed research effort seeks to understand the               sources of perceived difficulty by testing whether experts' and                 non.experts' intuitions differ from analytic results in                         systematic ways, using physicians' analyses of medical dilemmas                 as the primary data source.  Specific strategies for reducing the               difficulty of decisions, such as improving the presentation of                  information about temporal consequences and about differences in                option sets, will be tested in the context of real.world                        decisions typically faced by physicians and by non.physicians.                  The ultimate goal of the project, which is to learn new ways to                 make decisions less difficult, was considered to be important                   from both a theoretical and applied perspective, and the                        principal investigators were believed to have both the experience               and the contacts necessary to design and to conduct the proposed                empirical research.",
