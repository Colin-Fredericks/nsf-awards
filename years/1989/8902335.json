 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of this proposal is to understand how                   cytoplasmic factors interact with the genome to effect                          determination and differentiation during early development. Since               the primary germ layers arise during the period when the                        maternal components of the egg are present and can effect gene                  expression, it is important that we understand how the components               of the embryo interact to establish these layers. As a model                    system Dr. Showman is examining the gene coding for alkaline                    phosphatase in the embryonic endoderm of Spisula solidissima.                   Using a combination of cell marking and cell deletion studies he                will determine the lineage of the cells expressing alkaline                     phosphatase and the role of cell interactions in the lineage                    determination process. Coincidentally the gene for Spisula                      alkaline phosphatase will be cloned and characterized in terms of               time of mRNA synthesis, message prevalence, polysome association,               tissue specificity and reiteration frequency. Finally the gene                  will be sequenced to determine its overall structure. From these                studies he will learn the role played by specific cytoplasmic                   components in regulating the expression of a unique marker of a                 defined cell lineage and be in a position to begin an analysis of               the cytoplasmic components themselves.                                          %%%                                                                             This study addresses the mechanism of determination and                         differentiation of specialized cells during the process of                      embryogenesis.                                                                  %%%",
