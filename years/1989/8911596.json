 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most exciting topics today in the area of stellar                    evolution is the formation of new stars and of planetary systems.               We have convincing observational evidence that these events take                place in interstellar clouds of gas and dust that have been                     compressed sufficiently (by a still poorly understood process) for              gravity to pull together locally and at 100s of places the gas and              dust.  As the matter collapses, its residual angular momentum                   causes it to rotate more rapidly, resulting in a central                        condensation and a surrounding disk.  Matter from the disk                      continues to be accreted by the central condensation, which evolves             into a T Tauri star.  The surrounding disk that remains may give                rise to planets.                                                                                                                                                The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue with the                   optical and infrared observations and the theoretical research of               these young stellar objects, which was previously funded by NSF.                In particular, he will focus on T Tauri stars, their variability,               and the disks that surround many of them.  He will also study the               magnetic fields associated with the activity cycles of cool stars.",
