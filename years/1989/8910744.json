 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on problems at the interface of complex analysis and                  analytic number theory will be the central theme of this                        mathematical research.  To obtain additional insight,                           supercomputer experimentation will also play a prominent role.                       From the number-theoretical point of view, the objective of                the work is in understanding properties of roots of various kinds               of transcendental functions: zeta functions.  A particular                      instance is the Epstein zeta function, a complex function                       depending on a class of parameters.  As the parameters vary, the                roots traverse certain paths.  This work seeks to understand this               motion from the standpoint of a statistical/dynamical analysis.                 Similar (statistical) analyses have been found useful in studying               many other types of zeta functions - though here the emphasis                   will shift to studying the roots on the critical line where they                are believed to reside.                                                             Work on complex analysis centers on Schwarzian differential                 equations on compact Riemann surfaces.  Studies of the monodromy                group and the conformal mapping properties of the solution as the               forcing term of the differential equation - the quadratic                       differential - diminishes will be carried out.  Particular                      interest focuses on the case where the differential passes                      through the Bers boundary of Teichmuller space.",
