 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will demonstrate the developmental motoneuron death in            vertebrates is a gene directed event.  This will be pursued by                  determining if embryonic neurons, that are induced to undergo                   developmental death, express the gene, ced-4, which has been shown to           regulate developmental neuronal death in an invertebrate.  Molecular            biology techniques will be used to clone a DNA fragment for ced-4,              which will be used in hybridization assays both in vitro on spinal              cord neurons induced to undergo cell death and in situ on histological          sections of embryonic spinal cord to determine if ced-4 is expressed            when embryonic neurons normally die.  The significance of these                 studies derives from the demonstration that the motoneuron death is a           gene directed event and the establishment of an assay with which to             study the regulation of motoneuron death.                                                                                                                       Interactive activities include teaching a course entitled 'Seminars in          Neurobiology' for senior undergraduates.  The seminars will be open to          all students on campus, and half of the participants will be                    established female scientists working in neurobiology.  The course              will consist of formal presentations by both a student and a senior             scientist followed by an informal gathering.  Dr. Weill will also give          a research seminar and two lectures in the department's developmental           neurobiology course.                                                                                                                                            This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
