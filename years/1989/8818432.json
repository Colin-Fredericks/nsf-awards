 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work from this laboratory has provided information on                 the electrical behavior of mitochondrial membranes by applying                  patch clamp techniques.  The macroscopic currents observed                      confirmed the presence of voltage sensitive channels in                         mitochondrial outer membranes previously observed after                         incorporation of an outer membrane protein (VDAC) into artificial               bilayers.  In addition, a novel behavior which may correspond to                the transient formation of high conductance channels has been                   described.  Completion of these studies and further attempts at                 obtaining single channel recordings with the outer membrane are                 proposed.  Single channel behavior with the inner membrane has                  been observed in this laboratory using voltage clamp techniques.                Multiple conductance levels are observed and a primary goal of                  this proposal is to characterize these levels in terms of their                 channel behavior, e.g. ion selectivity.  The general macroscopic                ionic currents associated with the initiation of metabolism                     include a) a decrease in resistance which is reversed by a                      metabolic inhibitor, b) a change in outward current, and c) a                   change in the magnitude of current fluctuations.  Proposed work                 includes investigation of the underlying events responsible for                 these observations.  In addition, the effect of imposed membrane                potentials on ATP synthesis will be studied.                                       Mitochondria are organelles within cells where biochemical                   reactions convert energy into a useful form that supports many                  other cell functions.  The biochemical reactions going on in                    mitochondria have been the object of much research over many                    years.  It is now generally believed that an important aspect of                the regulation of mitochondrial function involves the                           distribution of ions across the mitochondrial membranes.  \"Patch                clamp\" techniques of electrophysiology that permit measurement of               the permeability pathways for ions across the mitochondrial                     membrane have become available only relatively recently.  The                   proposed research represents one of the first systematic studies                of the permeability properties of intact mitochondrial membranes                taking advantage of this technique.  The results of this research               will make an important contribution to basic knowledge of the                   function of these organelles.",
