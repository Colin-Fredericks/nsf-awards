 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two new senior electives in signal processing with emphasis on                  digital filter design and biomedical signal processing and systems              are now being offered.  This new undergraduate program emphasis in              signal processing requires a laboratory that would provide                      experience in working on practical applications of signal                       processing.  A real-time signal processing laboratory that would                support the experiments and projects illustrating the concepts and              techniques covered in the two new senior electives and in the                   required junior-level course in filter design is being developed.               Emphasis will center on student educational projects involving the              processing of a variety of signals including speech, music,                     seismic, biomedical, and video.  The laboratory experience will be              in the acquisition as well as in the processing of these signals.               The laboratory would also serve as a test bed for VLSI signal                   processing architectures.  The laboratory is based on a central                 server computer networked via Ethernet to workstations and                      personal computers.  Personal computers will be used for the                    acquisition and processing of temporal signals and for low                      level processing and display of images that have been acquired by               the server.",
