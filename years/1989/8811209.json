 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most fish species are ectothermic, i.e. their body temperature is               directly determined and not significantly different from that of                the water in which they live.  This means that, for many                        temperate zone fish species, cell temperatures many vary                        seasonally by >20 degrees centigrade.  Although decreasing                      temperature has a significant depressing effect upon biochemical                reactions, many of these fish species display relatively constant               biological activity at warm and cold temperatures, behavior which               requires adaptive responses at the cellular and biochemical                     level.  In particular, many adaptations of fishes to cold body                  temperature described to date are very similar to those shown by                mammalian species (including man) to different physiological                    stimuli - e.g. endurance training.  Dr. Sidell will utilize the                 more easily studied fish muscle system to :  1) define                          adaptations for metabolism of fatty fuels to support locomotion                 in fishes and how this system is influenced by changes in body                  temperature, and;  2) evaluate the adaptive significance of cold                temperature-induced increases in intracellular fat content upon                 movement of oxygen through muscle.  His experiments will focus                  upon striped bass (Morone saxatilis), a migratory fish of                       considerable economic importance.  The investigator will utilize                gas chromatography to determine how changes in body temperature                 affect the molecular composition of blood-borne and storage                     deposits of lipid (fat) fuels.  The rate-limiting enzyme in                     breakdown of fatty fuels, carnitine long chain fatty                            acyltransferase, will be purified from aerobic muscle of striped                bass.  He will determine by enzyme kinetic analyses and metabolic               experiments with isolated tissues which normally available fatty                acid fuels are best metabolized at different temperatures.  He                  will also quantify the concentrations of an intracellular fatty                 acid binding protein (FABP) in muscles of temperature acclimated                fish.  FABPs have been implicated in accelerating the                           intracellular movement of fatty acids.  Titers of FABPs in                      tissues of thermally-acclimated animals will be correlated with                 the ability of these tissues to metabolize fats.  FABP further                  will be purified and used to perform experiments that will                      directly resolve whether this protein can facilitate movement of                fatty compounds in aqueous solution.  Oxygen electrodes will be                 used to determine whether the presence of lipid droplets in cells               (which accumulate in muscle at cold body temperature) can enhance               the rate of diffusion of oxygen from capillaries to its site of                 cellular utilization, the mitochondria.  Results from these                     studies will better define effects of seasonal cycles in                        temperature upon utilization of lipids which are important                      caloric resources in the aquatic environment.  Findings may apply               to the physiology of less easily studied muscle systems which                   show very similar treatment effects.",
