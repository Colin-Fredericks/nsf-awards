 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to resume the Nain Anorthosite Project to                   pursue geochemical analysis of samples collected during the field               phase of the project (1971-81) funded by NSF.  The intervening                  time has been devoted to geochemistry of the Kiglapait Intrusion                and to magma dynamics.  Recent activities reaffirm that the                     anorthosite problem has major significance to the evolution of                  the earth's crust and mantle.  Spectacular discoveries by members               of this project show (1) that an apparent source enrichment event               took place over a large area of Labrador about 2.3 Ga ago                       (Hamilton); (2) that Pb isotopes give wholerock and wholerock -                 feldspar alignments corresponding to 2.9 and 3.2 Ga,                            respectively, much older than the crystallization age of 1.3 Ga                 (Weis); and (3) that metamorphosed mafic rocks of the Adirondack                region, New York, have almost identical major element trends to                 the calculated liquids of the Kiglapait Intrusion (Olson).  None                of these effects can be explained by crustal contamination, but                 instead carry valuable information on the nature and processes at               the source.  The 2.3 Ga enrichment event may extend across the                  boundaries of 3 or 4 structural provinces of the Canadian Shield.               Trace element studies at contacts of the Nain anorthosite show                  the degree of interaction with crust, and allow evaluation of                   chilled margins as magma compositions.  It is proposed to analyze               country rocks and anorthosites in a 3-tier approach of x-ray                    analyses followed by rare-earth element analyses by neutron acti-               vation, followed by a program of isotopic analyses for Nd and Pb.               These will clarify and extend the current studies by giving                     essential details and constraining hypotheses.  The work will                   have a major impact on the tectonic implications of anorthosites                and their message about the mantle.",
