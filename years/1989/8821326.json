 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the work of Dr.                     William Wulff.  Wulff, a professor of chemistry at the                          University of Chicago, is investigating how metals can be used                  to develop novel reagents that provide unique methods for                       constructing complex organic molecules.  Wulff's work is                        characterized by the basic new knowledge that results as well                   as interesting applications to natural products syntheses.  A                   goal of the work is the development of metal-carbene complexes                  that allow for immediate assembly of ring systems.                                                                                                              The chemistry of chromium, molybdenum, tungsten and manganese                   carbene complexes, and their use in organic synthesis is the                    basis for this proposal.  New annulation protocols are being                    developed which will find application in the construction of                    polycyclic systems characteristic of a number of classes of                     natural products.  Included in these studies are \u01312 + 2! and                    \u01313 + 2! cycloaddition reactions.  Basic investigations of the                   influences of structure, solvent, and metals to the success of                  the reactions will be an integral part of this work.  Detailed                  mechanism analyses will provide the basis for predicting how                    structural and electronic features of the metal-carbene complex                 and the substrate will influence the scope of the reaction.",
