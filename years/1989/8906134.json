 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is directed toward studying the regulation of 5S RNA,              which is one component of ribosome biogenesis.  In higher eukaryotes, 5S        RNA is small 120 nts RNA which, although an essential component of              ribosomes, is still only partially understood in its ribosome location          and function.  In somatic cells 5S RNA is synthesized in the nucleus,           and targeted to the nucleolus where it is incorporated into nascent             larger ribosomal subunits. In oocytes, the synthesis of a large amount          of 5S RNA precedes by several weeks, the activation of rRNA and r               protein synthesis and the beginning of ribosome biogenesis. Therefore,          this naturally occurring a synchrony in the on set of synthesis of              ribosome components affords us a unique opportunity to study the various        step sand the regulation involved in the targeting of 5S RNA to the             nucleolus and the requirements for 5S RNA incorporation how 5S RNA is           added to the nascent large ribosomal subunit during oogenesis in Xenopus        laevis.  A further aim is to establish the mechanism(s) for ferrying the        5S RNA out to the cytoplasm, keeping it stored there, and then                  transporting it back into the nucleus, specifically into the nucleolus.         In a larger context, the oocyte system will facilitate our understanding        of how nuclear proteins interact with specific RNA molecules, and what          is required for transport of RNPs in and out of the nucleus.  The oocyte        studies will likely amplify our understanding of how somatic cell 5S            RNAis targeted to and incorporated into nascent                                 ribosomes forming with in the nucleolus, a process which probably               occurs entirely with in the somatic cell nucleus.",
