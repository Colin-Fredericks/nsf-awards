 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1863, US Secretary of Agriculture Isaac Newton wrote that \"It                should be the aim of every young farmer . . . to make two blades                of grass grow where but one grew before.\"  From 1863 to 1940,                   increases in agricultural production were due largely to                        increases in the acreage cultivated and partially to enhanced                   production per acre.  Since 1940, however, a \"green revolution\"                 has occurred in which, through scientific plant breeding methods,               production per acre has increased not just two fold as Newton                   aimed for but four fold so that \"four blades of grass grow where                but one grew before.\"  Dr. Perkins is continuing his examination                of this green revolution and the impact it has had on human                     social life:  globally, we are becoming a species that lives                    primarily in urban areas with only a minority of people left in                 production agriculture in the rural areas.  This transformation                 is essentially complete in industrialized countries and is still                underway in less industrialized nations.                                                                                                                        As a science, plant breeding has been fundamentally dependent                   conceptually upon the genetic theories first proposed by Mendel.                In order to function productively, plant breeders were dependent                upon insights from statisticians, plant physiologists, soil                     scientists, plant pathologists, agricultural engineers, and food                technologists.  Most breeders found their institutional homes in                government and university laboratories, but some worked for                     private companies.  Issues of war and national security shaped                  the political economic context in which plant breeders worked.                  Events in World War I set the stage for the growth of plant                     breeding as a national asset.  World War II, the demise of                      colonial empires, and the cold war provided enormous boost to                   plant breeding as nations sought increased security through                     enhanced food production.  It is now impossible to understand the               treatment of plant breeding by political institutions without                   discussing the strategic implications of the science.                                                                                                           Dr. Perkins is examining all these issues in the context of a                   comparative study of the complexities of the agricultural                       industry, especially wheat breeding, in Britain,India and the                   United States.  The research is being carried out through                       examination of primary archival sources, oral interviews and                    search of the published literature.",
