 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is being funded by the Synthetic Organic                          Chemistry Program for the research of Dr. Nathan L. Bauld of                    the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas at                       Austin. The work will develop new mild reactions for forming                    complex ring structures.  These structures are found in many of                 the substances used in agriculture and medicine.                                                                                                                The research continues the development of hole-catalyzed                        pericyclic reactions, both for synthetic purposes and to gain                   fundamental understanding of the structures and reaction paths                  of organic cation radicals.  The hole-catalyzed Diels-Alder                     reaction (DA) has undergone extensive development and has                       recently been exemplified in the synthesis of the sesquiterpene                 natural product (-)-B-selinene.  Further mechanistic,                           stereochemical, and kinetic studies of this and other                           pericyclic reactions are planned in order to answer more                        decisively fundamental questions relating to reaction concert,                  role selectivity, and directness vs. indirectness.  A new and                   powerful methodology for indirect addition in a net DA sense to                 highly hindered dienes has been developed and will be refined,                  extended, and illustrated in the synthesis of compounds in the                  drimane series.  Previous hole-catalyzed direct Diels-Alder                     applications (e.g. B-selinene) have emphasized the                              diene/electron rich alkene format.  A new and very promising                    strategy for effecting Diels-Alder cycloadditions in the                        diene/diene format, which nevertheless produces highly                          differentiated alkene functionalities, has been observed and                    will be developed.  The newly developed hole-catalyzed                          vinylcyclobutane rearrangement can be used to achieve net                       Diels-Alder addition.  The hole-catalyzed vinylcyclobutane                      reaction will also be developed extensively in both a                           mechanistic and synthetic sense.",
