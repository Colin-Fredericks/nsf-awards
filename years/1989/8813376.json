 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for Professor Marc J. Klowden,              Division of Entomology, University of Idaho, to spend his sabbatical            in the laboratory of Hans Briegel, Institute of Zoology, University             of Zurich.  They share an interest in how endogenous factors regulate           insect behavior, and they will collaborate in a study of how several            humoral factors, present during egg development in the mosquito,                inhibit host seeking and increase the attraction to oviposition                 sites.  Professor Klowden's approach until now has largely been to              use microsurgery, involving gland ablation and transplantation.                 Through collaboration with Dr. Briegel and others at Zurich, he                 expects to learn their biochemical approach, including techniques for           fractionating the components in the male accessory glands.  His                 research goals for this six-month visit are to extract the accessory            gland components of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, test the                     individual components for their behavioral effects in gravid females,           and identify the components that show activity in the pre-oviposition           bioassay.                                                                                                                                                       Although pre-oviposition behavior does not directly influence the               vector potential of a mosquito population, it is a major factor in              reproductive success and the maintenance of adult population                    densities.  In order to understand better the epidemiology of                   mosquito-borne diseases, it is helpful also to understand the                   mechanisms that control mosquito behavior and how the female comes to           express a particular behavior at a particular time.  It is                      conceivable that natural products could be identified that interfere            with the pre-oviposition behavior of many different insects; however,           the mechanisms that regulate this behavior need to be understood                first.  This research will contribute to that goal.",
