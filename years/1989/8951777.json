 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spectrometer can spark the interest of the freshman chemistry               student.  It is a powerful analytical instrument that most students             identify as a state-of-the-art tool used by practicing chemists.  This          project involves placing a spectrometer at each lab station so that             each pair of lab students have their own instrument.  The experiments           include the discovery of the nature of light, verification of the law           governing solution concentration and optical, spectral analysis of              various student prepared compounds ranging from aspirin to coordination         complexes, and evaluation of an equilibrium constant.  Many of the              planned activities are closely connected to other experiments or skills         that include reading analog meter displays, graphing techniques,                solution preparation, synthesis, volumetric titration, ion exchange             chromatography, and computer interfacing.  Spectrometry can serve as a          focal point of mathematical and chemical concepts for students in               laboratory courses.                                                                                                                                             The institution is matching the grant with an equal amount of funds.",
