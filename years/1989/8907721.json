 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is providing some of                    the funds to support travel of participants to an international                 conference-particularly for some of the junior participants                     (e.g.,Assistant Professors), to subsidize graduate students and                 post doctorates by permitting them to attend at a lower fee                     than more senior participants. This is The Second International                 Conference on Heteroatom Chemistry to be held July 16-21, 1989                  on the campus of the State University of New York (SUNY) at                     Albany in Albany, NY.  The purpose of this conference is to                     bring together in an international forum, academic and                          industrial researchers studying organic compounds containing                    such heteroatoms as Sb, Bi, B, F, P, Se, Si, S, Te, and Sn for                  such varied purposes as organic synthesis, and mechanistic and                  structure-theoretical investigations in order to promote a                      broader interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge than is                         possible at more specialized meetings. The topics to be                         emphasized at the Heteroatom Conference include                                 heteroatom-directed organic synthesis, synthesis and reactions                  of chiral heteratomic compounds, heteroatom-containing enzyme                   inhibitors, theoretical-structural studies of heteroatomic                      systems, and uncommon bonding involving heteroatoms.  The                       format of this conference provides 12 hour-long and 12                          half-hour-long formal presentations by invited speakers,                        selected 15-minute talks, two poster sessions and several                       social events.  The speakers and participants come from a                       variety of countries.",
