 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the research of Dr. Peter Wagner, Michigan State                    University. The work is focused on photochemical mechanisms of                  a variety of organic compounds. These studies are designed to                   elucidate the details of the interactions between organic                       molecules and light. Their understanding is important for a                     number of chemical and biological processes.                                                                                                                    Chemical interactions between two discrete parts of one                         molecule are at the core of most modern synthetic organic                       reactions.  Many such reactions are initiated uniquely by the                   absorption of light.  Several such light-induced reactions are                  the main subject of this work.  The use of light to promote                     reactions within one molecule not only allows some new                          reactions that could not otherwise occur, but also provides                     unique insight into how molecules change shape and into the                     geometries required for various chemical reactions. Because the                 reactions of light-excited molecules are as fast as the motions                 by which molecules change their shapes, altogether new                          competitions occur that cannot be measured in thermal                           chemistry.  Several systems will be studied in which the                        orientation of the two reactive components in one molecule can                  be varied so that the effect of such orientation on specific                    reactions can be assessed.  The reactions to be studied include                 transfer of excitation energy; electron transfer, sometimes                     followed by chemical bonding and novel product formation;                       hydrogen atom transfer, followed by novel product formation;                    and cleavage of halogen atoms to produce polymerization                         initiators.",
