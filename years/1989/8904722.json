 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the possible rigidity of structures                  which are composed of bars joined at their ends by universal                    joints and then reinforced by cables joining some of these joints               to others.  The rods are to be incompressible, and the cables are               to be unstretchable.  Simple and graphic as this model is, it                   embodies deep mathematical principles and calls for subtle                      analysis.                                                                            Maria Terrell and Robert Connelly have been studying such                  cabled frameworks, asking questions including the following.                    Suppose a framework has its vertices and bars along the natural                 vertices and edges of a convex polyhedron in 3-dimensional space.               How few cables need one add to render such a framework                          infinitesimally rigid?  Can one calculate easily which cabled                   frameworks are globally rigid?  To what extent can group                        representations be used to study the global rigidity of cabled                  frameworks exhibiting certain groups of symmetries?                                  Answers to some specific questions of this sort may have                   value for the design of robot arms.  Moreover, the mathematical                 tools which are called for in attacking questions about                         frameworks will be sharpened and thus improved for all possible                 uses.",
