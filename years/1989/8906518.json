 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Horst Worm and Professor Subir                Banerjee of the University of Minnesota in collaboration with Prof.             Jaime Urrutia-Fucugauchi of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de                Mexico (UNAM).  The researchers intend to study the magnetic record             in historic lava flows and to compare it with magnetic observatory              data.  Mexico is uniquely suited for this purpose because its active            volcanic history has supplied numerous historic lava flows of varying           composition and cooling history.  Equally important, direct deter-              minations of the geomagnetic field are available since 1791.                                                                                                    The proposed research will consist of two phases.  First, the                   variation of magnetic remanences in lava flows of different charac-             teristics will be systematically studied in vertical and horizontal             profiles.  Additionally, magnetic properties and ore petrological               characteristics will be determined.                                                                                                                             Results from the first phase of the study will provide an excellent             basis for systematic paleointensity method studies.  Thermal and non-           thermal methods will be evaluated for their applicability, accuracy,            and efficiency.  Natural remanent magnetizations (NRM's) will be                studied in the paleomagnetic laboratory at UNAM while magnetic                  hysteresis, anisotropy and other measurements as well as detailed               intensity determinations will be performed at the University of                 Minnesota.  In addition microprobe and scanning electron microscope             work will involve Prof. Negendank in Germany, thus adding a multi-              lateral dimension to this project.  The proposed work will be the               first stage in studying the paleointensity record all the way back to           Permian times since when Mexico has retained an almost unique                   continuous volcanic record.",
