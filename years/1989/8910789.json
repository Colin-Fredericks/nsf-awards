 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will examine human influences on, and                           considerations relating to, the dispersal of genetically-altered                living organisms into the aquatic environment.  The topic of the                conference promises an opportunity for the building of bridges                  between the social sciences, interested in questions of risk and                organizational responses, and the biological sciences, interested               in questions of biotechnology development and the fate of                       genetically-altered organisms when released to the natural                      environment.  The topic is important, new, and holds great                      scientific and financial challenges for both the research                       community and industry.                                                                                                                                         This conference, to be held in Los Angeles February 15-16, 1989,                will be in conjunction with the annual meeting of the National                  Shellfisheries Association.  Over 30 scientists and research                    managers will make presentations, stressing the commonality of                  approaches used to assess benefits from genetic engineering due                 to enhanced food production and risks from genetic engineering                  due to the possibility of harm to aquatic and other plants or                   animals.  In addition, the links between biological systems and                 social systems (e.g., the communities dependent on fisheries                    production for their livelihood) will be emphasized, in the terms               of the risks and benefits accompanying deliberate releases of                   genetically-altered organisms.",
