 "awd_abstract_narration": "Andrew Casson will study aspects of the geometrization                     problem for 3-manifolds.  He will attempt to improve the                        \"Strong torus theorem\" to conclude that irreducible 3-manifolds                 which contain essential singular tori either contain essential                  embedded surfaces of genus one or are Seifert fibered spaces.                   His method is related to one used by Tukia.  He will also                       attempt to find good usable conditions on a 3-manifold                          guaranteeing the existence of representations of the                            fundamental group in PSL2(C).  In particular, he will seek                      methods of finding hyperbolic or other geometrically                            interesting representations.                                                         Robion Kirby will continue studying Witten's program for                   defining an invariant of framed 3-manifolds via an \"average\" of                 the Chern-Simons invariants for SU(n) valued connections.  He                   will also work on the diffeomorphism classification of smooth                   4-manifolds obtained by \"Gluck twists\" on imbedded 2-spheres,                   or a generalization to immersed 2-spheres with one double point.                     Yakov Eliashberg will study invariants of Legendrian knots.                     All three projects concern different aspects of                            3-dimensional manifolds, which are natural geometric objects                    describable locally by 3 independent coordinates.  The                          structure of 3-manifolds has relevance to other parts of                        mathematics inasmuch as such manifolds occur as solution sets                   of ordinary or differential equations.  Relevance to physical                   theories is also evident.",
