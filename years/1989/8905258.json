 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using the simple eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have                    recently succeeded in identifying a set of five small nuclear                   RNAs (snRNAs) that mediate pre-messenger RNA splicing.  We have                 definitively established a 1:1 correspondence between these                     spliceosomal RNAs of yeast, and U1, U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs of                    mammalian cells, despite surprising differences in size and                     structural organization.  These data have provided unexpected                   insights into the evolutionary constraints operating on the                     spliceosomal RNAs, revealing a functional hierarchy which places                U6 at the center of this RNA-based machine.  Toward the long-term               goal of determining the three-dimensional structure of the                      spliceosome, we will now proceed to augment this information by                 the establishment of a larger phylogenetic data base comprised of               snRNA sequences from selected fungal representatives.  In                       conjunction with chemical and enzymatic conformational probing,                 phylogenetically derived structural models will also be tested                  using genetics.  Deletion analyses will be used to delineate                    absolutely required structure: function domains; since our                      initial forays have demonstrated that even phylogenetically                     conserved elements may perform functions dispensable for                        viability, we anticipate generating a collection of                             \"mini-snRNAs\" smaller than any found in nature.  In a                           complementary approach, we will assess the contributions of                     species-specific and evolutionarily invariant domains by                        performing inter-species \"swaps\", using engineered chimeras to                  complement deletion strains in yeast.  Beyond their obvious                     impact on a mechanistic understanding of splicing, by focusing on               the RNA-based functions of the spliceosomal machinery these                     approaches will also provide an experimental avenue to explore                  the provocative hypothesis that the trans-acting snRNAs once                    resided within the introns of self-splicing RNAs.",
