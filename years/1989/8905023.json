 "awd_abstract_narration": "An organism's DNA is constantly subject to damage from                          various agents in the environment (such as chemicals and                        ultraviolet radiation) as well as from derivatives of oxygen                    generated during its cells' own respiration.  All species of                    organisms, from the most primitive to the most complex,                         synthesize a number of different enzymes whose function is to                   repair different types of DNA damage.  This is a proposal to                    investigate the organization of the genes encoding DNA repair                   enzymes in a group of interrelated species of fishes.  This                     work should shed light on how these functions evolved among                     the vertebrates, a topic about which we know little.  The                       evolutionary knowledge thus gained could help to elucidate                      some of the complex and only partially understood                               relationships among different DNA repair functions in                           mammals, including humans.",
