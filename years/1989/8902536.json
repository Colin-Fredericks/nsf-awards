 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cache hierarchies, heretofore rarely used, will become common in future         shared-memory computers because:  (1) processors are speeding up                relative to main memories, (2) on-chip caches are useful but not large          enough to obviate the need for off-chip caches and (3) specializing             caches to reduce interconnection bandwidth is important to shared-              memory multiprocessors. Secondary caches, those caches not adjacent to          processors, need to be studied since they operate in a different system         context than level one caches (those adjacent to processors).  Few              studies have examined secondary caches.  Secondary caches, for example,         need only do block transfers and are not referenced on every cycle as           do level one caches.  These and other differences between the                   operational requirements of secondary and level one caches should lead          to significantly different implementations.                                                                                                                     Several aspects of secondary cache organization are examined including:         (1) new methods for implementing set-associativity, (2) how cache               coherency invalidates affect optional cache organization, and (3) when          tag or data memory should be implemented with dynamic RAM.  The methods         used are analytic modeling, trace-driven simulation and trial                   implementations.",
