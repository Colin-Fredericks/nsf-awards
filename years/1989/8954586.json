The                        collaborative project will be supported by the nine county offices              of education, California State University at Chico,                             representatives from new elementary science curricular programs,                local school districts, government agencies, and citizen's                      organizations.  Project participants will be recruited in teams of              three or four to include an administrator and two or three                      teachers serving students in grades K-8.  A total of 150                        participants will be directly reached by the project.  Training                 will span all three years and will include workshops in two                     consecutive summers and academic year inservice days, as well as a              three day mid-winter Field Conference.  In addition, the project                will provide ongoing support for the teachers, newsletters, and                 coordinated exchanges between schools.  The schools will provide                the materials and supplies for the teachers to support the                      adoption of an inquiry based elementary science program.                                                                                                        The cost sharing for the project will be twenty-one percent.",
