 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streptomyces are soil bacteria that undergo morphogenesis in                    response to environmental stress.  These microorganisms also                    produce the majority of antibiotics and antimetabolites used                    therapeutically throughout the world.  The genus Streptomyces is                therefore of interest from both biological and practical                        viewpoints.  To understand the nature of regulatory mechanisms                  that function during cellular differentiation, we will                          characterize a cloned DNA fragment (ORF1425) that is involved in                the sporulation of Streptomyces griseus. The expression of                      ORF1425 will be analyzed by RNA hybridization studies, to                       determine whether the ORF1425 transcript accumulates at a                       specific stage of the life cycle and whether there is more than                 one transcript made from the ORF1425 gene.  We will initiate                    studies to determine whether sporulation of S. griseus is, like                 that of S. coelicolor, dependent on the bldA gene product by                    cloning and sequencing the bldA gene product by cloning and                     sequencing the bldA gene from S. griseus and the ORF1425 gene                   from S. coelicolor.  Analysis of the regulation of ORF1425                      expression during the streptomycete life cycle will contribute                  significantly to our knowledge of mechanisms by which these                     relatively simple organisms regulate developmental processes in a               temporal fashion.  Because streptomycetes tend to undergo                       sporulation and antibiotic production simultaneously, the results               of these experiments may also elucidate mechanisms by which                     streptomycetes regulate the biosynthesis of antibiotics.  The use               of Streptomyces as a model system will extend our understanding                 of fundamental patterns of cell differentiation that operate in                 both simple and complex organisms.",
