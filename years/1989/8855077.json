The program will serve 120                students entering grades eight, nine or ten.                                                                                                                    Program participants will be 90 percent Black, Hispanic, Native                 American or Puerto Rican, and will be selected through written                  applications and staff interviews.                                                                                                                              Young Scholars Program will introduce students to engineering and               science concepts in ways that will demonstrate to them how                      academic course work relates to the future, how science and                     engineering relate to the world around them, and how the practice               of science is accomplished.  The program will also involve                      parents by helping them to become informed and activity involved                in the education of their children.                                                                                                                             The summer program includes morning mathematics and English                     courses, seminars on culture and ethics, afternoon                              pre-engineering activities (speakers, fieldtrips, and projects)                 and a \"shadowing\" program, whereby students will work on the job                with mentor scientists and engineers.  Evening and Saturday                     workshops will provide parents and students with information on a               variety of topics, including college entrance requirements,                     financial aid, making the transition from middle school to                      secondary school, and career options in science and engineering.",
