 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dagan Corporation has recently developed an integrating patch                   clamp that uses a capacitor in the headstage to sense charge.                   Both the noise and band width characteristics of this instrument                are superior to those of resistive patch clamps.  However,                      preliminary studies indicate that the packages of the individual                electronic components are adding significant noise to the system.               Under the direction of Dr. Allan Erickson, the firm will examine                background noise and determine methods to reduce this noise to a                minimum.  The applied approach will involve the use of a hybrid                 integrated circuit with unique packaging materials.  In Phase 1                 of the research, the optimal choices of materials for various                   parts of the package will be determined.  Phase 2 focus on                      developing an actual probe incorporating the knowledge gained in                Phase 1.  In Phase 3, the patch clamp probe designed in Phase 2                 will be combined with the remaining support circuitry, and a                    commercial patch clamp will be built and marketed.  In addition,                a general purpose current monitor for sub-picoamp measurements                  will be developed for use in other instruments.",
