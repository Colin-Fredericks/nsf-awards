 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research builds upon and greatly expands studies of the               long-period evolution of the atmosphere-ocean system and its                    relationship to short period climate variability of surface                     variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation and wind) over North                America.  Besides improving understanding of the interactions                   within this complex system, the ultimate goal is to develop                     improved tools for predicting the circulation and climate over                  extended periods.  In particular, this study will involve the low               frequency (seasonal-to-decadal) variability of macro-scale                      features of the SST field and its relationship to the Northern                  Hemisphere atmospheric general circulation, surface temperature                 and precipitation over North America.  The approach taken will be               primarily empirical (synoptic and statistical), involving                       conceptual physics and employing atmospheric and oceanic fields.                Finally,  the possibility that the occurrence of earthquakes is                 conditioned by persistently recurrent atmospheric pressure                      systems will be investigated.  Although this topic is bound to be               controversial, preliminary evidence suggests a link between the                 large-scale configuration of monthly and seasonal atmospheric                   pressure anomalies and earthquakes in Southern California.                           The importance of this research is that if successful, it                  will lead to improved climate prediction on short (monthly to                   decadal) time scales.",
