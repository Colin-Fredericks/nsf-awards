 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increasing availability of parallel computing systems, the             problems associated with constructing parallel algorithms, mapping them         onto parallel architectures, and determining algorithm and system               performance have grown in importance.  The results of poor mappings are         inefficient computation and system performance, and an overall                  reduction in the speedups potentially obtainable from a given parallel          processor.                                                                                                                                                      The proposed research is aimed at examining approaches to allocating            tasks to processors in a manner that ensures effective use of the               available resources (i.e., high processor utilization with minimal              delays due to interprocessor communications).  A number of task                 allocation (load balancing) algorithms are proposed.  One is based on           utilizing a new parallel simulated annealing algorithm, while a third           is a hybrid of the former two approaches.  Contrasting these algorithms         with each other, and with other algorithms proposed in the literature           is a key part of the proposed research.",
