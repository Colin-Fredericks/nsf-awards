 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electromagnetic wave scattering by random media is important for many           areas including remote sensing and target identification.  Although             considerable progress has been reported on the wave propagation and             scattering in random media, there are many unanswered problems                  including the backscattering enhancement effect in the millimeter wave          and microwave regions.  To understand the interaction of the                    electromagnetic wave with medium, it is important to have experimental          data obtained under controlled environments.  We propose to conduct             the carefully controlled experiments using random media of known                statistical characteristics in the millimeter wave and microwave                regions.  In the surface scattering study we will construct surfaces            of known mean heights and correlation distances and measure both                bistatic and backscattering cross-sections.  The backscattering                 enhancement effect by rough surface will be carefully investigated.             In the imaging study we will build a special chamber and investigate            the reconstructed image quality for different particle characteristics          and distributions.  The proposed project will enhance our                       understanding of how the electromagnetic wave is scattered by random            media, and will have important practical applications in the                    microwave, millimeter wave, and sub-millimeter wave remote sensing.",
