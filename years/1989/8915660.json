 "awd_abstract_narration": "This special award will give graduate student Eva Charfauros                    additional flexibility in pursuing her graduate studies and                     research initiation in sociology. The proposed research will                    undertake a comparative study of two university programs designed               for 'third world and minority students' (one at Brown, the other                at the University of California at San Diego). Through a                        combination of site visits, informal interviews and retrieval of                archival materials, this PI will study the relationship between                 the organization and administration of these programs and the                   relative achievement of their founding goals -- to enhance the                  access of minorities to higher education and their academic                     success in college. This is a timely topic closely related to the               Foundation's abiding concern for the increased recruitment of                   minorities in science and engineering. This award grows out of a                special directorate level program to enhance the graduate                       education of previous applicants of minority fellowship programs                receiving honorable mention ratings. This award should strengthen               minority research participation in sociology.",
