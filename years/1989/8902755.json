 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human decision making and coordination strategies within a                   distributed organization are known to be less than optimal,                     especially as the workload under which the team must operate                    increases. This project will employ a normative-descriptive                     approach to systematically investigate team performance in                      such contexts. The fundamental tenet of the normative-descriptive               theory is that motivated expert decision makers strive for                      optimality, but are constrained from achieving it by their                      inherent limitations and cognitive biases.  The                                 normative-descriptive theory employs normative solutions as a                   baseline, and modifies these solutions by placing psychologically               interpretable constraints and structure on the team's cognitive                 processes to provide accurate predictions of team performance.                  These models, which are experimentally validated, provide a                     relevant basis for designing distributed database and                           communication subsystems that best support the needs of human                   decision makers.                                                                  The working hypothesis put forward in this project is that                    human teams adapt their coordination strategies to workload                     demands.  At low workload teams prefer to coordinate explicitly                 using communication channels.  Under moderate workload teams rely               on implicit coordination, exercising internal models to                         anticipate the needs of other team members.  Under high workload                off-line pre-planning replaces on-line coordination.  This                      project will investigate, using the normative-descriptive                       approach, explicit and implicit coordination in the areas of team               information processing, resource allocation, and task sequencing.               The research on information coordination  characterizes the                     amount of communication needed among team members for superior                  explicit coordination, and the role of feedback as a means of                   improving implicit coordination.  The research on resource and                  task coordination focuses on when a leader is necessary to                      improve coordination, and on how coordination strategies change                 when different mixes of sequential, parallel, and multiple                      actions must be taken by the team.  The research on database                    support addresses the questions of database modeling structures                 needed to support the requirements of different forms of                        coordination in an organization, and develops algorithms for                    dynamically (re)locating the data in the network for effective                  coordination.",
