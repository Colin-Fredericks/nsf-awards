 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in                                     heterogeneous catalysis to be conducted by Prof.                                Eduardo E. Wolf of the University of Notre Dame and                             Mr. Paulo Araya of the Chemical Engineering Department                          of the University of Chile.  The work will be mainly                            experimental studies using infrared techniques                                  developed at Notre Dame to verify theoretical work now                          in progress.  Heterogeneous catalysts are used to                               accelerate chemical reactions.  Studying these                                  reactions can be crucially important to the petroleum                           and chemical industries.  Infrared spectroscopy has                             shown that the catalysts' microstructure is important                           in determining the dynamic response of the catalyst to                          changes in operating conditions.                                                                                                                                The theoretical models of catalytic surfaces have been                          developed by Mr. Araya at Notre Dame in collaboration                           with Prof. Wolf.  Now the experimental work to verify                           them will be carried out by extending Mr. Araya's                               stay.  This work will be part of his Ph.D. thesis at                            the University of Chile and will form the basis of                              beginning a research group in this area in Chile which                          will develop and continue the collaboration between                             the two countries.  In this way this support will help                          fulfill the goals of the Science in Developing                                  Countries program.",
