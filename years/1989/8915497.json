 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will attempt to merge microelectronics, chemical-                  selective membranes, and bioreagents (enzymes and antibodies) to                produce integrated biosensor arrays.  It will capitalize on recent              advances in all three of these areas.  The enabling technology to be            developed under this proposal is the ability to selectively bind                bioactive species to specific sites on the underlying chemical sensor           chip, in a methodology which allows processing of full wafers                   (thousands of sensors) at once.  This will be done using photoreactive          heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents in process steps which are            similar to conventional integrated circuit photolithography, and                require only slight modifications to standard integrated-circuit                processing equipment.                                                                                                                                           Microbiosensor arrays for multianalyte analysis will be formed by               repeating the immobilization procedure on a wafer, using different              bioreagents, and a photomask aligned to select different                        immobilization sites.  The well-controlled linking process should               yield biomolecule layers which have a high and predictable activity.            This general approach is directly adaptable to detecting a very wide            range of compounds by varying the immobilized biological components.                                                                                            The resulting biosensors will utilize the natural recognition,                  affinity and catalysis of bioreagent species in conjunction with                selective chemical transducers and integrated electronics.  These               sensors will significantly advance capabilities for low-cost direct             measurement of pollutants, drugs, hormones and metabolic compounds.",
