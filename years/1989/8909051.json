 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general theme of this research is to understand how                    sensory information is encoded and processed in the central                     nervous system in order to generate coordinated motor outputs.                  Dr. Christopher Comer will continue to study central integration                in a model system where the traffic of neural signals in the CNS                can be easily monitored, assigned to identified interneurons, and               related to the performance of a discrete and easily recorded                    behavioral act.  Cockroaches evade a predator's strike by turning               away and then running.  This orientating response may be used as                a model system to determine how signals are processed in the CNS                to control the occurrence and form of directional movement.                     Specific, identifiable, giant interneurons in cockroaches which                 are wind-sensitive cells, will be thoroughly examined                           electrophysiologically and anatomically for their role in escape                behavior.  These studies will give us a more complete                           understanding of how the nervous system encodes and communicates                for escape and startle responses.",
