 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to gain more information about the band offset                         in the strained layer InxGa1-xAs/GaAs system we propose                         a detailed systematic study of the photoreflectance                             spectra from a series of well characterized single                              quantum well structures with different physical                                 parameters, i.e., well width, strain and In composition (x).                    In single quantum wells additional information about                            band offsets can be obtained since light-hole transitions                       will only be observed when the conduction band offset,                          Qc~<0.5.  This is a collaborative effort between Brooklyn                       College and ETDL, Ft. Monmouth.  Photoreflectance                               measurements will be carried out at Brooklyn College.                           The heterostructures will be fabricated by molecular                            beam epitaxy at ETDL, Ft. Monmouth.  In addition                                certain characterization procedures such as high-                               resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to                            determine well width and Raman scattering to evaluate                           x and e will be carried out at Ft. Monmouth.  To date                           there has been little systematic work on well                                   characterized samples of this system.",
