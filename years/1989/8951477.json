 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of NMR spectroscopy to study molecular structure and               dynamics is now an essential element of an effective                            undergraduate chemistry program.  The Chemistry Department at                   Connecticut College purchased a 250Mhz FT-NMR which is integrated               throughout the curriculum.  Students at the freshman level are                  introduced to FT-NMR in general chemistry with the hope that this               introduction to this exciting technology will stimulate the                     students to continue to study sciences.  Specific applications                  exploiting the full capabilities of the FT-NMR are incorporated                 into organic chemistry, spectroscopic methods, instrumental                     methods, biochemistry, physical chemistry, and the new course on                synthesis and characterization of inorganic compounds.  These                   applications enhance the understanding of theoretical concepts                  already introduced into the classroom.  Also, undergraduate                     participation in faculty directed research is strong and                        expanding.  The availability of FT-NMR enhances the ability of                  the students to carry out successful projects.  The institution                 is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
