 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient hierarchical planning, based on a task network, is the                topic of this research.  Goal and subgoal interactions will be                  investigated to achieve improved control strategies for planning.               For example, it should be possible to improve both the quality of               the plan and the efficiency of the planning process by developing               a control strategy which selects among alternative task                         reductions in such a way as to avoid harmful interactions while                 encouraging helpful interactions.  The following specific issues                are central to this investigation:  (1) how the various                         properties of interactions can guide the choice among                           alternative reductions in a task network; (2) how to improve the                consistency of task network representations, in particular, how                 to identify situations where a seemingly unresolvable conflict                  can be resolved at a lower level in the task network; (3) how to                take advantage of the fact that some planning tasks, while not                  independent in general, become independent once certain other                   plannng decisions have been made.  The investigators anticipate                 that completion of the above research topics will result in                     significantly improved planning in a number of environments.  To                test this idea, they will implement a planning system                           incorporating the above ideas, and evaluate its performance on a                number of domains.",
