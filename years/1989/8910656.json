It is                  thus 'a-morphous' in dispensing with morphemes rather than in the               sense of lacking form.  Three general problem areas will be                     addressed.                                                                                                                                                           First, if rules rather than morphemes are the foundation of                word structure, words should have much less internal non-                       phonological form than commonly assumed.  The investigator will                 examine the idea that most such structure, such as that usually                 associated with the presence of boundaries or junctures, and with               a phrase-marker-like arrangement of morphemes into higher level                 constituents, can be eliminated.                                                                                                                                     Secondly, the research will pursue the notion that a single                class of phonological operations on word forms characterizes                    phonology, word level morphology, and also the introduction of                  phonologically dependent clitics.  Treating clitics as \"phrase                  level morphology\" has significant implications for several                      problems in syntax as well as for phonology and morphology.                                                                                                          Finally, the investigator will explore the implementation of               grammars of word structure of this type in the form of computer                 programs.  Such implementation involves several difficult issues,               such as the proper representation of the full autosegmental and                 metrical structure of a word; the balance between general and                   language particular principles in the interaction of sound                      structural rules; and the degree and nature of parallelism                      appropriate to the parsing of morphological structure.                          %%%                                                                                  The linguistic theory of grammatical structure at the level                of the word -- \"morphology\" -- has long presented special                       problems.  In some ways structure at the level of the word seems                intuitively more obvious than other levels of grammatical struc-                ture, such as the sentence, and yet it has proven much more                     resistant to a comprehensive, coherent theoretical account.  One                reason for this is the great diversity from one language to                     another in the nature of what the speakers perceive as individual               words.  The investigator in this project has been developing a                  quite novel theory of morphology, which accounts for a number of                phenomena which have been unexplained in other theoretical                      models.  The next phase of the research will test the theory                    against certain problematic cases from a variety of different                   languages, and will also implement the theory as a computer                     program, to enable further testing of its consistency and                       applicability to a wide variety of cases.",
