 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on the modelling, analysis, and design of so-          called hybrid systems.  Hybrid means the system is comprised of a               decision making process (called a discrete event, DE, supervisory               controller) interacting with a continuous-time (CT) process.  Examples          of such systems include flexible manufacturing systems and in general           any management or decision making structure which superimposes its              will (decisions) on a continuous-time process at discrete time                  instants.  By investigating the mechanics of specific examples such as          a management decision making structure implementing an optimal profit-          maximizing harvesting policy on a fishery resource, one can define the          structure of a hybrid system model.  Proper development of such a               rudimentary model will result in effective simulation, analysis, and            control strategies for hybrid systems.  Specifically the model will             readily adapt to the inexpensive and evolving computer, information,            communication, and industrial technologies which will continue to               impact the control of real world processes for years to come.",
