 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal theme of this research is the application of group-               theoretic techniques to a wide variety of search problems.  The                 ultimate objective is to combine algebraic techniques with standard             search methods to solve problems which are currently solvable by                neither method alone.  The research has three major aspects; the                development of an experimental system for testing algorithmic ideas;            and the exploration of methods for representing search problems in an           algebraic setting, and of tools for solving them.  The algorithms to be         studied play a central role in most applications of group theory to             real world problems.  Group membership is used to construct a solution,         minimum word algorithms correspond to the simplification of a solution,         and a change of basis represents a transformation of the group data             structure into a domain which is more suitable for improving time and           space utilization.  Applications are numerous.  Examples range from the         transporation problem in operations research to minimization of pin             count in VLSI.  Both algorithms and applications are being implemented          in the context of a unified environment which is engineered to support          experimentation with a variety of data structures and approaches.",
