 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Na/Ca exchange is a membrane bound mechanism responsible for                net Ca extrusion from the cells.  The importance of the Na/Ca                   exchange is evident from its ability to extrude large Ca loads;                 however, an additional fundamental aspect of this system results                from its capacity, under certain conditions, to work in \"reverse\"               facilitating the net Ca gain and the corresponding increase in                  the levels of ionized \u0131Ca! of the cell.  The relevance of this                  function is both physiological and pathological, for the                        intracellular Ca concentrations regulate cardiac muscle                         contraction and the contraction of the arterial musculature.                    Therefore, the understanding of the Na/Ca exchange function can                 provide insights into the mechanisms leading to the development                 of hypertension.  The present work intends to further                           characterize the Na/Ca exchanger in relation to the asymmetric                  properties of the carrier (different reactivity towards intra-                  and extracellular ligands).  The aim is to establish if that                    asymmetry is intrinsic to the system or a consequence of the                    different ionic and electrical environments surrounding the                     intra- and extracellular phases of the cell.  This analysis will                allow a comparison between data obtained in intact cells and in                 the membrane vesicles from isolated plasma membranes, widening                  the field of cellular and molecular research.",
