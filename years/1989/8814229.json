 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) is intended to be a                   decade long internationally coordinated program.  This proposal                 is a level-1 component of the U.S. contribution to a JGOFS                      study along longitude 20 w in the N. Atlantic to take place                     beginning in 1989.  Special interest in the North Atlantic as a                 candidate for GOFS first basin-scale effort arises because of                   the intensity and depth of winter mixing, which has major                       implication for biogeochemical processes in the global ocean.                   Significant episodes of vertical export from the Upper Ocean                    and deposition on the deep seafloor are associated with oceanic                 phytoplankton blooms in the North Atlantic.  Deep convection in                 this region, and the transport of biogenic matter (both                         particulate and dissolved) is of profound consequence for                       physical and biogeochemical properties and processes in the                     South Atlantic, Southern and Pacific Oceans.  In order to study                 the mechanisms regulating the bloom process, its fate, and the                  meridional variability in them, we propose a program with three                 components:  a line of mooring deployed along 20 degrees west                   latitude between 33 and 60 degrees North, seasonal transects                    along 20 degrees West, and three process-oriented cruises at                    33, 47, and 60 North.                                                                                                                                           This proposal is for support for the overall coordination of                    the process-oriented cruises, and for some of the level-1                       measurements which will take place on them.  A high degree of                   planning and coordination is required to ensure the success of                  these cruises which will be part of a series of cruises to the                  same areas by ships and scientists from the United kingdom,                     Germany and the Netherlands.  Furthermore coordination is                       required for enabling all related US GOFS projects  and PI's to                 contribute to this effort and derived maximum benefit from it.                  This proposal also seeks support for the following level-1                      measurements:  microbial biomass (transect and process                          cruises), plant pigments by HPLC and in vitro fluorometry, POC                  and PON, and DON (all on process cruises only).",
