 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one-year project will offer re-training opportunities                      for a number of uncertified middle school/high school                           chemistry teachers.  The project will utilize the skills of                     Master Teachers, including one or more National Science                         Foundation Presidential Awardees, selected from 15 school                       systems in Northern Louisiana.                                                                                                                                  During the academic year 1988-89, the Master Teachers, in                       conjunction with faculty from the Departments of Chemistry,                     and Science Education, will plan, develop, and field-test a                     resource handbook designed to aid all teachers of chemistry.                                                                                                    During the summer of 1989 chemistry course-work will be                         provided for 20 chemistry teachers in the fifteen systems.                      The selected participants will be teaching with temporary                       certificates or outside their area of certification.  The                       chemistry course will consist of two, four week sessions.                       Each four week session will involve daily class-meetings in                     the morning and two afternoon laboratory meetings each week.                    Participants will obtain a background in chemistry while at                     the same time accumulating materials, ideas, and experience                     that will enhance their skills as chemistry teachers.                                                                                                           During the fall of 1989 the Master Teachers, with the                           assistance of chemists from Louisiana Tech University, will                     serve as system level chemistry consultants.  Using the                         handbook as a base, three in-service programs will be offered                   in five sites in North Louisiana.                                                                                                                               Each participant will earn a total credits of 6 hours for                       lecture and 2 hours for laboratory, adding up to a total of                     eight credit hours of introductory chemistry for successful                     completion of the course.                                                                                                                                       This project offers the opportunity of studying the impact of                   a concentrated exposure to chemistry instruction on                             uncertified teachers                                                                                                                                            Louisiana Tech University has contributed an amount equal to                    41% of the National Science Foundation award.",
