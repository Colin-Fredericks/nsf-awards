 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovative Dynamics plans to investigate solid-state lasers to be               incorporated in a Laser-Acoustic System for remote sensing                      applications in the Arctic environment.  This system consists of a              pulsed laser transmitter and an acoustic receiver, both operated                in the air.  The laser beam in focused to a small spot on the                   surface of the ground.  Strong absorption of the laser energy at                the surface limits penetration of the beam to a few wavelengths.                Instant evaporation of surface molecules take place if the peak                 power density of the laser spot on the surface is sufficiently                  intense.  The superheated steam subsequently explodes, creating an              acoustic field which propagates through the medium and is                       reflected at the media interface.  An acoustic receiver detects                 the reflected sound from the interface.  Precise timing of these                signals makes it possible to accurately measure the thickness of                the given medium.  The reflections would also reveal                            characteristics of the medium.  Initial ice field measurements                  proved the feasibility of the concept for measuring 1 meter thick               ice using a CO2 laser operating in the infrared portion of the                  spectrum (10.6 um).  The emphasis of the proposed program is to                 determine the feasibility of using a Nd-Yag laser operating in the              near infrared region (1.06 um) to generate acoustic pulses in                   various media including water, ice, snow, and soil.  The results                of these experiments will yield important information as to the                 potential utility of airborne laser remote sensing for rapid and                wide scale measurement of spatial and temporal variations in snow,              ice, and frozen conditions.",
