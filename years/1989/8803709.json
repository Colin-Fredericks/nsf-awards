 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Terence G. Langdon,                  Materials Science Department, University of Southern California                 (USC), to pursue with Dr. Ho Chul Kim, Professor of Physics,                    Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), for                 24 months, a program of cooperative research on the application                 of nondestructive techniques to investigate cavitation in                       superplasticity.  The collaborators will use the excellent                      facilities at KAIST to perform nondestructive testing of samples                provided by the testing laboratory in the United States.                        Facilities of the type at KAIST are not available at USC.                                                                                                       Superplasticity refers to the ability of some metals to exhibit                 exceptionally high neck-free elongations, often in excess of                    1,000%, when pulled in tension at elevated temperatures.  This                  phenomenon is of considerable commerial interest because of the                 any potential applications in sheet-metal forming.  A major                     problem in superplasticity is the nucleation and growth of                      internal cavities.  These cavities may lead to a significant                    degradation of the post-forming properties of the material.  The                collaborators will attempt to obtain indirect information on                    cavity size as a function of both specimen history and testing                  procedures.  They also will attempt to correlate results of                     nondestructive testing at KAIST with parallel optical                           examination at USC.  The collaborators are highly respected                     scientists in the field of this research.  The present project                  will allow them to combine their talents and interests for                      mutual benefit. This project is relevant to the objectives of                   the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to                       increase the level of cooperative between U.S. and Korea                        scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific                     information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean                            participation in the project is supported by the Korea Science                  and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
