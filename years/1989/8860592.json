 "awd_abstract_narration": "The efficiencies of thermoelectric devices are generally limited                by the properties of the available materials.  This study will                  use ion beam modification to produce improved thermoelectric                    materials.  By introducing defects and/or alloying elements by                  ion implantation, the thermal conductivity of the materials will                be lowered without reducing the Seebeck coefficient or the                      electrical conductivity thus resulting in a higher figure of                    merit and making possible a higher efficiency in thermoelectric                 generators, coolers, etc.  In Phase I silicon-germanium alloys                  will be deposited in thin film form, doped by ion implantation,                 and the relevant electrical properties will be measured.  Phase                 II research would attempt to improve the figure of merit of the                 materials using ion implantation, resulting in an increase in the               theoretically attainable efficiency.  Since the applications of                 these devices indicate that their market will be international,                 this research would improve the nation's competitive position by                advancing the state of the art and ensuring that domestic firms                 would have access to the latest research results.",
