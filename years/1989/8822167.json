 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1931, Kurt Godel published an article which ended nearly a                   century of attempts to establish axioms which would provide a                   rigorous basis for all of mathematics.  He proved that within any               rigidly logical mathematical system, there are propositions that                cannot be proved or disproved on the basis of the axioms of that                system. Thus, the search for a demonstration of the self-                       consistency of mathematics was dealt a shattering blow.  If                     mathematics is actually consistent, Godel showed that the fact of               this consistency cannot be proved within the rules of mathematics               itself.  Mathematicians can never be certain that the basic                     axioms of arithmetic will not give rise to contradictions and                   the foundations of mathematics must ultimately always remain a                  mystery.  Godel went on from this brilliant start to make                       contributions which would profoundly affect logic, physics,                     philosophy, the foundations of computer science, and other                      aspects of the foundations of mathematics.  The purpose of this                 project is to publish the works of Kurt Godel and make them                     available to a wider audience of mathematicians, philosophers and               historians.                                                                                                                                                     Under previous NSF grants, Professor Feferman and his editorial                 staff have published the first volume of what is now projected to               be a four volume collection of the papers of the mathematician                  and logician, Kurt Godel.  Volume one contains Godel's collected                publications of 1929-1936.  Volume two, which is currently being                finished, contains his publications form 1936 to 1974.  Under                   this new grant, Godel's notes from his courses, letters,                        lectures, scientific notebooks and drafts of unpublished                        manuscripts will be prepared for publication.  These papers will                be published in an additional two volumes. The editorial work                   includes translations of many documents from the German to                      English and the preparation of introductions and notes to the                   documents in order to make these materials of maximum scientific,               historical and philosophical significance.",
