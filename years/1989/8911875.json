 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a neglected but crucial area of research                 in the theory of strategic dynamics, i.e., renegotiation in                     repeated games.  Renegotiation and bargaining power are combined                in a unified, coherent theory.  Much of the project is concerned                with providing clean characterizations which make the theory                    tractable in applied economic problems.  Both the formulation of                the appropriate definitions and the characterizations become                    progressively more challenging as more complicated supergames are               studied.  The project gives definitions and conjectured results                 for asymmetric strictly repeated games and for some dynamic and                 stochastic games.                                                                                                                                               This is extremely important research because it corrects a major                flaw in models of repeated games and repeated game models are                   widely used in macro theory, industrial organization,                           international trade and many other areas of economic theory.  The               validity of repeated game models depend on the credibility of the               agreements reached by the players.  If players think they can                   escape punishment for violating agreements by renegotiating the                 agreement after they violate it, then they no longer have an                    incentive to abide by the agreements.  Therefore, a model of                    repeated games without a theory of renegotiation is flawed                      because many different outcomes other than the one agreed upon                  are possible.",
