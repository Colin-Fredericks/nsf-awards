 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the molecular mechanism involved in               the differential expression of the multigene family members for                 the small subunit (SSU) of ribulose.1, 5.bisphosphate carboxylase               (rbcS genes) using tomato as a model system.  Tomato has five                   rbcs genes rbcS.1, rbcS.2, rbcS.3A and rbcS.3C, which encode                    three iso.variant SSU proteins.  The five rbcS genes are                        differentially transcribed in cotyledons, leaves and fruit.                     Several 5' DNA sequences which are functionally undefined are                   conserved among the five tomato rbcS genes which share similar                  developmental and organ.specific expression pattern.  In                        addition, mRNAs from the individual tomato rbcS genes accumulate                to substantially different levels in different tissues, but this                pattern is not reflected in the accumulation of the three iso.                  variant SSU proteins.  We will examine rbcS cis.acting DNA                      regions to define their role in the developmental and organ.                    specific on.off control of transcription and examine how they                   interact.  We will identify protein.binding domains by DNasel                   footprint analysis to determine if the differential transcription               of the rbcS genes is correlated with differences in the DNA:                    protein binding pattern of 5' DNA fragments.  This will                         complement our analysis of cis.acting DNA sequences in transgenic               plants and transient assays.  Furthermore, transcription run.on                 assays and quantitative hybridizations will be used to assess the               extent to which transcriptional regulation of the five rbcS genes               establishes the relative levels of their mRNAs.  At the                         translational level, we will test if variations in the length of                the rbcS 5' untranslated regions result in the differential                     accumulation of iso.variant SSU proteins.  To attain further                    information on the role of differential rbcS express in fruit, we               will take advantage of a fruit.specific promoter for the                        production of antisense.RNA to block rbcS.1 and rbcS.2                          expression.  Finally, we will activate the normally inactive                    rbcS.3A gene to produce the iso.variant 3 SSU protein in fruit to               determine what effect, if any, this has on organ development.                                                                                                   Developmental, organ.specific and light.dependent regulation of                 transcription and translation are important control steps in the                expression of nuclear genes encoding photosynthetic proteins                    found in the chloroplasts of higher plants.  The results of this                study should provide greater insights into those processes.",
