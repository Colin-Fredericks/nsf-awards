 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Associative learning\" is a basic learning process in which                     animals (including humans) learn to associate different events or               concepts.  Dr. Bouton studies it in animal conditioning                         experiments in which rats learn that one stimulus, such as a tone               or a light, is associated with the occurrence of another                        stimulus, such as a food pellet or a mild foot-shock.  This                     project will study how the retrieval of associations already                    stored in memory can influence learning and behavior in such                    situations.                                                                                                                                                     Dr. Bouton's previous research indicates that the \"context,\" the                stimuli present in the background whenever learning and                         remembering occur, is crucial in the retrieval of stored                        associations.  It also suggests that retrieval of old memories by               the context is especially important when an animal is learning,                 or has recently learned, a conflicting association.  Such                       conflict is present when therapists treat human anxiety                         disorders; new learning is usually introduced to conflict with                  old.  One implication of Dr. Bouton's research is that the older                memory is not destroyed by conflict; its retrieval after therapy                may cause relapse.                                                                                                                                              A series of experiments with rats will examine the role of                      context in a variety of learning situations.  An important goal                 is to develop and test a general new theory that will integrate                 research on different learning and memory phenomena in both                     animals and humans.  Another goal is to compare and integrate the               effects of \"contexts\" provided by the physical environment (e.g.,               features of the room), by the passage of time, and by the                       occurrence of other recent events.  The work will provide new                   insight into the basic mechanisms of associative learning and                   memory, and will have implications for the control and treatment                of human emotional disorders.",
