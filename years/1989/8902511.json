 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) scheme of languages                      provides a framework for reasoning with symbolic and numerical                  constraints and for linking these methods of computation.  It                   also provides a method for tailoring constraint logic programming               languages for specific applications.  The research plan includes:               (1) to implement sequential and parallel versions of a canonical                for algorithm developed by Lassez and McAloon for solving and                   maintaining systems of constraints and rules, (2) to work on                    constraint solving techniques for use in implementations of                     CLP(R) and other constraint logic programming languages, (3) to                 embed this work in the inference and constraint solving engines                 of a CLP language called 2LP specifically intended for                          application to constraint based reasoning and to mixed integer                  linear optimization problems, (4) to work on a sequent calculus                 approach to reasoning with constraints, on canonical forms in a                 general setting and on computational complexity issues.  This                   research can lead to new intelligent systems for dealing with                   applications classically handled by mixed integer linear                        programming in the areas of financial applications or resource                  management and to development of user friendly general purpose                  applications software for constraints and optimization.",
