 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to identify and characterize                   organisms that can dehalogenate organic substances that are                     present in soil, water and wastewater.  Research involves                       determination of the metabolic pathways by which organisms                      accomplish dehalogenation, reaction rates and metabolic end                     products.  The investigators plan to isolate the enzyme(s)                      responsible for dehalogenation and establish the chemical                       mechanisms by which they accomplish this.                                                                                                                       The engineering goals to which this project is responsive                       relates to the development of processes and methods for                         removing alkyl halide pollutants from locations where they                      constitute a threat to water, land and soil quality.  Concepts                  toward which this research is directed may constitute the basis                 for engineering design of systems to decontaminate                              environmental resources.",
