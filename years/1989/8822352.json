 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past two decades, several important reforms of                         America's public and private child support systems have been                    debated, and some successfully implemented, particularly at the                 state level.  These reforms make a striking difference in the                   ways the costs and benefits of child-rearing are shared between                 parents and between parents and governments.  By increasing the                 effectiveness of collection systems, the reforms in the child                   support systems seek to partially shift costs from mothers and                  governments to fathers.  Some states are also experimenting                     with a publicly-assured child support benefit.  But why do some                 states adopt innovations in child support and not others?  What                 explains differences in the character of child support policy                   across states?  This project addresses these two issues through                 a comparative analysis of four states that have been among the                  key innovators in the child support area: California, New York,                 Texas, and Wisconsin.   This analysis will be supplemented by                   comparisons with several states where child support reform has                  not occurred.  Both sets of comparisons will be structured by                   hypotheses drawn from studies of the welfare state.  A                          consideration of federal child support policy developments will                 provide an understanding of the context within which state                      reform initiatives take place.  This study will offer an                        explanation for innovation and the specific policy content of                   the four states on the cutting edge of innovation.  It will                     also contribute to our understanding of welfare policy, by                      exploring the relationship between gender and social policy, an                 area of social-scientific analysis which is attracting new                      attention.  Given the growing numbers of mother-only families                   and the scholarly interest in social policy, this project                       should offer insights about child support policy of interest to                 citizens and social scientists alike.",
