 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry                      Program, is designed to investigate the mechanisms of                           oscillating chemical reactions. This work is expected to lead                   to new insights into the basic dynamics of oscillating                          reactions as well as the chemistry of the systems involved.                     Information will also be obtained about the aqueous sulfur                      chemistry which is of environmental and industrial importance.                                                                                                  The first chemical oscillator to be investigated is the                         methylene-blue-catalyzed oxidation of sulfur-containing ions by                 oxygen in a continuous-flow, stirred tank reactor. A major role                 will be to sort out the importance in this system of kinetic                    nonlinearities related to autocatalysis and/or inhibition. In                   addition, the mechanism of both catalyzed and uncatalyzed                       bromine-ion-driven oscillators will be examined. An attempt                     will be made to interpret the well-documented appearance of                     aperiodicity in stirred tank reactors in terms of coupling                      between areas of different composition in the reactor resulting                 from imperfect mixing.",
