 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research are:  (1) to investigate the                    transport kinetics of anions and cations in single erythroblastic               cells at various stages of maturation by means of cryosectioning                and x-ray microanalysis, and (2) to demonstrate the applicability               of these techniques in studying transport of materials labeled                  with identifiable elements such as bromine or iodine in a                       multicompartment system.  Investigation of membrane transport of                erythroid cells is complicated by the heterogeneity of the cell                 population.  Without physical separation of the cells into                      distinct homogeneous populations conventional methods for                       measuring transport cannot be applied.  The techniques of                       cryomicrotomy and x-ray microanalysis provide a solution to this                problem.  They will be used to study rubidium and bromide uptake                as well as changes in potassium and sodium concentrations in dog,               sheep, and rabbit erythroid cells at various stages of                          maturation.  The different species of animals selected are                      distinct in their red cell membrane transport properties.  The                  stage of maturation of the cells will be identified either                      morphologically or from the amount of iron (i.e. hemoglobin)                    present.  Pump/leak as well as co-transport and counter-transport               systems will be examined by multielemental analysis and with the                aid of inhibitors such as ouabain, furosemide, bumetanide, DIDS,                and SITS.  Changes in surface to volume ratios of the cells will                be determined by stereological techniques and the contribution of               these changes to uptake will be examined.  In addition, x-ray                   microanalysis will be applied to examine the intracellular                      distribution of model iodine or bromine labeled compounds in                    order to test the feasibility of using this technique for                       studying transport, distribution and targeting of other materials               in general.                                                                          The techniques of rapidly freezing cells, cutting frozen                   thin sections, and studying their elemental content using x-ray                 microanalysis provides a unique approach to the study of the                    transport and compartmentation of inorganic ions and small                      molecules in cells.   This procedure permits simultaneous                       quantitative analysis of their elemental content and study of                   their morphology so that the transport properties of individual                 cell types in a mixed population can be deduced from very small                 samples.  This research has already provided new insights into                  the development of transport processes in maturing red blood                    cells.  Extension of this technique to study of the distribution                in cells of model compounds labeled with identifiable tracer                    elements will have many potential applications in basic and                     applied research.",
