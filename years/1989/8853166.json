The award will provide one-half of the funds               needed to acquire a digital image processing system. The                        University is committed to matching the NSF contribution for this               equipment.                                                                           The equipment will be used in the University's undergraduate               geoscience courses from the introductory to the senior research                 projects level in order to make possible student access to the                  University's considerable research library resources of digital                 data. Images for analysis and study will be drawn from sources                  such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper, SIR-B Shuttle imaging radar,               SPOT satellite imagery, COCORP reflection profiles of the U.S.                  continental crust, and various other gravity, topography and                    seismicity digitized data sets. The library provides a rich                     source of images of landforms and earth-interior geophysical                    information for illustrating structures in introductory courses                 and for problem solving exercises based on real examples for more               advanced courses.",
