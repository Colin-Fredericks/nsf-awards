 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to design efficient algorithms for graph         optimization, recognition, and isomorphism problems.                               The research focuses on two large classes of graphs: perfect graphs          and intersection graphs.  Techniques are drawn primarily from graph             theory, design of algorithms and computational geometry.  Experience            has shown that many problems possess some mutual underlying properties.         The approach of this project in analyzing a problem is to consider              various representations of the graphs in interest and to develop                decomposition or reduction schemes for identifying the core of the              problem.  The intent is either to conclude that most solvable cases of          the problem adopts some well-known techniques in a disguised manner or          to discover genuinely new algorithms.",
