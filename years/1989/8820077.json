 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to experimentally simulate the flame-          flow interactions encountered in turbulent combustion with a carefully          controlled, rotating laminar flame undergoing various degrees of                stretch.  Opposed jet and stagnation point flows have been chosen               because of their accessibility and two-dimensionality.  Temperature,            concentration, and velocity will be measured in reacting and                    unreacting environments, and the structure of secondary flows induced           by rotation as well as resonance phenomena previously identified will           be explored.  Supporting experiments will be performed at the                   Combustion Research Facility of the Sandia National Laboratory,                 Livermore.                                                                                                                                                      Combustion in devices of practical application invariably involves              turbulent flow in geometries not amenable to temporal measurement of            the important scaler and velocity fields.  Numerical predictions of             the system performance require an understanding of the flame quenching          and propagation processes that occur within the localized turbulent             structures.  Successful simulation of this complex phenomena through            the proposed simple experiments will substantially contribute to our            understanding.",
