 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of nuclear magnetic resonance                     (NMR) spectroscopy. This research is designed to study the                      utility of combining magic angle spinning (MAS) of dilute spins                 like carbon-13 with the sensitivity of abundant spins like                      protons by spatial localization methods combined with                           high-power cross-polarization and proton decoupling. It is                      further proposed that the use of an appropriate pulse sequence,                 in combination with an rf gradient, should permit rare spin NMR                 spectra of localized regions of a given sample. Thus, the                       overall goal of this research is to obtain chemical information                 from an NMR spectrum  within a selected region of a sample.                     Such an approach should have applications in many areas of                      chemical research including 1) organic solids and polymers, 2)                  reactions at interfaces, 3) isotopically labeled molecules                      doped into porous materials, 4) layered materials, and                          5) devices subject to defects cracks or other imperfections.                                                                                                    This five year continuing grant to the University of California                 at Irvine for the support of Professor Shaka as a Presidential                  Young Investigator is designed to promote his rapid and                         effective growth as an independent researcher in the area of                    solid state NMR spectroscopy.",
