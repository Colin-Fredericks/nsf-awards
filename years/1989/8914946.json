Robert Blumenschine and Fidelis Masao will conduct                         exploratory paleoanthropological research at the site of Olduvai                Gorge in Northern Tanzania to test a series of survey and                       analytic techniques.  They wish to determine whether it is                      possible to distinguish materials in primary undisturbed context                from those which have been eroded from elsewhere, higher up the                 stratigraphic sequence, and then redeposited and reburied.  They                will use three techniques - broad scale surface collection,                     intensive surface collection from squares of different size, and                finally, controlled excavation - to collect series of animal                    bones and stone tools.  These then will be analyzed and compared.                                                                                               The Olduvai Gorge provides crucial evidence on the development of               humans because its strata contain archaeological materials which                span almost two million years.  Although much                                   paleoanthropological research has been conducted at the Gorge, it               has focussed, for the most part, on \"sites\" or dense                            concentrations of lithic and faunal remains.  This has provided a               biased picture of the prehistoric landscape and how early humans                fit into it.  Archaeologists have come to realize that to provide               a balanced picture, areas of medium and low artifact density                    should be examined as well.  At Olduvai, however, this may be                   difficult or impossible to do.  Because the Gorge is so steep,                  materials tend to be eroded from their primary context and                      carried downward.  To acquire distributional data which will shed               light on human behavior, it is necessary to separate derived from               in situ materials.  Drs. Blumenschine's and Masao's work will                   show whether, in fact, this can be done.                                                                                                                        This research is important for several reasons.  It will,                       hopefully, serve to develop and test analytic techniques which                  will be applicable in many archaeological situations.  It will                  set the stage for a larger research project and may, in itself,                 increase our understanding of this important site.  Since one                   investigator is American and the other Tanzanian, it will also                  foster scientific cooperation between these two countries.",
