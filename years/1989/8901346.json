 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout much of recorded history, people have been                      fascinated by the intricate and often brightly-colored patterns                 displayed by birds.  In recent years, evolutionary biologists                   have reconsidered the importance that mate choice can have in                   causing the evolution of these patterns.  In this project the PIs               will investigate two types of mate preferences (\"adaptive\" and                  \"aesthetic\") that may lead to bright coloration and the commonly                observed tendency for males to be more brightly colored than                    females.  Female animals (and sometimes males) are often thought                to choose their mates based on adaptive traits such as state of                 health or the ability to be good parents; possibly bright                       coloration may be indicative of mating quality.  In addition, it                has been suggested since Darwin's time the female birds have                    aesthetic mate preferences, preferring \"good-looking\" males that                in turn produce \"good-looking\" sons.                                                 In this research the PIs will use the zebra finch, a small                 bird native to Australia, to study the significance of sex                      differences in beak color (males' beaks are redder than females')               and preferences for beak color.  Females prefer to mate with                    males with very red beaks.  Experiments will be performed to                    determine if beak color is an adaptive or aesthetic criterion of                mate choice.  For example, do males with the most red beaks make                better fathers?  Do their offspring grow at faster rates?  Males                do not prefer females with red beaks, although females with red                 beaks do occur both in nature and the lab.  The investigators                   will explore the possibility that this results from genetic                     constraints that may cause female beaks to evolve to be redder                  than optimal and male beaks to be less red than optimal.  The                   long-term goal is to elucidate the components of mate choice for                animals in general and to understand how mate choice influences                 evolution species' appearance.",
