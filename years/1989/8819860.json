 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of                  Chicago supports interactive and interdisciplinary materials                    research, primarily in the condensed matter sciences, organized                 into three principal thrust areas.  There is a strong emphasis                  throughout on collaborative research between experimentalists and               theorists.  The surface dynamics thrust includes research on                    adparticle dynamics and surface reactivity, and on surface phonon               spectroscopy and overlayer dynamics.  The thrust on disordered                  materials includes work on lower dimensional disorder a variety                 of systems, glassiness and glassy dynamics, and order-disorder                  and structure in oxides.  Research on dynamical patterns and                    solidification has developed into a third major thrust area in                  the last few years.  It addresses the dynamics of pattern                       formation and dynamical evolution at liquid-liquid and liquid-                  solid interfaces and in simple dynamical systems where the work                 is concerned with the analysis of fractal attractors generated at               the onset of chaos in convective flow.                                            The MRL also provides seed funding for new faculty and high-                  risk research, and supports continuing research in high-                        resolution analytical microscopy related to several other areas                 of the overall program.  Funding is also provided for the                       development, operation and maintenance of central research                      facilities.  The program currently involves 21 faculty members, 5               professionals, 23 graduate students, and 6 students in \"Research                Experience for Undergraduates.\"  The University of Chicago MRL is               directed by Professor Sidney R. Nagel.",
