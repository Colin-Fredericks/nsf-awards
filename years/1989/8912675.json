 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for                   the determination of the molecular structure of compounds as                    diverse as small polypeptides and complex metal clusters.  When                 combined with the latest computer software, the technique is                    becoming remarkably easy to put into practice.  Access to X-ray                 crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the ability                  of chemists to carry out frontier research.                                                                                                                     The Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming will                   use this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to                     help acquire an automated X-ray diffractometer.  The areas of                   chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are                  as follows:                                                                                                                                                     1) Design and synthesis of binuclear manganese complexes                        2) Design and synthesis of new inorganic clusters                               3) Ligation properties of chelating fluoroalkylphosphines                       4) Asymmetric alkylation of carbamate alpha-oxocarbanions                       5) Vesicles derived from cleavable double-chain surfactant-                        based vesicles                                                               6) Photooxidation of sulfur-containing protein.",
