 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade, one of the most significant developments                in the scientific study of law is work at the intersection of law               and economics.  Among those who have contributed to this area,                  Dr. Bebchuk is among the most respected for his innovative work                 and productivity.  Under this project, Dr. Bebchuk plans to                     continue and extend his theoretical research on the economic                    analysis of law to a set of problems where economic principles                  can generate new knowledge about the effects of legal rules and                 the nature of law-related relations.                                                                                                                            Six problems will be addressed.  Four of the projects are in the                area of corporate law.  The first concerns the rules that govern                sale of control transactions in which a control block is sold by                an existing controlling shareholder to a new controller.  The                   second analyzes the effects of insider trading on managerial                    behavior.  The third concerns the rules that establish managerial               control over corporate agenda by prescribing that only the board                of directors can initiate a shareholder vote on proposals for                   charter amendments and certain structural changes.  The fourth                  examines the rules governing the allocation of the expenses                     incurred by contenders in proxy contests for corporate control.                 The research also includes two projects in the areas of                         litigation and contracts.  One analyzes the effects of formal                   offer rules on the settlement terms reached by parties.  The                    second concerns the classic contract rule of \"interpretation                    against the draftsman,\" which is applied whenever a contract                    drafted by one of the parties to the contract is ambiguous on an                issue.                                                                                                                                                          Dr. Bebchuk is performing an important role in cross-fertilizing                thought in law and economics about takeovers, insider trading,                  and corporate control.  All of the topics are addressed to                      important, yet neglected scientific issues.  All examine a legal                rule or practice with great significance.  The research could                   lead to the reexamination of (or confirmation of) legal rules                   that have very substantial economic impact.",
