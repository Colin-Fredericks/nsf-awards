The conference will be held December 15-18, 1988 at                   Ohio State University and is under the direction of Professor                   Harvey Friedman.  Invited speakers are from mathematics,                        philosophy, psychology, and computer science.  The mix of invited               speakers is expected to be approximately three each from the                    areas of proof theory, nonstandard logics, axiomatic algebra and                geometry, measurement theory, decision theory and probability                   theory, software verification, database systems, and proof                      checking and theorem proving.                                                                                                                                        Axiomatic systems are developed, studied, and used by                      researchers from many academic disciplines such as mathematics,                 computer science, psychology, and philosophy.  This conference                  will bring together representatives of each of these fields with                the aim of laying new lines of interdisciplinary research and                   establishing new and useful contacts among colleagues from                      related areas.",
