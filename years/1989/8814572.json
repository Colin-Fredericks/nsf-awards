The                     conference will be under the direction of Professor Thomas Kurtz                and will be conducted under the auspices of the Bernoulli Society               of the International Statistics Institute.  Previous conferences                in this series have been held in twelve different countries.  The               primary purpose of the conference will be to foster an active                   exchange of ideas among a diverse, international group of                       researchers from all areas of stochastic processes and their                    applications.  The areas of specialization of the invited                       speakers include probability and statistics, operations research,               stochastic flows, Brownian excursions, filtering, stochastic                    networks, Brownian sample paths, percolation and random graphs,                 stochastic analysis, random media, statistical physics, empirical               processes, and particle systems.                                                     This conference was designed to provide an overview of                     current research in applied and pure probability, to bring                      together distinguished scholars from all over the world, and to                 feature younger scientists who will help shape future directions                of the field.  The list of invited speakers includes scientists                 from the United States, France, the USSR, the United Kingdom,                   Canada, Brazil, and Japan.  Some support will be available for                  participants, particularly graduate students and junior faculty                 members.",
