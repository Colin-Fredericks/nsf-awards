 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many organizations have found that they have high cost                     investments in software systems that are vital to their                         operations but which they cannot adapt to their current needs.                  Their ability to compete has become limited by their existing                   software.  Improved methodologies for re-engineering large                      software systems would have major economic benefits.                                 Typical software re-engineering tasks include:                                                                                                                       .  re-structuring a system of 'old code' to conform to                             modern software engineering standards                                                                                                                        .  porting from one computer, operating system,                                    programming language or data-base to another                                                                                                                 .  enhancing a system to add major new functions                                                                                                           The prime focus of the research will be to define                          methodologies for understanding persistent data in large                        transaction processing software systems.  An understanding of the               purpose and utilization of the data that a system stores for                    relatively long periods of time is a key to many kinds of                       software modification.  The principal investigator will work with               a company that has extensive practical experience in the design,                construction and modification of real-world transaction                         processing systems.  If possible, case studies will be made of a                small number of actual re-engineering activities to clarify needs               and to evaluate the applicability of the methodologies developed.                    The principal investigator is well-qualified to pursue this                research and a grant is highly recommended.",
