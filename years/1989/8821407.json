 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last two decades, several theories have emerged to                     account for the social distribution of criminal victimization.                  Testing these theories is important to advancing our                            understanding of crime.  In addition, public policy regarding                   crime control also depends on the validity of victimization                     theories.  For example, citizen-initiated crime prevention                      activities such as private security systems and neighborhood                    block watch are based on assumptions about the causes of crime                  and the spatial distribution of crime and victimization.                        Unfortunately, limitations of existing data preclude systematic                 study of competing victimization theories and the utility of                    various crime control activities.                                                                                                                               This project is designed to overcome the limitations of previous                victimization studies by collecting and compiling multiple                      sources of data (e.g. census, archival, police reports,                         telephone survey, field observation) on 5400 residents of 90                    neighborhoods in a single city.  These data will be used to                     describe changes in each neighborhood over time, test the                       predictive accuracy of a structural-choice theory of criminal                   victimization at various levels of analysis (i.e., neighborhoods,               streets, and individuals), and examine whether individuals                      benefit from the crime control activity of their neighbors.                     Multivariate modeling approaches permit examining a range of                    issues, including whether a displacement or free rider effect                   best characterizes the impact of crime control activity on                      individuals' risks of victimization.                                                                                                                            This study will result in a comprehensive data collection on                    victimization, social control measures, and routine activities                  and lifestyles.  No previous study has collected data on such                   issues that have a sufficient number of observations for multi-                 level analyses, include multiple measures of theoretically                      relevant variables, involve several modes of observation, and                   simultaneously consider individual and group processes.  Through                the examination of multiple primary and secondary data sources,                 the research will provide a unique opportunity to evaluate                      current victimization theories and the crime-reduction benefits                 of crime control measures.  The results should have an impact on                theories of social change and victimization as well as on                       programmatic strategies for crime reduction.",
