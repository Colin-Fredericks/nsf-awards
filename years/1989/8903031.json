 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two related lines of investigation will be carried out in                  this project of mathematical research.  The work is basically                   geometric in spirit, focusing (i) on a study of general extremal                problems for normalized univalent holomorphic functions in the                  exterior of a circle and (ii) on the analysis of complex-valued                 orientation preserving harmonic planar mappings.                                     In the first instance, work will continue on efforts to                    describe the omitted set in the range of a solution of a linear                 extremal problem for the functions defined and univalent in the                 exterior of a disc.  The omitted set is known to consist of                     finitely many analytic arcs lying on the trajectories of                        aquadratic differential.  The structure of these sets remains                   elusive except in cases where the extremals were known                          beforehand.  Some newly developed second variational techniques                 will be applied to specific extremal questions.                                      The study of harmonic maps derives from fundamental                        questions about nonparametric minimal surfaces in                               three-dimensional space.  The coordinate functions in their                     representation are harmonic and the first two such functions give               rise to univalent maps of the domain onto itself.  The extremal                 problems arising in this context have been much harder to work                  with because of the lack of any variational principles within the               admissible class of mappings.  One approach to this question is                 to write the mappings as solutions of complex differential                      equations involving a functional parameter.  It is expected that                by varying this function, one should be able to recognize how                   extremal maps develop.  Emphasis will be placed on mappings from                a disc to itself.",
