 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS) is a key regulatory enzyme                    in the pathway of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis.                       Because these amino acids constitute about 25% of the dry                       weight of protein in living tissue, this pathway is of                          quantitative significance in many microorganisms and plants.                    The AHAS from a methane-producing archaebacterium,                              Methanococcus aeolicus, is being purified by standard                           techniques, and its chemical and physical properties                            determined.  The gene(s) for this enzyme is being cloned and                    DNA sequencing begun.  A number of major questions are                          addressed by this research.  Are anabolic enzymes in                            archaebacteria homologous to the eubacterial and eucaryotic                     enzymes?  Is the archaebacterial AHAS homologous to any                         pyruvate-utilizing enzymes found in catabolic pathways                          including the pyruvate oxidase from Escherichia coli?  Are                      the flavin and herbicide binding sites conserved in AHASs                       from diverse origins?%%%                                                                                                                                        Methanogenic bacteria are an economically important group                       belonging to the third major kingdom of life, the                               archaebacteria.  They catalyze the last step in the anaerobic                   decomposition of organic matter where 95% of the combustion                     energy is conserved in the methane formed.  Complex                             biological polymers can be converted to methane, a clean fuel                   already in wide use.  Therefore, there is great potential for                   exploitation of this fermentation in waste treatment.                           Furthermore, methane is the second most abundant carbon-                        containing gas in the atmosphere.  Its concentration has been                   increasing for the last several hundred years and may                           contribute to the greenhouse effect and global warming.  Thus                   these microorganisms are intimately associated with major                       global processes of our planet.  These studies on methanogen                    physiology and regulation will facilitate their exploitation                    for useful purposes and help gauge environmental                                practices.***//",
