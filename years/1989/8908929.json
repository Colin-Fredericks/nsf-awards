 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ROW Career Advancement Award will examine the regulation of                three interesting sporulation loci in Bacillus.  These loci                     either produce or modify new factors that allow changes in RNA                  polymerase specificity and transcription of genes involved in the               temporally and morphologically regulated sporulation process.                   The investigator will explore the structure and function of these               genes by asking:  1) Are these pivotal genes found in two                       distantly-related spore-forming species?  2) If so, how                         homologous are they?  3) Are the genes also regulated similarly?                4) Do these genes direct transcription of similar genes?                        Priority will be given to the genes that prove to be the most                   interesting during the comparative studies.  This research is                   important as sporulation in bacteria is the simplest cell                       differention process known and is being used as a model system to               begin to understand the expression and regulation of genes                      involved in temporal and morphological cell changes.",
