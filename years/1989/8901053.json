 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on developing techniques for space multiplexing           on an optical bus, which supports parallel transmission of messages.            Based on previous results on a distributed control mechanism and its            analysis of worst-case performance, research is being carried out on a          extensive simulation study for analyzing the average bus performance            under realistic assumptions regarding load, traffic patterns and memory         contention.  A technique called coincident pulse selection and                  developed by the principal investigators is being studied for the               optical bus architecture.  Comparisons to well-known multiprocessor             interconnection structures and the impact on fundamental parallel               algorithms are being carried out.                                                                                                                               The gradual maturity of electro-optic device technology has made                possible the construction of electronic-optical computers.  The                 interconnection network is an important component in conventional               multiprocessor system and is often a bottleneck in performance.  The            exploratory study on applying optical technologies to the design of             multiprocessor interconnection network will have significant payoff and         impact in the future.  Results developed may lead to new architectures          and algorithms in computer systems.  Support of this innovative                 exploratory research is strongly recommended.",
