 "awd_abstract_narration": "High temperature proton conductors are solid state materials which are          of interest because they can be used in heterogeneous catalysis in              order to modify electrochemically the rates of hydro- and                       dehydrogenation reactions.  Many such materials exist but few are of            real engineering interest because they also need to have high                   electrical conductivity and mechanical strength.  Such materials may            be used in an electrolyte cell in the following configuration:  Two             porous metal film electrodes are deposited on the two sides of a disk           made of a proton conducting material.  One side is exposed to a                 hydrogen containing gas and serves as the anodic electrode while the            other side (cathode) is exposed to a compound that can be hydrogenated          via an exothermic chemical reaction.  When placed in an electrical              circuit, a proton flux is established and hydrogen is transferred from          anode to cathode.  Hydrogen reacts on the cathode while the electrical          circuit converts the reaction free energy into electricity.  Hence a            useful chemical can be produced with simultaneous generation of                 electrical energy.                                                                                                                                              The PI plans to test the proton conductor SrCe.95 Yb.05O3-a in such             cells to produce ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen and C2                      hydrocarbons (e.g. ethylene) from methane while simultaneously                  cogenerating electricity.",
