 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine how  two mutant enzyme variants,                found in natural populations, influence an important metabolic                  pathway.  As a model system the study focuses on the enzyme                     glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in the fruit fly,                      Drosophila melanogaster.  Prior studies have indicated                          significant differences in biochemical properties, but it is                    unclear that these differences as determined in the test tube in                vitro reflect how the genetic variants function in the living                   fly (in vivo).  This question will be addressed by examining the                amount of radioactively labelled glucose passed through the                     metabolic pathway in flies possessing either genetic variant of                 the enzyme.                                                                          This test is essential to our understanding of naturally                   occurring enzyme variation because it is usually assumed that                   there is a one-to-one correspondence between artificial in vitro                measures of biochemical function and their function in vivo.                    However, no direct experiments have ever been conducted to test                 this assumption.  This is the crucial experimental examination of               that assumption in one of the very few systems where it may be                  directly tested.",
