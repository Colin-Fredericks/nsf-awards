 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will offer 24 high school juniors and seniors a research           oriented, three week summer program using as its central theme, Our             Nutritional Environment.  Students will select non-commercial plants and        invertebrate animals from the local area and determine the role of these        organisms in their community and their nutritional value.  The                  sociological and philosophical implications of science in general and           this type of research in particular will be presented as a continuous           and interwoven component.  Completion of this program will provide the          participants with a complete research experience, starting with the             development of a research proposal and continuing through collection of         data, forming conclusions, and preparing research results for a                 scientific audience.  The final product is presentation or publication          of a paper.  The research project will be undertaken and completed i the        context of ethical and social awareness.  Providing the participants            with cognizance of their potential as scientists and the many careers           available to scientists will be an additional outcome.",
