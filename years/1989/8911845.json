 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to define and analyze the functional regions of                      the ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) through a new molecular genetic                      approach in the model organism Tetrahymena thermophila.                         Although the rRNAs are extensively studied, very little is                      known about their specific roles in protein synthesis or                        other cellular activities.  The ciliate Tetrahymena is unique                   among eukaryotes and eubacteria in containing a single                          germline copy of the rRNA genes (rDNA).  In addition, we have                   recently developed a transformation method to replace the                       functional somatic copies of the rDNA with injected, cloned                     copies.  These two properties combined makes Tetrahymena an                     ideal organism for the genetic analysis of the rRNA.  We will                   construct rDNA clones with specific oligonucleotide                             insertions and substitutions at 76 positions of the                             transcribed region, and determine the effect of these                           mutations by transformation and gene replacement.  This study                   should help us define the functional regions of the rRNAs.                      We will also characterize the putative peptidyl transferase                     center of the 23S-like rRNA by constructing and analyzing                       specific single nucleotide substitutions in this region.                        Through this analysis we hope to understand the mechanism                       through which this RNA sequence affects translation.  We will                   also attempt to construct rRNAs with specific temperature-                      sensitive defects to facilitate future studies.  This will be                   accomplished by inserting modified versions of an RNA                           sequence possessing self-cleavage activities (e.g. a segment                    of the plant virus vLTSV RNA) into various sites of the rDNA,                   and look for clones which confer temperature-sensitive growth                   defects as the result of rRNA cleavage.  Mutations of this                      type could help us link specific rRNA regions to particular                     steps in protein synthesis or other cellular functions.                                                                                                         The unique characteristics of this system should allow Dr.                      Yao to specifically correlate ribosomal structure to                            ribosomal function for the first time.  Although ribosomes                      have been recognized as the cellular site for translation of                    mRNA into protein, little is known about the mechanism                          utilized by the ribosome to achieve this.  This system                          promises to illuminate the actual mechanisms involved.",
