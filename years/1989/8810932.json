 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will use the Nitrite reductase enzyme (NiR) as                   an indicator of in situ denitrification.  The hypothesis that                   induction of NiR is related to initiation of denitrification in                 low oxygen regimes will be investigated in continuous culture                   experiments.  This work will develop a set of tools for                         measurement of species specific growth rates and investigation                  of the in situ distribution of: 1) denitrifying bacteria,                       2) NiR among cells of known denitrifying strains and among the                  total bacterial population, and 3) the genetic potential for                    denitrification.  Assays for enumeration of denitrifiers, for                   NiR in bulk samples and inside whole cells, probes for the NiR                  gene and specific probes for denitrifier ribosomal RNA and                      ribosomal RNA genes are described.                                                   Denitrification is a process in which simple inorganic                     compounds of nitrogen dissolved in water are converted to                       dinitrogen gas such as makes up most of our atmosphere.  This                   process is carried out by bacteria and is ubiquitous in both                    soil and water environments.  One important consequence of                      Denitrication in the water column accounts for about half the                   annual loss of fixed nitrogen from the marine environment.                      Little is known of the taxonomic and metabolic diversity of                     marine nitrifying bacteria, but by analogy to terrestrial                       systems, marine denitrifiers are probably a diverse and                         successful group.  This study involves the application of state                 of the art immunological and molecular probes to examine the                    physical and community distribution, as well as the potential                   for the production of, a key enzyme in the denitrification                      pathway-Nitrite Reductase.  The objective of these advanced                     molecular biological techniques is to increase our understand-                  ing of marine denitrification, a problem that has been                          resistent to the application of more conventional oceanographic                 methods.",
