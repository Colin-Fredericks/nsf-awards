 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of the University of               Arkansas is the process of initiating an undergraduate degree                   program in biochemistry.  A major component of this new degree                  program is the creation of a new biochemistry laboratory course                 which will emphasize training in state-of-the-art instrumentation               and techniques involved in biochemistry and molecular biology.                  This award will provide instrumentation necessary for the                       implementation of this course.  Among the instruments to be                     purchased are a refrigerated centrifuge with rotors, computer                   controlled diode array spectrophotometer, a high performance                    liquid chromatography system with columns, and a variety of                     electrophoresis equipment for characterization of proteins and                  nucleic acids.  Several smaller items needed to initiate the                    laboratory course are also requested.  The intention of this                    course is to train students in the theoretical and practical use                of biochemical techniques which they might be expected to                       encounter in future professional training and/or employment.  In                addition to those majoring in biochemistry, the course will also                provide training to students from various areas of biology and                  agriculture.  The grantee institution is matching this NSF award                with funds from non-Federal sources.",
