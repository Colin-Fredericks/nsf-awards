 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate problems of signal processing from radar          receivers in a nonstationary noise environment.  It will investigate            adaptive techniques which aim at achieving a constant false alarm rate          (CFAR).  In particular, it will focus on robust CFAR detectors,                 utilizing distributed structures within one radar and concept                   described in \"Decentralized CFAR detection,\" by Barkat and Varshney,            forthcoming in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.           The goal is to achieve a detection performance which is insensitive to          correlation among the received pulses.  Receiver performance will be            made even more robust by extending the space diversity scheme to                monitor the same volume in space; i.e., the receiver above will be              extended to the case of multiple sensors.",
