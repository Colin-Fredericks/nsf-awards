 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research on the heat shock response in cultured avian cells                will determine how heat shock proteins enable cells to survive                  stress damage.  Antibodies raised against purified preparations                 of three chicken heat shock proteins have helped to identify                    several properties of closely-related, \"cognate\" proteins which                 are normally found in cells.  From a cDNA library selected for                  heat shock mRNA expression, ubiquitin was identified as a heat                  shock protein and one of the chicken ubiquitin genes was                        sequenced.  More recently, changes in ubiquitin metabolism during               heat shock and chemical stress were described and studies on the                biosynthesis of ubiquitin will be continued as part of the                      research program.                                                                                                                                               Cells in virtually all organisms are protected from damage and                  death arising from environmental stresses such as heat shock,                   strong oxidants and heavy metals by a small number of very highly               conserved proteins.  Genes encoding these proteins are                          selectively activated immediately upon exposure to stress by                    regulatory elements which appear to be similar in widely                        divergent organisms--from yeast to human.  This research focuses                on the heat shock protein ubiquitin.  This research will provide                a better understanding of how this heat shock protein protects                  cells from damage and helps restore them to their normal                        physiological state after the stress.",
