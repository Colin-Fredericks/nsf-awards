It will                           involve a retrospective assessment of the degree to which                       research on dual water systems that was conducted with                          support from the National Science Foundation under Grant                        No. 76-18499 (Multiple Water Supply for Urban Water                             Management) and 80-15075 (Alternative Technologies for                          Small Water System Management) has been influential in                          guiding adoption and engineering design of water                                distribution systems.  The research is being conducted by                       three undergraduate students under the Interdisciplinary                        Studies Division of Worcester Polytechnic Institute.                                                                                                            Results of this project are expected to be applied toward                       determining any further research needs associated with the                      process by which engineers select concepts for and design                       of water delivery systems.  The project is also expected to                     provide knowledge regarding improvement in the process by                       which results of research are made available to practicing                      environmental engineers.",
