The data are significant                  for the number of contrasts they provide to data on the                         acquisition of English and other languages.  The primary data set               provides a nine-month longitudinal sample of the language                       development of three K'iche' children between 2 and 4 years of                  age, which has been entered onto a computer to aid in analysis.                 During the period of the present grant, the investigator will                   return to Guatemala to collect additional pertinent data, and on                return will proceed with the analysis of the data and the                       preparation of a monograph summarizing the acquisition of                       phonology, morphology, and syntax in K'iche' and discussing some                of the learnability problems children face in acquiring this                    language.  The monograph will provide other researchers with a                  readily accessible summary of findings on the acquisition of a                  typologically interesting language.                                             %%%                                                                                  The study of the acquisition of language by children has now               reached the stage where it is crucial to obtain data from other                 languages which are structurally very different from English and                the other languages which have been most commonly studied.                      Complex theoretical models have been developed which make                       specific empirical claims which must be tested against a broad                  range of data, and modified where necessary, in order to bring us               closer to a true understanding of the language acquisition                      process.  The present project is a significant contribution to                  this need, focusing on the acquisition of a language, K'iche',                  which has fundamental structural differences from English which                 can be expected to challenge current theory in important                        respects.",
