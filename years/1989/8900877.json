 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this REU Site program, 12 undergraduate engineering students                 will participate in research projects in the laboratories of                    members of the Biomedical Engineering Department.  Opportunities                are available for research on biomedical instrumentation,                       sensors, prosthetics, biomaterials, neurophysiology, and neural                 modelling, cardiovalsular physiology and modelling, mathematical                modelling, and membrane and cellular physiology.  Students will                 be selected for the program on the basis of their experience, the               benefit to be derived from                                                      participation and a brief proposal.  Participants will work under               the day-to-day supervision of faculty members on research                       projects which the students have developed under the guidance of                a faculty mentor.  Students will discuss their research projects                in a weekly seminar series which will give students experience in               presenting research plans and results and in discussing their                   work with their peers.  A limited number of students will be able               to present results of their projects at national meetings.                      Examples of research and laboratory experiences that will involve               the student in the following projects: (1) basic and applied                    research on the processing of speech by ear, eyes, and haptic                   (cutaneous and positional) senses, (2) polymer-based, ion-                      selective electrode technology for biological sensors, (3)                      representation of the acoustic environment and the information                  processing of the auditory nervous system, and (4) the                          investigation of the cellular basis for the electrical and                      mechanical properties of the heart.",
