 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, supported by a ROW Career Advancement Award, has                 the goal of understanding Ca2+-regulated events at the molecular                level.  Structure-function relationships and mechanisms of                      regulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-activated enzymes, such as the type               II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase II) are                      studied.  CaM kinase II is found most prominently in the brain,                 where it is thought to be involved in regulating synaptic                       activity.  Biochemical treatment of CaM kinase II produces a                    catalytic fragment that can serve as a simplified kinase model                  for active site-directed structure-function studies.  To prepare                this monomeric kinase domain in amounts sufficient for                          biochemical and biophysical analyses, and to add new research                   capabilities to studies of this enzyme, this research will use                  recombinant DNA technology.  It is the aim of this particular                   project to subclone a cDNA corresponding to the first 280 amino                 acids of CaM kinase II into secretion-expression vectors for                    overexpression in Escherichia coli.  The recombinant kinase will                be purified and characterized.  This work will enhance the                      possibility of critical structural analysis of an important                     enzyme.",
