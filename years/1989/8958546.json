 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with three areas of database research;                geometric data, text and multimedia filing sytems and multiple                  disk file allocations.  In search of the best method to manage                  geometric data, several promising methods will be analyzed and                  implemented for comparison.  Emphasis will be given to space                    filling curves and fractals, such as the Peano curve, the Hilbert               curve, curves based on Gray codes, because they lead to good                    distance preserving mappings.  The second project involves the                  development of a multimedia document filing system.  The novel                  characteristics of the system is that it will use signature files               for text retrieval, it will use optical disks for storage and it                will allow static and animated images in the documents.                         Declustering techniques that store a file on multiple disks to                  maximize the parallellism will be studied.  This goal is the                    inverse of the first project.  The problem is to group unsimilar                records on the same disk.  A heuristic that uses information                    theory and error correcting codes, because the codewords of such                codes are deliberately unsimilar has been developed.  Preliminary               experiments show that this heuristic consistently outperforms                   older ad hoc heuristics.",
