 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory has isolated four putative MAPs from cultured                cells of Zea mays (corn) by copolymerization with purified maize                microtubules.  These proteins will be characterized at several                  different levels.  Antibodies will be raised against each of the                proteins, and will be used in immunofluorescence studies to                     determine the tissue and subcellular localization of each.  They                will be characterized biochemically and in in vitro functional                  assays, to determine their effects on microtubule polymerization,               stability, and morphology, and their possible enzymatic or                      mechanochemical activities.  The molecular interactions of the                  MAPs with microtubules will be investigated in a series of                      experiments designed to determine microtubule binding sites on                  the MAPs and MAP binding sites on the microtubules.  Finally,                   cDNA clones will be isolated and characterized for use in                       experiments that will test MAP function in vivo.                                                                                                                Microtubules are one of the major kinds of cytoskeletal elements                in all eukaryotic cells.  They represent the structural basis for               a wide variety of crucial motility functions in cells, including                the physical separation of chromosomes during mitosis or meiosis,               ciliary and flagellar movements, muscle contraction,                            intracellular transport of subcellular particles, etc.  The                     activities of microtubules are presumed to be mediated by                       microtubule-associated proteins, or MAPs.  However, in plants, no               such proteins have yet been demonstrated.  Plant microtubules                   have proven far more difficult to work with than animal                         microtubules, and techniques and procedures that work readily                   with animal-derived material do not work at all for plants.  This               laboratory has recently developed procedures for isolating pure                 microtubules, which was a necessary first step toward approaching               the problem of microtubule organization and function in plants at               the molecular level.  The proposed work has the potential to turn               into a major breakthrough in the understanding of plant                         cytoskeleton at the molecular level.",
