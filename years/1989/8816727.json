 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are a widely distributed group                 of bacteria which carry out oxygen-evolving photosynthesis                      similar to that characteristic of higher plants.  The studies                   to be performed are directed at achieving a detailed                            understanding at the molecular level of the structure and                       biosynthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus in these                           organisms.  The specific areas to be studies are (a) the                        unusual light-harvesting proteins (biliproteins) of marine                      unicellular cyanobacteria, a recently discovered group of                       important contributors to primary productivity in the sea; (b)                  exploitation of these proteins for the determination of energy                  transfer pathways within biliproteins; (c) continued                            development of biliprotein-based reagents for multiparameter                    studies of cells and molecules; (d) elucidation of the pathways                 of synthesis and attachment of the bilin (tetrapyrrole)                         prosthetic groups that endow biliproteins with the ability to                   absorb visible light; (d) the structural and functio use light-                 energy transduction in practical ways.  Specifically he                         proposes to study subunit and bilines of phycoerythrins from                    marine cyanobacteria, to reconstruct biliproteins from bilin                    and apobiliproteins, and to examine the role of N-mentyl                        asparagine on phycobilisome function.  One criticsm of the                      proposal is that there is no discussion of how the results will                 add to our knowledge of biliprotein function.                                   Another is that often the experimental approach lacks detail                    and can not be fully evaluated.  Finally there is considerable                  concern from the reviewers that the proposed methylation study                  that will consime a lot of research time, may not lead to                       anything.  In light of the excellent background, past                           accomplishments and the need to keep this study going, the                      panel recommends funding.",
