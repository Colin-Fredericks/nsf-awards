 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigations will continue investigation of the                      interactions between:  1) glacial response, 2) sea-level                        variations, and 3) climate, around the margin of the Laurentide                 Ice Sheet (LIS) in the vicinity of Hudson Strait and Frobisher                  Bay, Eastern Canadian Arctic.  The time-scale for the                           investigation includes two major moraine forming intervals, the                 Hall and Frobisher Bay moraines, that are C-14 dated at >=10.3                  and ca. 8.4 ka respectively.  The former may be coeval with the                 Younger Dryas stadial of NW Europe; the latter is a major event                 (Cockburn Substage) around the residual Laurentide Ice Sheet.                        In the first year, 1987, we cored three lakes a few                        kilometers form the Terra Nivea Ice Cap, on the south side of                   Frobisher Bay, and distal to the Frobisher Bay moraines.  In 1988               three lakes were cored distal to the Hall moraines.  These lakes                were cored at or below the marine limit so that we could 1) date                the marine/freshwater  transition for sea-level studies; and 2)                 use the litho-stratigraphy and diatom assemblages to investigate                whether sea-level fell monotonically after deglaciation or if                   later transgressions occurred.  Early studies by INSTAAR had                    suggested sea level fell rapidly after 9 ka ago unlike the more                 gradual emergence history farther north on Baffin Island.                       Stratigraphic sections in raised marine deposits indicated a                    possible transgression ca 8 ka ago.  In cooperation with the AMS                C-14 facility, University of Arizona, we have dated two of the                  marine/freshwater transitions in the first area; both date ca.                  8.6 +/- ka despite a difference in elevation of 24 m.  The                      emphasis in this renewal is to continue our program of lake                     coring in the region that lies distal to the 10.3 ka Hall                       moraines, but proximal to deposits of the Loks Land aminozone                   that has an estimated age of 40-50 ka.  Numerous lakes exist in                 the area and are accessible for both winter and summer coring                   operations.",
