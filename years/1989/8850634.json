 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to combine a constructivist approach to        teaching with technological tools for learning in order to improve the          undergraduate mathematics and science teacher preparation programs at           North Carolina State University. Revised courses will provide                   alternative models to the traditional lecture and chalkboard/overhead           method of instruction for undergraduates who are preparing to become            secondary mathematics and science teachers.  Since teachers teach as            they have been taught, graduates of the revised program should be able          to use a constructivist approach to teaching in their own classrooms and        enhance that teaching with existing and emerging technologies.  To              support this change four mathematicians, three scientists, five                 mathematics educators, four science educators, twelve teachers, and             several business executives will work collaboratively on revisions to           ten separate courses.  These specialists will be organized into teams           responsible for incorporating the use of appropriate technologies and a         constructivist approach to teaching into three mathematics courses, two         introductory science courses, three mathematics education courses, and          two science education courses.                                                                                                                                  The cost sharing for the project will be 135% of the NSF support.",
