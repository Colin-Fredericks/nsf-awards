 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last decade has seen a dramatic explosion in the studies of                 thrombogenesis and fibrinolysis.  These processes involve                       cascades of enzymes acting on precursor zymogens, thus allowing                 for multi-level, post-translational regulation.  Regulation also                occurs at the transciptional and translational levels and in the                precise bonds which these proteolytic enzymes recognize and                     cleave.  Post-translational regulation also occurs by specific                  inhibitors, the serpins, with precise active sites, regulated by                hormones, modulators, and other molecules.  Cell surface                        receptors for thrombin and the plasminogen activators (PAs) have                been found, allowing for another dimension for regulation.                                                                                                      Roles for these molecules in cell migration and tissue                          remodelling are expanding.  In metastasis, inflammation and                     physiological processes such as ovulation, proteases and                        inhibitors are being actively studied.  Recent information                      suggests important roles in the nervous systems.  At this time,                 it is necessary to bring leaders in this emerging field together                to communicate the still nascent state of knowledge about such                  intriguing molecules in the development, maintenance, plasticity                and degeneration of the nervous system.  The key for this                       advanced research workshop is the term \"extravascular.\"  These                  molecules are gene products of neuron and glia cells.  The                      evidence on which this workshop is based is four-fold:  (1)                     presence and release of urokinase (uPA) and tissue PA (tPA) at                  tips of nerve growth cones, (2) identity of glia-derived nexin                  and protease nexin (PNI), (3) localization of PNI at                            neuromuscular synapses, (4) detection of serpin and Kunitz                      inhibitor sequences in B-amyloid cloned from neuritic plaques of                victims of Alzheimer's disease.",
