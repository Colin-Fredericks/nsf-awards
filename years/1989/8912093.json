 "awd_abstract_narration": "The issue of optimal damages for death and serious permanent                    injury is one of the most important questions facing society                    today.  Although it is generally agreed that current award levels               are not optimal, no consensus has been reached on what the awards               should be.  This lack of consensus has resulted in diametrically                opposed trends.  At the same time that legislatures are trying                  to reduce damage awards for death and permanent injury by using                 caps, courts are increasing allowable recovery for death and                    serious permanent injury.  Despite the ofttimes fervor of the                   debate, little rigorous scholarship has been done on what                       constitutes optimal damage rules and damage awards.                                                                                                             Professor Arlen seeks to address this issue through her research.               Her project focuses on efficient damages from serious permanent                 physical injuries resulting from single activity accidents, in                  particular automobile accidents.  The work aims to determine what               damage awards induce efficient risk-taking and risk-spreading                   behavior under two conditions:  where all injured individuals                   suffer identical losses or where parties do not necessarily                     suffer the same losses.  The case of the automobile accident is                 both practically and theoretically important.  Automobile                       accidents are a primary cause of accidental serious permanent                   injury in contemporary life.  Further, such a single accident                   activity allows determining utility maximizing damage rules in                  situations (1) where individuals run risks of both injuring and                 being injured and (2) face the possibility of both paying and                   receiving damage awards.",
