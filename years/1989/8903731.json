 "awd_abstract_narration": "Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of                             eukaryotic chromosomes essential for the stable maintenance                     and complete replication of chromosome ends.  Broken                            chromosomes lacking telomeres are quite unstable, and a                         broken chromatid end may fuse after replication to its                          sister chromatid broken end.  However, under some conditions,                   broken chromosomes can be \"healed\" and recover as terminal                      deficiencies.  We now have the opportunity to study the                         dynamic behavior of terminal chromosome deficiencies and the                    mechanisms of healing events at the molecular level in                          Droposhila, because terminal chromosome deficiencies at the                     X-chromosome have been recovered at high frequency in females                   carrying a homozygous mutation of the mu-2 locus.  We have                      observed that these terminal deficiencies recede by losing                      DNA sequences at an apparently constant rate of 75 bp per fly                   generation, but that some terminal deficiencies acquire new                     DNA sequences at their distal ends.  This novel DNA addition                    apparently results in a phenotypic \"stabilization\" because                      the stock no longer changes phenotype over time from y2  to                     the more extreme y1 due to loss of sequences from the first                     exon of the yellow gene.  We have cloned and analyzed twelve                    different terminal fragments from one of the deficiencies                       (RT94).  None of the DNA fragments contains only typical                        telomeric sequences.  Three of the clones contain newly added                   DNA sequences at their distal end that are not present at the                   original break, while the other nine do not.  We propose to                     further investigate the properties of terminal deficiencies                     at the molecular level.  We will study the extent of                            heterogeneity of terminal DNA fragment lengths, and determine                   the origin, genomic distribution, and sequence of DNA                           fragments that occasionally become attached to the broken                       chromosome ends.  Moreover, we will investigate why and when                    during development DNA sequences are lost from the terminal                     deficiencies which have apparently not been \"capped\" by a                       natural telomere.  Since these terminal deficiencies do not                     behave like broken chromosome ends, yet apparently do not                       contain DNA sequences that are normally present in natural                      telomeres, they must be protected by some other components,                     possibly by proteins.  We will therefore search for such                        proteins that might be associated with the chromosome ends of                   terminal deficiencies.                                                                                                                                          These studies will provide insights into the molecular                          mechanisms that are responsible for the behavior of such                        broken chromosome ends.  They will also identify reactions                      that might occur at natural telomeres and that are causing                      the well known dynamic behavior of telomeres in many                            eukaryotes.",
