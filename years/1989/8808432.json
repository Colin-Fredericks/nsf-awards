 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Science and Technology of Advanced Cement-Based                Materials at Northwestern University is a collaborative                         interdisciplinary effort involving research groups from                         Northwestern University, the University of Illinois at Champaign-               Urbana, Purdue University, the University of Michigan, and the                  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST--formerly                  NBS).  The director of the Center will be Professor Surendra P.                 Shah of Northwestern University.                                                  There are two basic complementary objectives to the research                  plan of the Center.  The first is to provide a more complete                    understanding of the cementitious materials that are currently                  available, thus fostering more effective and efficient use.  The                second is to provide a comprehensive basis for the design of new                materials with greatly improved properties.                                       The plan of research includes: 1) the chemistry and physics of                cementitious materials (rheology and setting processes, chemistry               of silicate and aluminate cements, solid-solution interface                     chemistry, new cement chemistries, and polymer-cement                           composites); 2) processing science (prehardening processing,                    rheological processes, influence of temperature and pressure,                   influence of microstructure and reinforcement geometries, and                   novel processing techniques); 3) microstructural analysis                       (properties of reaction products, pore structure, solid-solid                   interfaces, and component distributions); 4) material properties                (fracture processes and mechanisms, diffusion and transport                     phenomena, long-term deformation, environmental and thermal                     stability); and 5) fiber reinforcement (fiber geometry and                      distribution, fiber-matrix interactions, and micromechanics).                   These areas are interdependent and each will be augmented by                    mathematical modelling of reactions, processes and properties.                  The models generated will be used for predictive performance                    analyses and as a tool to develop new materials, processes, and                 systems.  They will serve as a basis for introducing changes in                 the way cement-based materials are designed, fabricated and used.                 Outreach activities planned by the Center include publications                and presentations, conferences, an industrial affiliates program,               university-industry research projects and short courses.",
