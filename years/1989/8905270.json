 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general aim of this research is the isolation and                      characterization of components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that           are involved in the processing and modification of newly synthesized            proteins.  This proposal focuses specifically on the components of the          ER that may mediate the formation of the correct disulfide bonds during         the early stages of protein folding and assembly.  The luminal                  microsomal enzyme protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) has long been the           best candidate to carry out this function.  Recently, however, a newly          described luminal microsomal protein, ERp72, has been cloned in our             laboratory.  ERp72 has the striking property of possessing three repeats        of the amino acid sequences that are thought to be the active site              sequences of PDI. Accordingly, the research described in this proposal          is designed to provide new insights into the possible functional                relationship between ERp72 and PDI.  The first specific aim of this             proposal is to determine directly whether ERp72 can act as a protein            disulfide isomerase.  Full- length expressible cDNA clones encoding             ERp72 and PDI will be expressed in eukaryotic and bacterial cells and           the expressed protein will be assayed for PDI activity directly.  The           second specific aim of this proposal is to obtain insights into the             functional relationship between ERp72 and PDI by investigating and              comparing important biological parameters of the two proteins.  The             relative expression of the two proteins in various tissues will be              determined.  In addition, the mechanism of ER localization of the two           proteins and their protein \"neighborhoods\" in the ER will be elucidated.        The approaches described n this proposal should help us elucidate the           way in which the environment in the ER helps to mediate the processes of        protein folding and disulfide bond formation.                                        The results of our studies may increase our ability to engineer            cells that would be extremely efficient in the synthesis, folding,              processing, and transport of cloned protein of potential commercial and         therapeutic value.",
