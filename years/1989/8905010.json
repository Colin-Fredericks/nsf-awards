 "awd_abstract_narration": "A primary intracellular target for calcium ions acting as second                messengers are  calcium binding proteins.  In plants, calmodulin                is the only recognized and biochemically characterized calcium                  binding protein.  Animals, on the other hand, contain a number of               additional calcium-binding proteins (calmodulin-like proteins),                 which mediate cell- or tissue- specific calcium-regulated                       processes.  The working hypothesis for this research, based on                  cDNA cloning and direct biochemical assays, is that plants also                 contain calmodulin-like proteins which may mediate calcium-                     regulated processes distinct from those mediated by calmodulin.                 To test and further extend this hypothesis the following specific               goals are proposed: (1) to complete the characterization of a                   cDNA clone, isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana, which encodes a                 polypeptide that shares approximately 60% amino acid sequence                   identity with other higher plant calmodulins, by comparing the                  biochemical properties of the protein encoed by this clone with                 authentic calmodulin purified from Arabidopsis seedlings; (2) to                develop an antobody6 probe for the protein encoded by the                       Arabidopsis cDNA, and to use this probe to ascertain the tissue-                specificity of expression of the calmodulin-like polypeptide                    during Arabidopsis development, and to examine the subcellular                  distribution of target proteins that potentially interact with                  the calmodulin-like polypeptide; and (3) to examine the                         functional relationship between calmodulin and the Arabidopsis                  calmodulin-like protein using NAD kinase activation as a model                  target enzyme system.                                                                                                                                           The long range goals of this research are to identify in plants                 the members of the family of calcium binding proteins, and to                   determine what physiological roles these proteins play in plant                 growth and development.  Since similar proteins are known to be                 important in the regulation of many intracellular functions in                  animals, the characterization of these putative regulatory                      molecules in plants should greatly enhance our understanding of                 the regulation of plant cell function by calcium.",
