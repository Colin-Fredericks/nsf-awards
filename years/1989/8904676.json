 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of a previous collaborative grant with Scripps                       Institution was to determine the production rates of 10Be and                   26Al made by cosmic-ray interactions with quartz.  We now plan to               make use of this in situ production of cosmogenic radionuclides                 to study rates of erosion, extents of glaciation, rates of                      uplift, and in general, to determine histories of surface                       morphology.  In addition to continuing measurements of 10Be and                 26Al produced in quartz, we plan to study the 14C produced in the               same samples-thus providing better control over the most recent                 exposure history (last -20 ka).  We also plan to test the                       feasibility of measuring 41Ca in feldspars and soil samples.                    41Ca's lifetime of -100 ka makes it appear ideal for studying                   surface development subsequent to the most recent period of                     glaciation, but complications arising from the fact that it is                  made from neutron capture, may make it too sensitive to water                   content and matrix effects to be useful as a chronometer.                       Finally, we would like to further improve our measurements                      capabilities for 26Al and 10Be, specifically by improving                       precision and by introducing automation into our measurement                    procedures.",
