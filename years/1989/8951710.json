 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to offer students experience with modern            instrumentation and computing equipment for nuclear physics.  The               equipment centers on high resolution gamma ray dector and IBM computer          with a math co-processor.  Supporting equipment includes a plotter to           produce hard copy output from the computer, as well as electronic               modules to shape, amplify, and analyze the signals from the detector.           Other supporting equipment includes radioactive sources which will be           studied with the equipment requested.                                                                                                                           The equipment will be used to instruct students bound for employment as         teachers or engineers or bound for further education in physics,                chemistry, geology or engineering.  Specifically this equipment will be         used to improve teaching of the instrumentation and methods of nuclear          physics.                                                                                                                                                        The University will match the award with an equal amount of funds.",
