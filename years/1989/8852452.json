 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is called RULE:  Revitalized Undergraduate Laboratory              Environment.  It is the first phase of the development of resources             envisioned to eventually embrace the whole curriculum with an                   integrated environment that brings all computing resources to                   undergraduate students through the same man-machine interface.  This            interface will evolve in an upwardly compatible way from the one                developed by Xerox PARC and popularized by Apple Macintosh.  They will          begin the first phase by building a networked Macintosh SE laboratory           to support programming I and II, files processing, data structures and          algorithm analysis and the computer organization and computer networks          courses.  The project will be an innovative one coupling Karel the              Robot programming teaching environment with Modula-2 as the programming         language in programming I.  These courses will be joined by the                 remainder of the core courses and many electives in the second phase of         development.  That phase will include IBM 370 assembler programming on          the Macintosh once they complete the cross-assembler, and the                   University reaches their building with the evolving campus computing            network.  This second phase will support most of the upper-division             courses on more powerful, workstation class Mac II machines.  Although          they have a different architecture, the human interface is the same.            That is why the Macintosh SE was chosen for the first phase that                comprises this project; it is part of an evolving, comprehensive                environment for computing.",
