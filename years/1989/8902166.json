Such flows                    have many applications in industry, such as the formation of                    bicomponent fibers, the transport of oil in pipelines, ink-jet                  printing and lubrication.  It is well known that such flows can                 also exhibit phenomena which are totally unexpected based on                    our knowledge of one-fluid flows.  Theoretically, many                          possibilities exist for the shape of the boundary separating                    the two fluids.  Yet experiments show that some shapes are                      preferred over others, although the underlying selection                        mechanisms are not well understood.  A chief objective of this                  proposal is to study, analytically and computationally, the                     stability of the various steady arrangements of two-layer                       flows, and the evolution of new arrangements from unstable ones.",
