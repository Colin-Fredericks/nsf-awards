This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support several research                    projects in the Department of Mathematics at the University of                  California, Los Angeles: Calculations in the Jacobians of                       Hyperelliptic Curves, Distribution of Algebraic Numbers,                        Arithmetic over Finite Fields, and Linear Recurrent Sequences,                  directed by David Cantor; Determination of Cohomology Groups                    Arising from Conic Curves and Determination of Witt Rings of                    Elliptic Curves over Finite Fields, directed by Richard Elman;                  Isospectral Deformations of Partial Difference Operators,                       directed by David Gieseker; Minimal Free Resolutions of Finitely                Generated Modules over the Symmetric Algebra of a Vector Space,                 directed by Mark Green; and Galois Groups over Algebraic Number                 Fields, directed by Murray Schacher.",
