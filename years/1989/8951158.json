 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade, there have been significant                        technological advances in analytical instumentation.  Cal State                 L.A.'s special concern at this time is the strong need to improve               science education and hands-on, instrumentation-based laboratory                instruction for undergraduates who are not necessarily chemistry                majors but need certain chemistry skills for advancement in their               own fields.  In our experience, non-chemistry majors, like their                counterparts in chemistry, gain a far better understanding of                   chemistry concepts and the potentials of modern science when they               use up-to-date instrumentation for hands-on laboratory                          experiments.  This project utilizes a computerized fluorescence                 spectrometer to be used mainly by students per year.  The                       relative ease in the operation of the spectrometer at this level                in the chemistry curriculum catalyzes a group of non-chemistry                  majors to grasp the excitement of science and increases the                     students' confidence in their ability to preform experiments and                improve their attitudes toward studying science for the                         accomplishment of their professional goals.  The institution is                 matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
