 "awd_abstract_narration": "Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin will            establish an Engineering Research Center for Offshore Technology, whose         goals are:                                                                      (1)  To identify current and future technology needs of the off-shore           industry for producing from deep water installations; and                       (2)  Conduct cross-disciplinary research to fulfill these needs with            the active participation of the off-shore industry;                                  Exploiting deep ocean resources will require new structures and            equipment to support engineering operations on and beneath the ocean            surface.  Early ocean petroleum exploration and production was                  concentrated in shallow water, using structures and facilities designed         through engineering techniques developed for operations on land.  Such          approaches are not feasible in water deeper than 1000 feet.  The                purpose of the Center is to build the basic engineering capability for          technologies to exploit resource recovery in the difficult and harsh            environments of the deep ocean.                                                      New ideas for deep-water production envision floating                      production/system with three components, a subsea production unit on            the ocean floor, a floating processing platform on the ocean surface,           and flexible, vertical risers connecting the two.  Design will require          major advances in basic engineering knowledge.  To generate the                 requisite knowledge, research will be grouped into three areas:                      Hydrodynamic loadings in deep water,                                            Structural integrity of deep water systems,                                     Materials for ocean applications.                                               The education program will include both undergraduates and                 graduates, divided approximately equally.  Their education will involve         both research participation and hands-on design experience.  The design         will provide a basis for the education of students as working members           of a cross-disciplinary design teams.                                                Industry will look to the Center for basic engineering research            and design.  Full-scale evaluation, development and application will be         the specific effort of each company.  This will permit the companies to         compete on the development phase, which is the area of their expertise.         While with the universities, they can cooperate on the basic                    engineering research phase, which is the proper domain of university            expertise.",
