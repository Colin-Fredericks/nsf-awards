 "awd_abstract_narration": "Life-Cycle Engineering is the simultaneous consideration                   during the product design stage of product function, design,                    materials, manufacturing processes and cost, testability,                       serviceability, quality, and reliability.  Since most life-cycle                costs are dictated in the design phase, it is important that                    life-cycle information be accessible to the designer so that it                 can influence product design.                                                        This project investigates a new way to support Life-Cycle                  Engineering, one that involves using constraint network                         technology to provide the designer with life-cycle information.                 The constraint network represents the constraining influences                   from various aspects of a product's life-cycle that exert                       themselves on the product and must be satisfied by the parameters               of the overall system.  With such a constraint network, the                     designer has a means by which he can access and take into account               information from all phases of the product life cycle, e.g.,                    standards and regulations, company policy, manufacturing                        capability, requirements for testability, reliability, and                      serviceability, and cost and delivery deadline considerations.                  The project is a cross-disciplinary endeavor of scientists and                  engineers from industry and the university, with technical                      support and input coming from major national laboratories and                   programs.",
