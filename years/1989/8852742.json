 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a new venture in computer-                        controlled experimental laboratory courses which completes a                    biological psychology track consisting of physiological                         psychology, behavioral neurochemistry, neuropsychology, and                     psychophysiology.  Students will design, run, analyze and write                 up neuropsychological experiments on a Macintosh II computer.                   Experiments with the major perceptual functions of the cortex,                  attention and memory as well as higher reasoning functions will                 complement the focus on motivation and habitat and autonomic                    learning systems in the other biological psychology courses.  A                 broad exposure to the instrumentation of experimental                           neuropsychology is aimed for, with experiments involving dichotic               listening techniques, tachistoscope methods, computer-controlled                assessment of attention and memory, as well as traditional paper                and pencil methods of neuropsychology.  The project focusses on                 teaching experimental methods and proposes that new assessments                 of the spatial distribution of attention will be created on the                 Macintosh II computer.  The Macintosh software Hypercard will be                used to create a laboratory manual and an environment where the                 student can interact with the computer without special knowledge                of computers.  Cumulative data collection and storage procedures                as well as course mechanics such as exams and grading, study                    guides, class notes, and course evaluation will be included in                  the manual.  The grantee institution is matching this NSF award                 with funds from non-Federal sources.",
