Coordinated mathematical modeling and experimental                              approaches will be used to address two general types of                         problems in the category of receptor-mediated cell                              phenomena.  First, a quantitative understanding of the                          mechanisms and kinetics of the processing                                       (transport/reaction/separation) of receptors and their                          ligands will be developed.  Efforts in this area will focus                                                                                                     on the intracellular processing of these molecules in                           endocytosis and the trafficking of these molecules during                       antigen presentation.  Second, the mechanisms and kinetics                                                                                                      of biological signal transduction, particularly the                             involvement of receptors in the inositol                                        trisphosphate/calcium ion signal transduction pathway, will                                                                                                     be investigated.                                                                                                                                                An important aspect of cell function is the ability of                          cells to sense and respond to their environment.  This                          communication between cells and their surroundings is                           critical to normal cell functioning, to the immune                              response, and to the action of pharmacologic agents, and is                                                                                                     impaired in many disease states.  An ability to                                 quantitatively understand and manipulate these                                  communication mechanisms is thus crucial to many areas of                       modern biotechnology and has application to the maintenance                                                                                                     of cell cultures, the development of new pharmaceuticals,                       and the treatment of disease.  In this research,                                engineering principles will be applied to these fundamental                                                                                                     problems in cell biology, with the goal of discovering the                                                                                                      relevant mechanisms and kinetics involved in these                              communication processes.",
