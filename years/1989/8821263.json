 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been debated whether populations of phytophagous                    insects are regulated by density-dependent processes acting to                  return their densities to equilibrium levels, or whether they                   are characterized instead by non-equilibrium processes such as                  local extinction and recolonization.  This question will be                     addressed by performing density-perturbation experiments on                     Microrhopala vittata, a leaf-mining beetle that feeds on                        goldenrod (Solidago spp.).  Work will commence with assessments                 of density, mortality and fecundity of this beetle in several                   small (<1000 stems) stands of goldenrod.  Populations will then                 have their density experimentally supplemented (to levels 10-20%                below the minimum observed), and the effect of these                            manipulations on predation, parasitism, fecundity and dispersal                 will be quantified.  All samples for mortality and fecundity will               be done non-destructively (no Microrhopala or enemies will be                   killed) so that quantification of these processes will not affect               population density.  A return of Microrhopala density to more                   moderate levels following perturbations will support the                        equilibrium viewpoint.  Alternatively, supplemented populations                 may irrupt and reduced populations may become locally extinct;                  this would constitute evidence for the non-equilibrium viewpoint.                                                                                               Funding is being awarded for two years of postdoctoral fellowship               research at The University of Quebec in Montreal, Canada.",
