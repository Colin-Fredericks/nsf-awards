 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project would connect the eight campuses in the                  University of Maine System to the NSFNET.  The System's Computing               and Data Processing Services has in place the initial nodes of a                TCP/IP based network currently connecting the three largest                     campuses.  Additionally, several private colleges in Maine will                 be offered connectivity to the University's System.                                                                                                               A high speed link is proposed (1.5 million bits per second),                  which would connect the Portland Campus with a major NSFNET node                in the Boston area.  The Portland Campus, in turn is connected to               the other System's major campuses via high speed links provided                 by the University.                                                                                                                                                Once the connection is established, researchers using computers               can exchange data with any other NSFNET site with great ease.  It               also significantly facilitates data transfer between the                        mainframes at the University of Maine campuses with other                       advanced facilities on the NSFNET and provides remote log-in                    capabilities from the System's campuses to supercomputer centers                and allows for quick transfer of results to local computers for                 analysis.***",
