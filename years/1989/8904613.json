 "awd_abstract_narration": "PIs will study the paleotopographic, subsidence and source                 area development history of the Upper Jurassic to Lower                         Cretaceous foreland stratigraphic sequence along the southern                   part of the Columbian orogenic belt in Canada and adjacent parts                of Montana.  The Columbian/Sevier belt, which marks the                         culmination of Late Mesozoic orogency in the Norther American                   Cordillera, is generally continuous along its length and overall                is similar in structural style, timing and stratigraphic                        development of the adjacent foreland basin.  Both regions contain               Upper Jurassic, mud-dominated fluvial deposits with easterly                    paleoflow; comparatively widespread Lower Cretaceous chert-pebble               grave; and a regional sub-Cretaceous unconformity separating the                two units.  The two regions differ, however, in the details of                  distribution and paleoflow directions within these units.  In                   addition, the interpretation of tectonic driving forces differ                  between the two belts with collisions primarily responsible for                 the Columbian belt and magmatic activity apparently generating                  the Sevier belt.                                                                     By quantitatively analyzing the southern Columbian foreland                sequence and comparing these data to our previous study of the                  Sevier foreland sequence we will determine if the sequences                     record a similar evolutionary history.  If so, then can two                     different mechanisms active in the Columbian and Sevier belts                   produce the same stratigraphic record?  If not, then how do two                 very different thrust belt driving mechanisms produce such                      grossly similar stratigraphic packages and where does the                       transition lie between the two orogenic belts?",
