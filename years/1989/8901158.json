The goal of this project if to expand the base of support                       available to undergraduate students working in Psychobiology.                   This award will provide summer stipends and supply budgets for 9                Summer Research Fellows.  Five undergraduates will be selected                  from the University of Virginia and neighboring colleges and                    universities and 4 undergraduates will be selected specifically                 from predominantly black colleges and universities in the                       immediate region (i.e. Howard University, Norfolk State                         University, Virginia Union University, etc).  Each student will                 be assigned to a faculty preceptor who will direct his/her daily                laboratory activities.  In addition, each student will meet each                week in a formal seminar directed by a faculty member.  Each                    student will present a research seminar at the end of the summer                which summarizes his/her research effort.  With this program, we                hope to proved encouragement to promising undergraduates to                     consider careers in academic research and teaching in                           psychobiology.",
