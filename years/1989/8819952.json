 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the use of weak column-strong beam                    (WCSB) moment frames for seismic resistant design.  A recent                    analytical study of such a steel frame indicates that WCSB                      frames may have greatly increased ductility demand and reduced                  available ductility over that obtained in comparable strong                     column-weak beam (SCWB) structures.  This raises a question                     as to whether these recent changes are conservative.                                                                                                            In this study rational guidelines for the design of frames with                 the WCSB configuration will be developed.  The inelastic                        seismic behavior of steel building frames of different heights                  and geometry subjected to different seismic design criteria and                 acceleration records will be analyzed.  The analyses will                       consider and compare the response for WCSB frames,                              comparable SCWB frames, and frames with weak columns at                         isolated stories or single column lines.  The ductility demand                  will be computed and compared for the various conditions, and                   the comparison will isolate a few conditions for further                        experimental evaluation.  The results will provide a better                     understanding of the behavior of weak column frames and form                    a basis for improved design procedures.                                                                                                                         This research proposal has received the support of the                          Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC)                          Seismology Committee in a resolution passed June 18, 1988, and                  formal approval of this support by the SEAOC State Board of                     Directors is pending.  It is also supported by the American Iron                and Steel Institute (AISI) Seismic Building Codes Committee,                    and this committee will establish an Advisory Panel for the                     conduct of the research.                                                                                                                                        Several professional engineering associations and code                          committees including the Structural Engineers Association of                    California (SEAOC) endorsed this study due to the practical                     significance of the subject.",
