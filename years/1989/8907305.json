 "awd_abstract_narration": "The damage or survival of structures after                                      major earthquakes provide information that                                      can alter subsequent design, construction and                                   usage.  Presently, investigations of the same                                   data often produce conflicting reasons for                                      the existence of the final state.  The                                          project is to develop a methodology to assess                                   various explanatory scenarios that are                                          constructed after an earthquake.  This                                          investigation will deal with such subjective                                    information as the quality of the design                                        form, the labor and financial climate and the                                   effect of these features on the likelihood of                                   the existence of errors and subsequent                                          malfunctioning of a structure.  Also                                            measurable information will be merged with                                      the subjective evaluation to provide a basis                                    for assessing the relative merits of the                                        scenarios.                                                                                                                                                      The research will enhance the fundamental                                       understanding of the state of the structure                                     before the earthquake and the modeling of the                                   structure which exhibits the final response.",
