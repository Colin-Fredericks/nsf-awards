 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study will provide the first comprehensive                    analysis of evolutionary relationships in the genus Ambystoma,                  the mole salamanders.  Relationships will be determined by                      measuring genetic differences in mitochondrial DNA.  With a well                supported phylogenetic tree, one can study the biogeographical                  factors involved in the adaptive radiation of the group.  This                  part of the study will also provide information on the mechanisms               of evolution of mitochondrial DNA in amphibians, a group for                    which to be used in this study may prove useful for determining                 genetic relationships in many other biological systems.                              A good phylogeny will provide the context for the second                   part of this study.  The mole salamander genus includes several                 distinctive clonally reproducing (unisexual) forms; these                       originated by hybridization between different species of                        Ambystoma.  In the second part of the proposed study,                           mitochondrial DNA will be used to analyze genetic variation in                  the clonal populations.  This will provide information on the                   maternal ancestors of clonal forms.  It will also show whether                  there were many or few such origins, recent or ancient.  One will               therefore be able to reconstruct a history of these lineages--                  where did they come from, how, when, and to what extent did they                spread.  Such an evolutionary history will provide the necessary                background for more detailed studies of the genetic mechanisms                  involved in producing clonal organisms.",
