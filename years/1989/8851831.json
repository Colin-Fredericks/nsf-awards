 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at establishing a permanent optoelectronics               laboratory which will 1) immensely improve the quality of the current           laboratory 2) provide facilities to establish a new                             lecture/laboratory class in fiber optics 3) provide a permanent                 setting for undergraduate research projects, and 4) motivate students           to consider careers and graduate education in optoelectronics.  The             equipment includes optical, electronic and computer equipment for               establishing a flexible laboratory.  Two stations will be computer-             interfaced, the others manual or partly computer-controlled.  The               laboratory will reinforce the lecture material and also allow                   students to duplicate current research work from the literature.  This          facility is the only optoelectronic teaching laboratory in Oregon               which is rapidly becoming a center for optoelectronic companies.                Adequate facilities are needed to meet the needs of students and to             provide retraining for industrial scientists and engineers.                     Stimulated students are also much more likely to pursue graduate                education.",
