 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a cooperative effort between researchers at             Tuskegee University and Purdue University.  Faculty and students in the         Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science at Tuskegee University,            and Computer Science at Purdue University have performed considerable           research in the proposed field over the past decade.  The faculty of            Tuskegee University will work together to establish the research and            M.S. degree programs at Tuskegee University as their primary goal, as           well as to further develop research at Purdue.                                                                                                                  The result of this project will be the establishment of a research              program in Computer Science at Tuskegee University that will attract            and train minority graduate students, thereby increasing the pool of            available minority students qualified for research positions in                 industry.  It is anticipated that some of the graduates of this program         will continue on to PhD degrees at Purdue and other universities,               increasing the number of minorities in high-level research positions            both in industry and academia.  However, these benefits                         notwithstanding, the anticipated results of the proposed research will          be valuable in the development of parallel algorithms in various fields         of science and engineering.",
