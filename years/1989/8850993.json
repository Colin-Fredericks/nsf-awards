 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project will provide teachers from three San Francisco          high schools with high minority enrollments with the tools with which to        rebuild their college-track mathematics classes.  With the assistance of        university mathematicians, a total of approximately 25 high school              mathematics teachers will examine exemplary curricular materials in             mathematics, incorporate them into their classes, and adapt to the early        high school setting a model of collaborative learning that has proven           successful with minority college freshmen.                                                                                                                      Each summer, 12 high school teachers and 3 junior high school teachers          will participate in a six-week workshop that includes deepening their           own understanding of mathematics, studying and adapting exemplary               materials, and testing those materials in a \"transition summer school.\"         During the academic year, each of the high school teachers will spend           one hour per day in curricular planning and the preparations of                 inservice workshops.  Project staff will meet weekly with participants          in their individual schools and monthly with the participants as a              group.                                                                          Dissemination of the project's impact beyond the three participating            schools will include a district-sponsored two-week summer institute, the        inclusion of project teachers in the district's mentor teacher program,         and the participation of                                                        project teachers on district and state curriculum committees.                                                                                                   The university and the school district are contributing as cost-                sharing an amount equal to 77% of the NSF award.",
