 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, students are introduced to modern                         separations by a series of experiments starting in general                      chemistry courses and continuing through all of the chemistry                   laboratory courses.  In addition, students are exposed to                       computer controlled instrumentation and data acquisition.  The                  equipment consists of an HPLC system, including a computer                      controlled diode array spectrometer as the detector, and two                    student gas chromatographs and recorder.  The experiments are                   designed to give the students repeated exposure to separation                   techniques at different degrees of complexity as they progress                  through the chemistry program.  In addition, experiments                        involving fast kinetics and simultaneous analysis of mixtures are               possible with the equipment.  Both types of experiments give the                students experience with computer controlled data acquisition and               processing.                                                                                                                                                     The institution is overmatching the NSF grant by 180%",
