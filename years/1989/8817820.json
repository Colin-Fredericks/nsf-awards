 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine how sunflecks in forest                         understories affect the growth, reproduction and ecological                     performance of plants.  The availability of light for                           photosynthesis limits plant growth in the understory and much of                the light that is received comes in the form of brief periods of                direct sunlight (sunflecks) that penetrate holes in the overstory               canopy.  Sunflecks and the larger sun \"patches\" created by tree                 or branch falls are ecologically important but little studied.                  These are highly variable both spatially and temporally because                 of differences in overstory canopy structure.  Research in this                 proposal will examine how light of different frequencies and                    durations. influences growth performance.  How plants acclimate                 to fluctuating light and the constraints to efficient utilization               of this light will also be investigated.  The research will be                  carried out primarily on a tropical forest understory herb,                     Alocasia macrorrhiza.  Understory herbs are an important but                    poorly understood component of tropical forests.                                     This work has several implications for forest management and               agriculture.  Regeneration of forests occurs through                            establishment of seedings in the understory or in gaps.  An                     understanding of the environmental and physiological controls on                the growth and ecology of these plants is therefore important for               understanding how to manage and maintain these forests.",
