 "awd_abstract_narration": "The core research focuses on the representation, management,                    and communication of data, design decisions, and knowledge                      throughout the life cycle of facility planning, design,                         construction, and management.  The integrated data systems                      accommodate spatial data (3D object models), graphical data                     (pictorial representations), nonspatial data (object attributes,                specification), temporal data (design versions and construction                 plans), and design-dependent knowledge (the rationale behind                    design decisions).  Previous work established a new model                       for integrating existing engineering databases and applications                 across networked computers through an intelligent, centralized                  network interface, including automatic translation of data                      queries and replies between widely varying views of data.  The                  model has been implemented in a prototype system called KADBASE                 (Knowledge-Aided Database Management).                                                                                                                          The KADBASE research will help architects, engineers,                           contractors, and facility managers cooperate and communicate                    using their current, familiar applications and their successors.                The organizational problems arising from industry fragmentation                 will be at least partially alleviated through the virtual                       integration of engineering computer systems using this approach. //",
