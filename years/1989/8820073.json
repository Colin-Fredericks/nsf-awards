 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant, funded by the Organic Dynamics Program in                           Chemistry,provides support for the research of Dr. Jerome                       Berson at Yale University. The objective of the research is the                 preparation, isolation and characterization of often unstable                   intermediates formed in chemical reactions. The chemical and                    physical behaviour of the reactive intermediates  will be                       correlated with theoretical calculations.                                                                                                                       The principal intermediates to be studied are biradicals, which                 Berson makes by innovative synthetic routes.  He will isolate                   them using techniques such as  low temperature matrix isolation                 and then measures their spectral properties.  On warming he can                 observe the regiospecific dimerization and cyclization                          behaviour of the biradicals and correlate the results with                      theory. These studies enhance our fundamental understanding of                  how chemical reactions occur and should be useful along a broad                 front of chemical syntheses.",
