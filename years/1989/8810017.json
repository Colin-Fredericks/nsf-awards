 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development of a general theory, based on           screw theory, for the simultaneous force and motion (hybrid) control of         robot manipulators.  Successful conclusion of this research will                enhance a manipulator's ability to perform compliant motion tasks               including industrial assembly, machining, contour tracking,                     coordination of multiple manipulators grasping the same workpiece,              control of robots with less than six degrees of freedom, and control of         robots near singular configurations.  The fundamental problem addressed         here is that given the requirement to control specific axes for force,          while simultaneously controlling the others for position, how must the          problem be formulated and error signals generated such that the error           correction signals sent to the actuators are consistent and provide a           stable response.  Current research on the problem has focused on                supplementing environmental constraints with a set of artificial                constraints.  Although promising, the approach when implemented has             demonstrated instabilities.  It is not clear if the instabilities are           kinematic in nature or a function of the implementation approach.  This         project assumes a kinematic difficulty and attempts to resolve the              kinematic issue through an appeal to screw theory.  The hybrid control          theory developed will be general in the sense that it must provide a            solution for simultaneous motion and force control of an end effector           performing any constrained tasks, and furthermore, will be invariant to         translation of origin, change of scale, and change of coordinate frame.         The theory will be evaluated by means of laboratory experiments.",
