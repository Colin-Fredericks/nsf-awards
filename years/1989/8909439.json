 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of \"homeostasis\" (the idea that the body tends to                   balance various factors to maintain a stable internal state) is a               key part of most current explanations of ingestive behavior, in                 particular water and salt intake.  However, a number of                         observations, including Dr. Rowland's own, suggest that this is                 too simple a view of the mechanism and organization of ingestive                behaviors.  This research project will critically examine the                   homeostatic model in several new ways, including the use of a                   sham-drinking rat preparation in which ingested fluids are lost                 through a tube from the stomach out of the animal.                                                                                                              Dr. Rowland and others have shown that water deprivation                        increases sham drinking more than normal drinking.  Surprisingly,               however, Dr. Rowland has been unable to produce this greater                    increase in sham drinking with the presumed elementary thirst                   stimuli, hypovolemia (low blood volume) and hyperosmolarity (high               concentration of chemicals dissolved in the blood).  The first                  experiment will use different routes of administration of salt at               different times of day in order to assess the generality of the                 surprising finding.  Dr. Rowland will also examine the                          microstructure (bursts and pauses) of drinking and attempt to                   assess the role of very-short-term feedback loops on oral satiety               that may override physiologic thirst signals (and thus be                       independent of the controls of fluid homeostasis).  While such                  oral satiety factors have been suspected for many years, they                   have never been analyzed convincingly.                                                                                                                          The second and third experiments will deal with oral versus                     systemic factors in the control of salt intake, again using sham                ingestion as an experimental tool to separate oral from systemic                (pre- and post-ingestional) factors.  At least two different                    strains of rats will be studied because of genetic differences in               salt preference.  Dr. Rowland hopes to be able to assess, from                  microstructural analysis of sham drinking, the mechanisms by                    which this genetic difference affects behavior.                                                                                                                 Dr. Rowland's studies place a new theoretical importance on oral                factors as primary mechanisms in maintaining fluid balance and                  have wider implications for the interplay between systemic states               and environmental stimuli in the control of behavior.",
