 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of how the marine nitrogen cycle and the organisms                mediating the transformations of nitrogen in the cycle have                     changed tremendously over the past five years.  Bacteria can                    compete with phytoplankton for inorganic nitrogen, and yet, may                 also serve as regenerators of nitrogen compounds depending upon                 their nutritional and physiological state. Changing concepts of                 how systems work frequently go hand in hand with advances in                    methodology.  This is true for marine nitrogen cycling, in                      particular, the role of organic nitrogen.  The use of 15N-                      labelled substrates have been the major tool with which inorganic               nitrogen uptake and NH4+ regeneration have been studied to date.                This research addresses the relationship and couplings between                  inorganic nitrogen, in the form of NH4+, and organic nitrogen in                the form of urea and amino acids, using a number of new                         techniques, including: 1) a dual labelling techniques for                       simultaneous measurements of uptake and release of urea: 2) a                   filtering technique for the bacterial fraction that is compatible               with mass spectrometry; 3) ion exchange column techniques for                   recovering 15N-labelled DON/amino acids from incubation                         experiments; and 4) measurement of low-level NH4+ concentrations                by solvent extraction.  The combination of laboratory and field                 experiments are aimed at establishing relationships between                     organism size and nutritional state, and microplankton NH4+ and                 urea regeneration.",
