During the twelve                  month period beginning 1 September 1989, Professor Stankovich will              undertake a program to develop expertise in genetic engineering                 such that she can produce metalloenzymes with well-defined                      molecular characteristics to serve as models with which she can                 test theories of biological electron transfer processes.  To                    acquire this expertise, Professor Stankovich will collaborate with              Professor Grant Mauk of the University of British Columbia who is               an expert in the area of site directed mutagenesis.                                                                                                             This Career Advancement Award will enable Professor Stankovich to               broaden significantly her research capabilities in the area of                  bioelectrochemistry.  The results of this research could bear                   significantly on the current understanding of biological electron               transfer processes.",
