 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent analyses carried out on spacecraft total solar                      irradiance measurements have shown quite convincingly the                       importance of faculae in active regions and network for                         irradiance variation over the solar cycle.  Also, infrared                      photometry of faculae places new constraints on the mechanisms                  responsible for heating in these magnetic structures.  One                      element of the program funded here consists of accurate                         photometric observations in the infrared to enable a study of the               deepest layers in the structures in more detail.  Comparison of                 the results with mhd models of facular and sunspot flux tubes                   should be a powerful new diagnostic of the mechanisms that lead                 to facular excess brightness.  A second aim is to evaluate the                  contribution of active region and network faculae to total                      irradiance over the solar cycle.  It is intended to use                         photospheric distribution obtained from archival KPNO                           magnetograms, and an empirical relation between their magnetic                  flux and contrast that will be derived through photometry in the                visible and near IR.  The results of these studies should                       considerably advance understanding of solar luminosity modulation               mechanisms and their relation to photospheric magnetic activity.                     The overall aim is to understand solar luminosity variations               as they might apply to terrestrial changes (eg. climate).  Proxy                data might permit reconstruction of solar history in the recent                 past.",
