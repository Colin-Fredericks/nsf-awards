 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to develop a                          methodology to predict the range of capillary pressure-                         saturation relationships for contaminated aquifers.  This                       method will be based on the use of independently derived                        scaling parameters so that if the relationship is known for                     one system, the relationship for another can be obtained                        using this procedure.  Since the interfacial tension and                        the contact angle of the system affects the capillary                           pressure relationships, this dependence needs to be                             examined.  The study will encompass measurements of four                        types of capillary pressure curves, primary drainage,                           spontaneous imbibition, forced imbibition and secondary                         drainage, as well as measurements of interfacial tension                        and contact angles.                                                                                                                                             The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                             response to NSF 88-99, Research Initiation Awards.  The                         project is expected to result in improved ability to                            predict movement of contaminants in aqifers.  Currently,                        there are few capillary pressure measurements available for                     two-phase systems at hazardous waste sites.  This lack of                       data hampers efforts to use models to describe the relevant                     processes and to design effective remediation strategies at                     these sites.  This research would help alleviate that                           problem and reduce the need to make capillary pressure                          measurements for each contaminant and each soil type that                       may be present at waste sites.",
