 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Akif Baha Balantekin of the                   University of Wisconsin, Madison and Professors W. A. Friedman and              K. W. McVoy of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in collaborative                research with Professors E. Chavez, A. Dacal and M. E. Ortiz of the             Instituto de Fisica de la Universidad Autonoma de Mexico (IFUNAM)               in Mexico City, Mexico.  The investigators plan to undertake the                theoretical analysis and interpretation of detailed measurements                involving primary fragments produced in peripheral collisions of                heavy ions at intermediate energies.  The proposed theoretical                  analysis and interpretation of these results is to occur at two                 levels, both of which involve the collaboration of theoretical and              experimental physicists.  The first level is concerned with the                 determination of the characteristics of the primary reaction                    products through a combined consideration of simple reaction                    models, Monte Carlo calculations, and properties of the detection               system.  The second level consists of interpreting the deduced                  cross sections for nucleon pickup and stripping in terms of the                 theories of heavy ion transfer and inelastic scattering.                                                                                                        The proposed work has the potential to increase our understanding               of heavy-ion reaction mechanisms at intermediate energies.  The                 collaboration between Mexican experimentalists and U.S. theoretical             physicists continues past successful work, each side bringing                   complementary skills to a research project of much current                      interest.",
