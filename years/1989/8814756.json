 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research                 project between Dr. Bob B. Buchanan of the University of California,            Berkeley, and Dr. Arpad Balogh of Gyorgy Bessenyei College,                     Nyiregyhaza, is to study cytosolic carbohydrate metabolism in                   uncellular algae.  Specifically, the researchers will examine sucrose           synthesis and breakdown in green alga, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, with              the intent of characterizing three enzymes that function as catalysts           in this interconversion process.  Characterization of the enzymes               envolves determination of their physical properties, including                  molecular weight and kinetic constants.  Knowledge of metabolic                 mechanisms yielded by this study of algae will also contribute to our           understanding of enzyme regulation in higher plants.                                                                                                            This project in metabolic biology fulfills the program objective of             advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United                States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and share            research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
