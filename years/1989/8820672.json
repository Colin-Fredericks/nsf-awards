 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of a sophisticated peptide synthesizer for the                  Bioanalytical Facility at Florida State University will have a                  major impact on the research efforts of both chemists and                       biologists.  For the work of Dr. Cross this capability makes                    possible a far more detailed structural study of membrane bound                 peptides by solid state NMR than has been possible before. These                biophysical studies requiring large samples of isotopically                     labeled peptides will allow for the development of an atomic                    resolution picture of both the three dimensional structure and                  molecular dynamics.  For one this capability will allow for                     studies of the mechanism of action of the collagenase enzymes                   which have a remarkable specificity not only for the amino acid                 sequence but also for supramolecular structural features.  To                   deconvolute these specificity requirements, a wide range of                     peptides will be synthesized to more clearly define the primary                 sequence specificity.  Futhermore it is possible to synthesize                  specific sequences which have certain supramolecular properties.                Another requires synthetic peptides for studying the binding of                 antitumor agents (taxol and taxol analogs) to tublin models.                    While the binding studies are just being initiated this research                project is getting a lot of attention and these studies are a                   very important step in the understanding of the taxol antitumor                 activity.  The biologists, will also be studying synthetic                      segments of large proteins.  One is interested in characterizing                the Luteinizing Hormone Release Inhibiting Factor (LHRIF) as well               as preparing analogs of super active agonists and antagonists.                  Another will be assaying for antibody binding to synthetic                      polypeptides, as well as an ability of the polypeptides to                      inhibit reactivity between antibody and idiotope or allotype-                   bearing Ig molecule.",
