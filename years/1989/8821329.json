 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports visits by two U.S. scientists               from the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and Mississippi              State University to major Indian research institutes for development            of a cooperative program in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).  The            areas to be discussed include:  a) evaluation of solution algorithms            from various different application areas in CFD; b) adaption of                 existing schemes to concurrent computers, and in areas of domain                decomposition, computational Green's function methods, and extension            of fast Poisson solvers to more general problems; c) hybrid and cross           fertilization of existing grid generation methods; d) adaptive or               moving grid systems; and e) evaluation of existing software and                 development of more advanced software for proper visualization and              interpretation of flow field properties.                                                                                                                        Scope:  The topic of updating algorithms to take advantage of major             advances in computer architecture, is an important one.  The                    capabilities in computer technology and computation in the U.S. as in           the case of the Consortium for Computational Fluid Dynamics at UAH,             can be complemented by the analytical and mathematical capabilities             in the top academic and research institutes in India.  This project             will focus primarily on the Drs. S. M. Deshpandy and N. M. Reddy of             the aeronautical Engineering Department.  Additional visits will be             made to the Indian Institutes of Technology in Bombay and Delhi.  The           collaborative projects to be developed, could lead to participation             by U.S. universities other than UAH, and to improvement in the use of           CFD in modeling and investigating three-dimensional flows associated            with realistic aerodynamic propulsion configurations.",
