 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estimates of maximum wind speeds in tornadoes has been made from            theoretical calculations and through indirect means such as structural          damage.  To date, however, direct verification of these speeds has              been sparse.  Some measurements have been made by stationary research           Doppler radars, but the sample size is small and due to radar horizon           problems, no measurements are available near the ground.                            In conjunction with a scientist from the Los Alamos National                Laboratory, the Principal Investigator will use a small portable                Doppler radar to approach tornadoes at a safe, but close, range and             measure wind velocities in the tornado and its near environment.  Even          though tornadoes are rare events, the Principal Investigator, working           with NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory, has been very                    successful in the past in intercepting tornadic storms.                             The collected data will be compared with predictions from various           theories of tornadic formation and will provide, for the first time,            direct verification or refutation of some of these theories.",
