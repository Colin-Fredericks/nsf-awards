 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of inorganic chemistry and                     deals with large clusters of either molybdenum or tungsten                      atoms tied together by oxygen atoms, known as polyoxoanions.                    These species have become the focus of much attention recently                  as models of catalytic metal oxide surfaces, and are also under                 intensive investigation as highly active and versatile                          homogeneous catalysts.                                                                                                                                          Development of reactivity on the surfaces of large                              polyoxoanions of molybdenum and tungsten in aqueous and                         nonaqueous solvents is seen as a way (a) to lead to new classes                 of compounds and homogeneous catalysts and (b) to model                         processes that are important in heterogeneous catalysis on                      metal oxides. \"Activation\" of polyanion surfaces is achieved by                 reduction, e.g. oxomolybdenum(VI) to aquomolybdenum(IV), or by                  synthesis of polyanions containing one or more lower-valent                     heteroatoms in place of W(VI) or Mo(VI). The activated                          polyanions bind a variety of neutral ligands, especially in                     anhydrous solvents. With appropriate choice of heteroatom and                   oxidation state, polyanion-ligand complexes undergo atom                        transfer, either to or from the ligand. This tendency toward                    atom transfer will be used to develop stoichiometric or                         catalytic oxygen atom transfer involving one or several                         adjacent sites on the polyanion surface. An extension of this                   work is expected to lead to rational synthesis of polyanions                    containing terminal multiply-bonded groups other than oxo                       oxygen (e.g. imido, hydrazido) with consequent novel reactivity.",
