 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on forearc sediment transport by turbidity                 currents.  The study area is located south of the Aleutian                      volcanic arc, North Pacific Ocean.  Two important                               sedimentologic phenomena will be addressed:  (1) upslope flow                   of unconfined turbidity currents, and (2) interdigitation                       between transverse influx into the trench and axial flows.                      Upslope sediment transport is an extremely important process to                 consider because it allows bypassing of bathymetric                             obstructions even in the absence of large erosional features                    (i.e., submarine canyons).  Three independent phases of                         research are required to document patterns of forearc sediment                  transport in convincing detail: (1) quantification of detrital                  mineralogy for turbidite sands, and identification of                           provenance; (2) quantification of detrital mineralogy for                       continental shelf sands, and identification of provenance; (3)                  interpretation of bathymetric/seismic data, together with                       GLORIA sonar images, as a means of charting all potential flow                  paths for turbidity currents.                                                   %%%                                                                                                                                                             Turbidity currents represent the single most important physical                 process responsible for transport of sandy epiclastic detritus                  into deep-marine depositional environments.  Future research on                 turbidity currents should concentrate on:  (1) the physical                     character and hydrodynamic evolution of individual flow events;                 and (2) the stratigraphic cyclicity of turbidite deposits                       within specific sub-environments of deposition.  The latter                     goal will be satisfied only through deep ocean drilling.  The                   former goal will be satisfied, in part, by this study.",
