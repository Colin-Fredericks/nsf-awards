 "awd_abstract_narration": "When we help others, is our ultimate goal ever to benefit them                  (altruistic motivation), or is our ultimate goal always some form               of self.benefit (egoistic motivation)?  Considerable evidence                   indicates that feeling empathy (sympathy, compassion) for a                     person in need can increase the motivation to help that person.                 Past research indicates that the motivation to help associated                  with empathic emotion is at least in past altruistic (i.e.,                     directed toward the ultimate goal of increasing the others'                     welfare).                                                                                                                                                       This research will extend earlier work, seeking the psychological               antecedents of the empathy.altruism relationship.  A model is                   presented that identifies two proximal antecedents of empathic                  emotion..perception of the other as in need and valuing the                     other's welfare.  This model is based on recent conceptions of                  emotion that emphasize the central role of value as a                           precondition for emotional response.  Six potential sources of                  valuing another's welfare are then identified, and nine                         experiments are proposed to test (1) the relationship between                   valuing the other's welfare and empathy and (2) the ability of                  each of the proposed sources to induce valuing of the other's                   welfare and, thereby, the empathy.altruism relationship.                                                                                                        These experiments should increase our understanding of the                      conditions under which we feel empathy for a suffering person                   and, as a result, altruistic motivation.  This understanding, in                turn, should take us an important step closer to the development                of empathy.based programs for moral education, therapy, and                     organizational behavior, programs capable of fostering more                     positive social relationships.",
