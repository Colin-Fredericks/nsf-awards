 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Johnson is studying particle structure, stability, and                      assembly in a family of viruses called the tricornaviruses.                     The method of analysis will be primarily X-ray                                  crystallography, although a variety of biochemical methods                      will be employed to produce samples that are suitable for                       crystallization.  Collaborations with experts in molecular                      genetics and spectroscopy will be undertaken to fully exploit                   the crystallographic technique and experiments.  The overall                    goal will be to use these structures to attempt to design                       biophysical, biochemical and molecular genetic experiments                      that address function.                                                                                                                                          Investigations have shown that viruses infecting plants,                        insects and mammals share common structural and functional                      themes although there are remarkable and unexpected                             differences between viruses infecting the same host.                            Understanding viral structures and their relationships to                       function will enable one to relate viruses to each other and to                 their hosts in terms of structural and physical properties at the               molecular level.***",
