 "awd_abstract_narration": "A better understanding of the control of feeding and drinking is                of both theoretical and practical importance.  Disorders of                     ingestion such as obesity and bulimia are major public-health                   problems.  On the theoretical side, ingestive behavior is a model               case of motivated action.  If we understood it, we would better                 understand the more general problem:  What is the brain doing as                it organizes, expresses, and terminates motivated behavior?                                                                                                     The conventional view has been that a bout of feeding ends when                 certain internal \"satiety signals\" reach sufficient strength.                   Dr. Mook's research has shown that this view is oversimplified,                 if not simply wrong.  He finds the following:  (1) An animal can                be satiated for one food and hungry for another at the same time.               (2) Oral stimuli (such as taste) determine which internal signals               the animal will heed and which it will ignore.  (3) Conversely,                 internal signals act by modifying, selectively, the way in which                the animal responds to a given set of oral stimuli.  In short,                  \"satiety\" is not a fixed internal state or signal.  The eating of               a meal is controlled by oral and internal factors in interaction                with each other (and with the animal's learning history, which                  provides yet a third term in the interaction).                                                                                                                  In an animal model, the rat, Dr. Mook has developed techniques                  (a) for permitting feeding to occur with no internal consequences               (\"sham feeding\") and (b) for combining sham feeding with                        manipulation of the animal's internal state prior to or during a                meal that it eats voluntarily.  Using these techniques, he will                 manipulate oral signals, internal signals, and learning history                 independently, and thus attempt to specify how oral, internal,                  and experiential factors interact in controlling the eating of a                meal.  The results will lay the groundwork for investigating how                the interaction is mediated by the brain.",
