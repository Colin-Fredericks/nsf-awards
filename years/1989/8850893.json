 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two overall aims.  The first is to provide high                school teachers and students with a better grasp of the nature of               science and technology, the institutions that support them and                  their place in society, culture, and history.  The second is                    recruitment; the arousal in students of an interest in science                  and engineering as studies and careers worth pursuing.                                                                                                          The project is timely.  It is intended to combat the                            unsatisfactory levels of high school performance in social                      science, humanities, and mathematics revealed by a number of                    well-publicized national reports and studies.  It is also                       intended to address the equally disturbing problem of student                   disenchantment with science, the causes of which originate in the               way in which science is taught in sciences courses and in the way               it is portrayed in the non-science curriculum, and particularly                 history.                                                                                                                                                        The project is developing \"units\" of study that are self-                       contained and keyed to the regular school curriculum and can be                 introduced as appropriate.  Curricular units will include student               readings, teacher manuals, and audio-visual aids, and will be                   constructed separately for science and history.  Equal attention                will be given to physics and biology, and to U. S. and world                    history.  A special feature of the project is the formation of                  historian-scientist pairs of teachers, so that each teacher can                 count on the help of an interested and informed partner.//",
