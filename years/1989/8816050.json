 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little is known about the roles of lipids as specific recognition               molecules although hemagglutination by lipids has been reported                 on several occasions.  The composition, properties, and functions               of lipid and lipoproteoglycan agglutinins, which have been                      isolated from Nereis coelomic fluid and coelomocytes, will                      elucidate their roles in the invertebrate immune response and                   their potential for recognizing specific cell receptors.  While                 studying the phospholipid agglutinins from Nereis, it was                       discovered that aged preparations of synthetic unsaturated                      phosphatidylethanolamines are hemagglutinins.  This observation                 opens up a second route to obtain appreciable quantities of a                   specific class of lipid agglutinin and to define the structural                 requirements which confer activity.  Chemical analysis,                         chromatography (2D-TLC, HPLC) and spectroscopy (MS, FTIR and NMR)               are being used to characterize the components and structures of                 these agglutinins.  Red blood cell (RBC) binding and inhibitor                  profiles and the use of enzymically-modified RBC indicate range                 and specificity of binding.  The effects of these agglutinins on                other kinds of cells are being determined.  Light and electron                  microscopy (EM) are being used to visualize these interactions                  and the structures of the lipid aggregates will be studied using                EM and 31 P NMR (for phospho-lipid agglutinins).  Specific                      receptors on susceptible cells will be isolated.  The information               from these studies will define the structures and aggregation                   state of exogenous lipids which act in a bi- or multi-valent                    manner on specific cell surfaces, suggest what kind of binding is               taking place, predict the behavior of other natural or synthetic                lipids, and suggest ways in which lipids, as reagents, can be                   used in cell manipulation.                                                                                                                                      Cell-surface interactions mediated by lipids have received very                 little attention, although scattered reports have suggested that                lipids may play such a role.  Further study of the role of lipids               and lipoproteoglycan agglutinins in the immune-like defense                     mechanisms of the marine worm, Nereis, promises to provide                      important new insights into the more general role of lipids in                  specific cellular recognition phenomena.",
