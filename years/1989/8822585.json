 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in Dr. Little; laboratory strongly suggest that laminin                 plays a fundamental role in the mesenchymal cell migrations                     during cardiac development. Based on this work, he hypothesizes                 that laminin is one of the components to which mesenchymal cells                adhere during their migration through cell-free regions of the                  early embryonic heart. The general goal of this proposal is to                  investigate this possibility using stage 6-12 chicken embryos.                  Specifically, Dr. Little proposes: 1) To purify chicken laminin                 for immunogen, then to isolate antibodies which recognize the                   various laminin chains (A, B1, B2). 2) to partially characterize                chicken laminin. 3) to use recombinant DNA probes, derived from                 the mouse laminin gene, as a means of isolating hybridization                   probes to the chicken laminin gene. 4) To use the immunological                 and hybridization probes a means of determining the spatial and                 temporal distribution of laminin and its mRNA in early chicken                  hearts. 5) To investigate the cell biological effects of                        perturbing cell surface:laminin adhesion by use of the Tyr-Ile-                 Gly-Ser-Arg (YIGSR) laminin-derived peptide. and 6) To monitor                  cell surface interactions by immunolabeling specific cell                       adhesion molecules (N-CAM, A-CAM and the 67 kDa laminin receptor                molecule) in untreated embryonic hearts, and hearts after                       injection with YIGSR.                                                           %%%                                                                             The developing chicken heart is an excellent model system for                   studying the control of cell migration and adhesion. Cell                       migration and adhesion are driving influences in the embryonic                  development of animals. This study will provide valuable insights               into these processes.",
