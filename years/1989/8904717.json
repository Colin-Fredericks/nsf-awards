 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipoxygenases dioxygenases which catalyze the hydroperoxidation                 of unsaturated fatty acids containing a cis,cis-1,4-pentadiene                  bond system, are found in all eukaryotic organisms.  In mammals                 lipoxygenases play a key role in the production of potent                       biological regulatory molecules with far-ranging physiological                  effects.  These include the prostaglandins, leukotrienes,                       thromboxanes and lipoxins.  The role of lipoxygenases in higher                 plants, however, is not clear although there is evidence that                   lipoxygenases are involved in plant growth and development,                     senescence, wounding and pathogen and pest defense.  To begin to                define the physiological role of lipoxygenase in higher plants                  this research supports a detailed molecular genetic and                         biochemical analysis of the lipoxygenase genes and enzymes of                   Arabidopsis thaliana.  Lipoxygenase cDNA and genomic clones are                 being isolated and characterized.  The resulting clones will be                 used to analyze lipoxygenase under a variety of conditions.                     Lipoxygenase steady-state mRNAs and enzymatic activity will be                  analyzed in different plant organs, during various stages of                    development and in response to light, wounding and \"elicitors\" of               pathogen defense mechanisms.                                                                                                                                    These studies will help to define the physiological role of                     lipoxygenase in higher plants.  These enzymes are important in                  the physiological functioning of plants as they respond to                      environmental stresses.",
