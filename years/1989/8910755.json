 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal examines how to combine the results of database                   models with the intuitive predictions of experts.  The                          project requests funding for the development of a theoretical                   model and for two field site studies, using buyers in retail                    chains, that will compare different methods of combining                        models and experts' forecasts.  These methods are based both                    on mechanical (rule-based) combinations and on various types                    of interactive procedures that allow for the on-line                            adjustment of model forecasts by experts.  The topic is                         inherently complex, due to difficulties associated with                         developing an operational definition of intuition and the                       significance of situational factors in understanding how to                     do a better job of extracting knowledge from experts.                           However, the proposed studies are well defined and relate                       clearly to earlier work in the field.  Moreover, the utility                    of the project is considered to be very high: the use of                        large databases by managers, and decision models calibrated                     on them, continues to grow but there is very little                             theoretical basis for providing guidance on how to combine                      the results of these models with experts' intuitions.  Thus,                    the contribution of this project to forecasting practice and                    to the theory of knowledge-base construction could be                           considerable.",
