 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Dr. Keeley and his Belgian colleague Dr.                     Daniel Cahen to conduct two summers of archaeological fieldwork                 in the drainages of the Geer and Faux Geer rivers in northeastern               Belgium.  Past work has indicated that this region is rich in                   LinearBandKeramik (LBK) sites, and the goal of the team is to                   excavate four of them, two in the center of the LBK region and                  two on the perifery.  Since LBK sites are not deeply buried, the                investigators plan to strip large areas to expose the layout of                 entire settlements.  Individual houses will then be cleared and                 deeper excavation directed to uncovering such features as                       storage pits.  The goal of the research is to determine whether                 these settlements were defended and the extent to which social                  differentiation had taken place within them.                                                                                                                    The LBK cultures in Belgium date to a very brief period, ca.                    6200 - 5900 BC, and represent the first intrusion of farming                    peoples into Belgium.  Until that time the area had been                        inhabited exclusively by hunters and gatherers.  Some sites in                  this region provide evidence of surrounding fortifications                      which imply that hostility existed between the LBK pioneers                     and the prior residents.  This research will examine this issue.                The situation is unusual because in most instances relatively                   harmonious, mutually beneficial relationships are established                   between hunting and gathering and farming peoples.  It is also                  unclear how these first farming communities were organized,                     whether they had an egalitarian or heirarchial social sutructure.               By excavating a number of houses and comparing contents, Drs.                   Keeley and Cahen can investigate this question.                                                                                                                 This research is important because it will shed light on the                    long term interactions between more technologically simple and                  more complex societies.  Such interactions not only characterized               the past but continue to the present time.",
