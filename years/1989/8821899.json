 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of                    Massachusetts, Amherst, supports interactive and inter-                         disciplinary research related to polymer science and                            engineering.  The research is organized into three primary thrust               areas.  Research on pattern formation in polymer systems involves               investigators from chemistry, polymer science and engineering and               chemical engineering and emphasizes the dynamics of pattern                     formation in polymers rather than the morphology itself.  The                   thrust on ordered polymeric solids brings together faculty and                  students from chemistry and from polymer science and engineering                to address questions of order in crystalline and liquid                         crystalline polymers, periodic morphologies in polymer blends and               block copolymers, and synthesis of new polymers with precisely                  defined structures.  Research on polymers in restricted                         geometries addresses polymers at surfaces, thin films, the                      dynamics and behavior of polymers in ordered and disordered                     systems, and transport phenomena, and involves investigators from               physics, chemical engineering, and polymer science and                          engineering.  The MRL also supports the development, operation                  and maintenance of major central materials research facilities on               the Amherst campus, and provides seed funding for new faculty and               high-risk research related to its overall program.  The program                 presently involves 15 faculty members, 5 postdoctoral research                  associates, 2 other technical professionals, 16 graduate students               and 6 undergraduates.  The MRL at the University of                             Massachusetts, Amherst, is under the direction of Professor Shaw                Ling Hsu.",
