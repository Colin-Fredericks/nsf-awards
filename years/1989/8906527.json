 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of Frankia as a nitrogen fixer in soils, and                the future of Frankia in the area of silviculture is of                         ecological significance.  This proposal will focus on the                       saprophytic growth and the influence of the rhizosphere on                      metabolic activity of Frankia.  A conceptual model distinguishing               physiological classes of Frankia in soil will guide testing of                  the hypothesis that Frankia can grow saprophytically in soil.                   Methods that quantify changes in the Frankia population (biomass)               as well as infective units in soil, will include use of DNA                     probes and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)                      analysis to identify and trace a Frankia strain inoculated at low               levels into a non-sterile soil system.  Polymerase chain                        reactions as a means to increase the sensitivity of such methods                will be used.  The experiment to test for Frankia  saprophytic                  competence involves inoculation of non-sterile soil at low levels               with a pure culture of a spore-negative type of Frankia in the                  alder compatability group.  Changes in its population biomass                   (DNA content) and numbers of infective units (MPN bioassay) with                time will be measured.  Variables include rhizosphere vs. non-                  rhizosphere soil for three plant species: red alder, yellow birch               and Douglas-fir, to test if rhizosphere soil of host or non-host                plants promote saprophytic growth of Frankia.  The role of spores               as infective units will be examined by experiments to test                      whether rhizosphere stimulates spore germination.",
