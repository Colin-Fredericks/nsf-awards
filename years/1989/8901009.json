 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this work will be on the investigation of a                   class of solutions of fully nonlinear partial differential                      equations.  A comprehensive theory of these solutions (known as                 viscosity solutions) for second order equations is rapidly                      evolving.  Uniqueness, regularity and comparison results have                   been achieved.  Work to be done on this project will continue                   the development of the theory in the direction of obtaining                     extensions of the maximum principle for viscosity solutions of                  the fully nonlinear equations.                                                       Viscosity solutions, a type of weak solution, were first                   introduced in 1983 for first order equations.  The concept is                   motivated by the weak maximum principle which distinguishes it                  from other definitions of weak solution such as those depending                 on integration by parts.  Viscosity solutions always agree with                 classical solutions when they exist.  On the other hand, it is                  possible that they may only be semicontinuous and not                           differentiable.  Such properties are particularly useful when                   one is considering limits of sequences of solutions.  Because                   these solutions are obtained by a method of vanishing viscosity,                they also lay claim to being the correct physical solution where                appropriate.                                                                         The present work will continue studies of different                        versions and extensions of the classical maximum principle                      applied to viscosity solutions, including problems involving                    discontinuous boundary data.  Efforts will also be made in                      treating singular perturbations which arise naturally in several                contexts such as differential games determined by stochastic                    optimization problems with risk averse utility functions.  Other                applications will be made to problems in stochastic control.                    Two specific areas include the problem of characterizing a                      stochastic process which jumps between  diffusion processes and                 questions arising in option pricing and risk averse financial                   systems.",
