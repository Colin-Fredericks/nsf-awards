 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing evidence of hydrothermal processes in layered                  mafic intrusives (LMI) has brought to the forefront the question                of aqueous transport of platinum-group elements (PGE).  We                      propose to pursue an integrated theoretical and petrologic study                of PGE mobility in hydrothermal solutions.  An internally                       consistent set of thermodynamic data for aqueous PGE ions and                   complexes will be developed using recent advances in theoretical                geochemistry.  These data will be employed in calculations to                   establish the speciation of PGE in solution, and solubility of                  platinum-group minerals (PGM) over a large range of geologic                    conditions.  Mass transfer calculations will allow incorporation                of petrologic  constraints, together with thermodynamic data, in                order to identify which factors control PGM dissolution and                     reprecipitation during hydrothermal events associated with LMI.                 Petrologic constraints will be drawn from concurrent research on                the Duluth Complex in Dr. Pasteris' lab, ongoing research by                    Dennis Bird on the Skaergaard Intrusive, and literature reports                 on the Bushveld and Stillwater Complexes.  Expected results                     include:  predicted dissociation constants for PGE-complexes of                 chloride, hydroxide, and other major ligands; predicted                         solubilities of PGM as functions of temperature, pressure, oxygen               fugacity, total chloride, and pH; and increased understanding of                the possible role of supercritical aqueous solutions in the                     redistribution of PGE in LMI and other hydrothermal environments.",
