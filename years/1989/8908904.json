In                    particular, combination of the Wisconsin group's expertise on the               ionic basis for depolarization of vascular and muscle cells,                    combined with the Hungarians'expertise on the biomechanics of the               blood vessel wall, is expected to lead to improved understanding of             venous myogenicity (the extent to which venous pressure causes                  contraction of the vein wall), the scientific basis of which is                 virtually unknown.  Improved understanding of this phenomenon is                crucial for defining the basic mechanisms which regulate vascular               compliance in the cardiovascular system.",
