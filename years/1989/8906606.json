 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vision is a dominant human sense, but so complex that traditional               research has concentrated on either the optical system of the                   eye, or the neurobiology of the retina and brain, or the                        psychology of visual perception.  Recently there has been more                  interest in trying to synthesize new principles using a variety                 of approaches.                                                                                                                                                  This symposium addresses vision in a multidisciplinary way, with                perspectives from the worlds of optics, of physiology, and of                   perceptual psychology.  The two central questions addressed are:                1) How is visual processing limited by properties of optics and                 photoreceptors of the eye?  2) How do behavioral measures of eye                movements or perception relate to activity of cells in the visual               cortex of the brain?  While covering relatively few topics, with                speakers of high caliber, this symposium will touch a relatively                large and diverse audience both at the site and by the subsequent               publication.  The effort made to communicate the success of these               diverse, powerful approaches is likely to have considerable                     impact on many young visual scientists, in addition to generating               healthy controversy among those more established.",
