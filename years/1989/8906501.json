 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project would establish Hunter College as a node                 on NYSERNET and as a consequence, a node on NSFNET.  The nearest                NYSERNET node is at the University Computer Center (UCC) of                     CUNY.  A dedicated T1 line between Hunter College and the                       computer service is already in operation.  Thus, the project                    requires the purchase of an IP router at both ends of the line,                 as well as additional cards to the multiplexers at both ends of                 the line.                                                                         Once the connection is established, researchers using computers               can exchange data with any other NSFNET site with great ease.  It               also significantly facilitates data transfer between the                        mainframes at the UCC and minis with powerful graphics                          capabilities.  Finally, it provides remote log-in capabilities                  from Hunter College computers to supercomputer centers and allows               for quick tranfer of results to local computers for analysis.***//",
