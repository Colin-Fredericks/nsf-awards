 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of her doctoral dissertation research, Ms. Melinda Allen                will conduct an archaeological and geological survey of the West                coast of Aitutaki Island in the Southern Cooks Islands.  She will               lay out transects running from the coast inland, and conduct test               excavations as well as an auger survey.  Additional excavation                  will take place in areas discovered to have high archaeological                 potential.  The data collected will permit a reconstruction of                  the geological history of Aitutake and provide information on the               island's earliest inhabitants.                                                                                                                                  The Polynesian islands, many separated from each other by long                  stretches of water, were rapidly colonized from West to East by a               seafaring people.  While the general outline of the colonization                is clear, many of the specifics remain unresolved.  In particular               it is not known whether the ocean between Western and Eastern                   Polynesia provided a major barrier and if so, how long it took to               cross.  The Southern Cooks lie at the Western extremity of                      Eastern Polynesia.  Although they have not as yet yielded                       relevant sites Ms. Allen believes that a variety of                             geomorphological processes would have led to deposition of                      sediment in the most likely areas of early habitation and thus                  sites are buried.  In this research she will determine                          depositional history of Aitutaki and try to locate early remains.                                                                                               This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of the role mobility and migration play in human                  adaptation.  If successful it will also provide archaeologists                  with clues of where and how to look for such sites on other                     Pacific islands.",
