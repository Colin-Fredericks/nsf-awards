 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve the soil science curriculum at the               University of Minnesota, Waseca (UMW) through the use of                        analytical equipment.  The new equipment will greatly enhance                   instruction in the areas of soil testing and plant analysis, soil               fertility, and basic soil science.  Upon graduation, virtually                  all students in the various majors of agriculture and                           horticulture at UMW will have to develop soil fertility programs                that are economically viable and environmentally sound.  Students               need a thorough understanding of the tests used to evaluate the                 fertility status of soils and plant tissue.  They also need to                  understand the movement of nutrient ions through the soil and the               potential for contamination of surface and groundwater.                         Effective teaching of these concepts must take place in a                       laboratory setting with appropriate instrumentation.  Instruments               to be utilized in the project include an atomic absorption                      spectrophotometer to analyze soil and plant extracts for K, Ca,                 Mg and micronutrients; a fiber-optic colorimeter to measure                     phosphorous; a nitrate electrode and pH/ISE meter to determine                  nitrate levels in soil and water samples; and a microwave system                for digestion and ashing of plant tissue.  The equipment will be                used by students in regular classes and by high-ability students                conducting undergraduate research projects.                                                                                                                          The University will match the award with an equal amount of                funds.",
