 "awd_abstract_narration": "Educational Development Center's proposed project, Improving Urban              Middle School Science, is a multidisciplinary science program for the           seventh and eighth grade that is targeted to the needs of early                 adolescents in urban environments.  Modules integrate scientific                concepts and understandings from the physical, human and health, life,          and earth sciences within the context of science, society, and                  technology problems.  This project will build on the conceptual                 framework and pedagogical strategies, school district partnerships,             teacher training design, and assessment and publishing partnerships             established through the NSF-funded Improving Urban Elementary Science           Project currently under development at EDC and Sunburst Communications.         School districts and teachers in Boston, Cleveland, Los Angeles, San            Francisco, Baltimore, and Montgomery County, Maryland will collaborate          fully in the development effort and field-testing.  Operation SMART, a          research and development project of the Girls Clubs of America, will            consult on informal science education strategies which are particularly         responsive to urban youth and which will complement the curriculum.  The        materials will be reviewed for scientific accuracy and pedagogical              soundness by a distinguished advisory panel, while field-testing and            evaluation will be conducted by the Boston College Center for the Study         of Testing, Evaluation, and Educational Policy (CSTEEP).  Sunburst              Communications, Inc. will publish the final product and field test              materials, contribute to a Teacher Development Fund, and provide                technical assistance throughout the project to ensure marketability of          the proposed modules.",
