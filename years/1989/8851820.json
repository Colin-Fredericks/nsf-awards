 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate students currently struggle to understand the                     importance and utility of frequency domain analysis due to a lack               of equipment to demonstrate key concepts.  This project seeks to                alleviate this major weakness by providing students with                        laboratory experiences in the characterization of signals in the                frequency domain and in the measurement of network frequency                    response characteristics.  The equipment consists of function                   generators for producing signals and dynamic signal analyzers                   which display frequency domain magnitude and phase information for              signals and systems.  This equipment will be used in a required                 introductory laboratory course to confirm phasor analysis                       concepts, to study Fourier series, and to develop an understanding              of basic filters.  Of equal importance, the equipment will be used              by students in a three semester design course where they propose,               implement, and document some electrical apparatus of their                      choosing.  Additionally, the equipment will be used to support the              development of laboratories for undergraduate control systems and               analog filters courses, and for classroom demonstrations.",
