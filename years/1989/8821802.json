 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objectives of this proposal are: (1) To determine atomic               structure of real quasicrystals; (2) To identify kinetic and                    equilibrium factors responsible for quasicrystal formation and                  stability; (3) To characterize nature of disorder in                            quasicrystals.  The average quasiperiodic structure of observed                 quasicrystals will be determined, and its utility vis-a-vis                     icosahedral glass models assessed, using the available                          diffraction data and novel approach of exploiting structural                    similarity of crystal approximants.  Accurate determination of                  the structure is a necessary prerequisite for calculations of                   other physical quantities.  Quasicrystal stability and formation                will be investigated through classical cohesive energy,                         variational thermodynamic potentials, and simulations of freezing               of 2D and icosahedral liquids.  The results will also expand the                understanding of kinetic and equilibrium pattern formation                      in general.  Phase fluctuations and more general disorder in                    quasicrystals will be studied in the context of the growth of                   Penrose tilings, in hard-disk and random tiling models, and in                  terms of the freezing of 2D and icosahedral liquids.                            Understanding of growth induced disorder and phase fluctuations                 is not only crucial in the case of quasicrystals, but will also                 have important ramifications in theories of glasses.",
