 "awd_abstract_narration": "Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral Sciences is involved in               a major effort aimed at increasing the participation of                         minorities, notably blacks, in the earth-related mineral,                       materials and geoscientific fields. In particular, black                        participation in fields such as geology, petroleum engineering,                 meteorology, geophysics, ceramic engineering, metals engineering,               and mining engineering has been low historically and presently                  remains so. The College has developed a close working                           relationship with two Pittsburgh schools serving substantial                    numbers of minorities, George Westinghouse High School and Perry                Traditional Academy, and with the Westinghouse Corporation which                has provided joint support for previous activities involving                    research experiences for minority students on the Penn State                    campus.                                                                                                                                                         This Model Project is designed to further the full                              implementation of these cooperative efforts by expanding both the               range of opportunities available and the numbers of students                    impacted by the Penn State initiatives directed at research and                 other motivational experiences for minority students.                                                                                                           Under the auspices of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences                 (EMS), fifty junior and senior high school minority students are                involved in research projects in geosciences and mineral                        engineering under the supervision of EMS research scientists. The               projects are conducted at on-campus sites and at the Wallops                    Island, Virginia, Marine Science Consortium facility. Primary                   objectives are: to create an atmosphere which will stimulate                    students to think creatively; for students to develop an                        appreciation for the various approaches which can be brought to                 bear on problems in science and engineering; to impress upon                    students not only the interdisciplinary nature of many problems,                but the need for cooperation to solve them; for students to                     experience the thrill of discovery and the satisfaction of                      formulating solutions.                                                                                                                                          These objectives will be achieved through two sequential                        activities for the students: a one-week orientation and                         introduction to research, held on the Penn State Campus and                     supported by the Westinghouse Corporation, followed by a two-week               research experience either on campus or at the facilities of the                Marine Science Consortium at Wallops Island, Virginia, of which                 Penn State is a full member.                                                                                                                                    Research topics for the on-campus activities include Petroleum                  Recovery: Technology of Drilling Oil/Gas Wells and Producing                    Petroleum from the Earth, and Technological Approaches to                       Environmental Issues Associated with Coal Production and                        Utilization. Field research at Wallops Island will center around                studies of the biological and physical processes controlling the                geochemistry of Chincoteague Bay.                                                                                                                               This is a noteworthy project, especially in its focus on the                    earth and mineral sciences, in which minorities are particularly                underrepresented. Significant joint support is being provided by                the Westinghouse Corporation.",
