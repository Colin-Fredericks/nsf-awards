 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in                                     aerodynamics by Cesar Farell of the University of                               Minnesota and Raphael Guarga of the University of the                           Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay.  They will study the                           aerodynamic characteristics of boundary layers in wind                          tunnels and various aspects of tunnel design.                                   Atmospheric wind tunnels have been built in both the                            Hydraulic Laboratory in Minnesota and at the School of                          Engineering in Montevideo.  Basic design research will                          be carried out on components of open and closed                                 circuit tunnels.  Inlets, diffusers and their effect                            on flow quality will be investigated along with                                 turbulence management using pressure tubes, anemometry                          and flow visualization.  Data from both tunnels will                            be compared with current models of the aerodynamics of                          structures, energy conservation and effect on                                   pedestrians.                                                                                                                                                    The growth of wind tunnel research and wind                                     engineering in Uruguay will benefit from this work as                           will the capacity to train and use scientists and                               engineers.  The U.S. will benefit through added                                 manpower and a broadened work scope of different                                component geometries and scales.  Thus the goal of the                          SDC program of mutual benefit to both will be                                   fulfilled.",
