 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research effort is to develop modeling               and control methodologies that provide a broad science base for                 planning and scheduling advanced manufacturing systems.  Relevant               achievements in operations research, control and simulation                     theory as well as artificial intelligence and flexible computer                 aided environments will be extended.  Recognizing the complexity                of advanced manufacturing systems which renders the integration                 of manufacturing elements into a manufacturing system                           analytically intractable, a systematic hierarchical decomposition               methodology that addresses the needs of today's manufacturing                   environment will be developed.  This methodology will provide the               capability to decompose the large, complex and generally                        intractable problem of planning and scheduling a manufacturing                  facility to many smaller and tractable generic tasks.                           Development of control policies, simulation and artificial                      intelligence based design tools to address these generic tasks is               also proposed.  The long term objective (in the next five years)                is to create an integrated collection of complementary tools that               will be capable to make use of information in real-time to adjust               production planning and scheduling so that disruptions and                      uncertainties are treated as a normal part of the production                    routine.",
