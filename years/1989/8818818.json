 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative              research project in coordination chemistry between Dasan Radanovic              Svetozar Markovic University, Kragujevac, Yugoslavia and Bodie E.               Douglas, University of Pittsburgh, is to use circular dichroism                 (CD) (crystals) as a stereochemical probe in order to obtain more               information about the structure and function of certain metal ions              in enzymes important to the optical activity.  Past collaboration               has resulted in numerous parallel and joint publications.  The                  crystal samples will be developed by Dr. Radanovic's research                   group.  The analytical work will take place at the University of                Pittsburgh.                                                                                                                                                     This grant was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                     Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint             fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and                     Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually               by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are              made to the principal Yugoslav institute.  Dollar funds are                     included for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav               scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
