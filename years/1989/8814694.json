 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfields of semiconductor electro-                        chemistry and photochemistry.  Mechanistic aspects of                           interfacial electron transfer at the semiconductor-electrolyte                  interface will be investigated experimentally in order to test                  current theories of junction behavior.  In addition, chemical                   control of electron-hole recombination sites will be                            investigated.  The reactivity of the electrically important                     surface trapping sites at etched silicon and gallium arsenide                   surfaces will be studied by investigating the chemistry and                     resultant physical properties of semiconductor surfaces in                      reactions with substitution-labile transition metal complexes.                  Spectroscopic studies of the semiconductor-complex interaction                  will be performed to elucidate the metal oxidation state,                       coordination shell, and electronic properties of the modified                   surface.  Photoelectrochemical passivation of silicon surfaces                  will be studied.  Electron transfer kinetics under high                         injection conditions in crystalline and amorphous silicon will                  be also be investigated.                                                                                                                                        Experiments with carefully prepared semiconductor surfaces will                 be performed in order to deduce relations between the surface                   concentration of majority carriers and the rate of interfacial                  electron transfer.  Chemical information regarding electrically                 important surface sites will be obtained.  These results will                   provide information basic to the understanding of the                           processing of semiconductors for electronic devices and solar                   energy conversion.",
