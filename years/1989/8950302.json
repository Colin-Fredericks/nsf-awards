 "awd_abstract_narration": "The underachievement of Black and Hispanic students in precollege               mathematics is seriously undermining the potential talent pool                  for the future challenges in science and technology.  This                      project is a comprehensive model effort to demonstrate and                      further develop a system of mathematics instruction that gives                  all students the opportunity to enroll in and achieve in the                    precollege mathematics requisite for college study in science and               engineering.  The model project is based on the action research                 and development of the Comprehensive Math & Science Program                     (CMSP), a collaborative project effort which has created                        curriculum and instructional models that have significantly                     increased the pool of students at participant schools in New York               City and Fulton County, Georgia who enroll and achieve in                       precollge mathematics.                                                                                                                                          The model project will be demonstrated over a four-year period in               six districts:  New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C., Seattle,               Los Angeles and Fulton County in Georgia.  Over 7,500 students                  from 30 high schools in the six school districts will participate               in the model project.  All of the students will be selected at                  random and their academic performance and persistence will be                   carefully monitored with standardized tests; and comparisons will               be made at city, state and national levels.  By virtue of                       substantially increased learning times, structured programs and a               greater reliance on students for their own learning, significant                gains in mathematics achievement are expected to occur.  The                    CMSP's long collaboration with a coalition of university-based                  precollege programs operating in urban school districts will                    facilitate project implementation.                                                                                                                              The effectiveness of the CMSP has been validated through the                    extensive data collection and analysis done since its inception.                CMSP students have consistently out performed non-CMSP students,                and have been more able to perform at grade level though high                   school.   During the 1983-84 academic year, CMSP looked at the                  number of students enrolled in the CMSP program and at the non-                 CMSP students in six participating schools.  These students were                again surveyed during the 1986-67 year when they would be                       seniors.  Of the CMSP students, 26% were still in school at grade               level, while only 18% of the non-CMSP students remained and were                at grade level.  When students in tow of the schools took the New               State Algebra Regents Examination, the percentages for CMSP                     students passing the exam were 99% and 90%; the non-CMSP students               percentages were 80% and 66%.  Clearly, this project has                        developed an intervention strategy that is effective.",
