 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of                separating clay and short pulp fibers contained in sludges                      produced during the papermaking-process and to determine                        whether the separated clay can be reused in the process.  This                  project offers the potential of reducing the amount of sludges                  that need to be further processed and/or placed in disposal                     sites where they could unfavorably impact quality of surface                    and groundwater.  The proposal leading to this award was                        submitted in response to the NSF 88-8, Program Solicitation for                 Small Business Innovation Research.                                                                                                                             This research, being conducted with the cooperation of the                      Institute of Paper Chemistry, if successful would complement                    previous work that resulted in a process for removal of the                     long-fiber fractions of the sludge for reuse as a pulp                          substitute.  The overall impact of these concepts if fully                      successful would be to convert an estimated 4 million tons per                  year of waste materials into useful resources and reduce the                    unfavorable effect alternative waste management concepts have                   on environmental resources.",
