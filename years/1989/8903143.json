 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large part of the energy currency of living systems is stored in              phosphodiester bonds and released through metal-catalyzed phosphate             hydrolysis.  Thus, it is of fundamental importance to understand the            nature of metal-phosphate bonding and the mechanism of metal-promoted           phosphate hydrolysis.  Substitution inert transition metals such as Co          and Rh are extremely valuable as model systems of the biologically              active metals which are too labile for structural and mechanistic               studies.  Two key advantages of Rh(III) over Co(III) are the                    following:  Rh(III) complexes are extremely inert and should allow us           to isolate and characterize analogs of reaction intermediates which             have been proposed for the Co(III) systems.  Second, Rh will provide            important structural and mechanistic information in NMR studies both            by direct observation of the 103Rh nucleus and by coupling to other             nuclei in the system.  Dr. Torres will synthesize, isolate and                  characterize Rh(III) complexes of the type \u0131RhLnPx! where L=ligand              P=phosphate with mono-, di-, and triphosphate ligands and with                  nucleotides (ANP, GNP, CNP and UNP).  She will elucidate the                    phosphate-metal coordination and isolate and characterize key                   intermediates in the phosphate hydrolysis reaction.                                                                                                             Dr. Torres will lecture in the advanced inorganic and bioinorganic              chemistry courses and organize a symposium through the Chemistry                Department and the Women's Studies program of the Graduate Institute.           Female chemists from industry, government and academia will be invited          to present their research work to undergraduate students, and to                discuss career opportunities and choices for women in science.  In              addition, she will collaborate with the Women's Section of the                  American Chemical Society in Atlanta in their youth (junior and senior          high school) activities program.                                                                                                                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
