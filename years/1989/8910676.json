 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed study is to extend a data base                 that was initially developed to examine the extent to which                     technological innovations in various industries have been                       dependent on recent academic research.  The extended data base                  would identify the academic groups and institutions which were                  responsible for research that led to major industrial advances,                 determine sources of financial support at various stages of the                 research as well as the sources of ideas for these projects.                    Data would be obtained on about 50 to 100 innovations identif-                  ied by 40 or 50 firms as leading to new products or processes                   that would not have been developed without academic research.                        The results of this study should provide valuable                          information to science policy makers. New information will be                   available on the types of research groups and kinds of                          universities that have been relatively successful in promoting                  significant industrial innovation and whether they have been                    the most highly rated in the relevant discipline.  Given the                    current emphasis on the role of science and technology in                       promoting economic growth and the competitiveness of American                   industry, it should be helpful to know whether certain funding                  agencies, foundation, or firms have supported a disproportion-                  ate share of research leading to industrial innovation.  The                    results will also address the extent to which targeted or un-                   targeted research is  more productive of findings important for                 innovation.",
