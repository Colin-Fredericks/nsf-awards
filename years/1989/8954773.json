 "awd_abstract_narration": "Children's Television Workshop proposes to produce a fourth and                 fifth season of SQUARE ONE TV, a daily series on mathematics for                children ages eight to twelve.  Season Four will consist of 40                  new half-hours for air on PBS stations beginning September 1991.                                                                                                Consistent with CTW's experimental mission in education, CTW also                                                                                               proposes to undertake a new programming approach to expand the                  reach of SQUARE ONE TV to a family audience by converting the                   daily detective serial featured in the series, MATHNET, into four                                                                                               one-hour specials for family viewing.  These Season Four MATHNET                Specials will be researched to test their effectiveness.  Eleven                hour-long weekly SQUARE ONE TV programs will be produced for                    Season Five to be aired in addition to re-broadcasts of the daily                                                                                               series starting January, 1993.                                                                                                                                  Seasons Four and Five production will capitalize on the                         educational impact and appeal of prior seasons.  Mathematical                   content will be based on research and in conjunction with the                   Series Advisory Committee and consultants. The additional seasons                                                                                               will be supported by a full range of promotion, community                       outreach activities, and school services, including teacher's                   guides.",
