 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial harvest of yellow perch in the Great Lakes                      region cannot meet market demand.  Additional controls being                    placed on commercial harvest, consumer demand, and high yellow                  perch prices have generated renewed interest in perch                           aquaculture.  Attempts to establish commercial perch culture                    have faced three major constraints:  1) seasonal supply of                      fingerlings, 2) feeding fry practical feeds, and 3) providing                   optimum growth conditions.  Stunted 8 to 13 cm perch could be                   harvested from wild populations or raised in farm ponds to                      provide a year-round source of larger fish for intensive                        culture causing waste heat.  Various loading and density rates                  will be tested to determine optimal rates.  A cost effective                    practical feed and feed management strategy will be developed                   for the culture of yellow perch.  Stocks of yellow perch                        fingerlings will be identified or established to provide a                      year-round supply for a commercial yellow perch aquaculture                     facility.  A suitable site will be identified for the design,                   construction, and operation of a yellow perch culture                           demonstration project.  A preliminary economic analysis will be                 initiated, utilizing data generated from research results.",
