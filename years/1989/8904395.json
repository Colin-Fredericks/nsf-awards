 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sequence reactions initially involved in fatty acid                         biosynthesis in plants must be reevaluated in light of the                      discovery that there is in spinach a previously unreported 3-                   ketoacyl-ACP synthase (sc-KAS).  This enzyme is specific for                    short chain fatty acids and can be distinguished from other 3-                  ketoacyl-ACP synthases by its sensitivity to the antibiotics                    cerulenin and thiolactomycin.  Based on work carried out with E.                coli, as well as this work with spinach, there is strong evidence               that this enzyme replaces in this sequence the enzyme acetyl                    transacylase, a proposed rate-limiting reaction in fatty acid                   synthesis.  The objectives of this proposal are an extensive                    biochemical analysis of sc-KAS from spinach and isolation of the                structural gene for sc-KAS.  While the regulation of fatty acid                 biosynthesis in plants is poorly understood, there is in vitro                  evidence that the initial reactions of the sequence can influence               the fatty acid composition of the products.  The sc-KAS may play                a critical role in this process and be the key to our                           understanding of regulation.                                                                                                                                    For the past 25 years, fatty acid biosynthesis has been                         illustrated as a series of reactions catalyzed by the enzyme                    complex, fatty acid synthase.  According to the pathway, the                    enzyme, acetyl transacylase is a key rate-limiting enzyme in this               reaction.  However, the discovery of the enzyme, 3-ketoacyl-ACP                 synthase, is challenging this series of reactions.  It is                       believed that the latter enzyme is responsible for the step                     currently thought to be catalyzed by acetyl transacylase,                       contrary to the accepted dogma of fatty acid biosynthesis.  This                is a significant discovery that will be investigated through                    purification,characterization, and examination of the regulation                of this enzyme.  Understanding the role of this enzyme in fatty                 acid synthesis is of importance, particularly in the production                 of oilseed crops.  If expression of this enzyme can be controlled               through genetic engineering, there is the potential for over-                   production of fatty acids.  Even if only a small increase in oil                content could be achieved, it would have a major economic impact.",
