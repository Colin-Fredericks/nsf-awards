 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the topic has been a principal focus of                           meteorological studies for decades, cyclogenesis, both in the                   tropics and extratropics, is far from being well understood.                    Further, the exact conditions that determine whether cyclones                   become intense storms or, in the tropics, hurricanes are not                    known.                                                                               Under this award, the principal investigator, Dr. Emanuel,                 will investigate cyclogenesis from a number of aspects,                         employing both observational and theoretical methods.  His                      participation in the field phase of ERICA (Experiment on                        Rapidly Intensifying Cyclones in the Atlantic) will allow him                   to test his hypothesis that extratropical storm intensification                 is due to wind-dependent flux of sensible and/or latent heat                    from the ocean surface.  He also will explore the dynamics of                   continental cyclones by analyzing the roles of potential                        vorticity and surface temperature.  On the topic of tropical                    cyclogenesis, Dr. Emanuel will continue his research to                         identify a threshold which governs hurricane intensification as                 well as develop a new diagnostic model based on angular                         momentum coordinates for simulating hurricanes.                                      This research is very likely to substantially advance our                  understanding of cyclones and, ultimately, to improve their                     prediction.  Dr. Emanuel is one of the best young scientists in                 the field and well known for his innovative approaches to                       research.",
