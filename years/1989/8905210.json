In this preliminary                              research, recovery of the virus will be investigated by                         use of positively charged depth filters, a technique                            that has been shown to absorb virus particles at or                             nearly a neutral pH.  Positive results of detection                             procedures will be confirmed by use of tissue culture                           when applicable or by restriction analysis and                                  subsequent gel electrophoresis to visualize the viral                           constituents or metabolic products.                                                                                                                             This project is being supported under the NSF Program                           of Expedited Awards for Novel Research.  Results of                             this project are expected to assist in determination of                         the impact that potential contamination of water by the                         HIV-virus can have on the engineering design of                                 processes and systems for disinfection and                                      decontamination of environmental resources.",
