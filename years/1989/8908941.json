 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growing awareness of the accelerating pace of global environmental         change has heightened the need for effective means to monitor and               analyze changes in natural conditions throughout the world.  Satellite          imagery and other forms of remote sensing have greatly increased the            amount of raw data available for tracing changes in natural conditions,         but techniques for converting that data in useful information necessary         to evaluate changes in natural patterns and processes have been slower          to develop.  This project will improve and refine methods for measuring         changes in many of the attributes of vegetation in arid and semiarid            regions.  By evaluating the reflectance properties and locational               patterns of different types of vegetation, the investigator should be           able to develop standard rules that will enable remotely sensed images          across larger areas to be used to more accurately map vegetational              patterns.  By analyzing images of the same area taken over time,                changes in vegetational patterns can be mapped and more direct analyses         of the processes of vegetational change can be undertaken.  This                project will be undertaken by the collaborator in collaboration with            ecologists at the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Reserve in New Mexico.                This research will be beneficial from both methodological and              substantive standpoints.  The analysis of properties that more                  reliably identify vegetation will be of value to all scholars studying          vegetational patterns.  By using this information to improve and test           models of ecosystem change, this research also will benefit those               seeking to increase understandings of the roles of a wide range of              factors in ecological change.",
