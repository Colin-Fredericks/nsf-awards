 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. William F.           Pickard of Washington University and Dr. Peter E. H. Minchin, Physics           and Engineering Laboratory, Department of Scientific and Industrial             Research (DSIR), Lower Hutt, New Zealand.  The investigators intend             to test the hypothesis that phloem (the principle food conducting               tissur in plants) transport might be regulated by sharply dropping              the temperature of the calicum channels in the phloem plasma membrane.          Progress has been slow in characterizing the calcium channels in                plants, and this research should help in understanding the nature and           importance of these channels.                                                                                                                                   The project continues collaboration of these scientists who initially           discovered that momentary interruption of phloem transport was                  sensitive to temperature variations.  The facilities of the DSIR                include unique access to carbon isotopes, which will be used to                 monitor, in real time, transport profiles in the phloem of several              plants.  The research should add considerably to basic knowledge of             phloem physiology.  Ultimately, the results should be of agricultural           significance since they relate to plant ability to withstand insect             predation.",
