 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mudstones constitute most of the fill of sedimentary basins,               yet they are the least understood of all sedimentary rocks.  They               are \"blamed\" for virtually all reactions that cannot be easily                  explained, based on the examination of other rocks.  For example,               they have been advanced as sources for Pb-Zn mineralization, for                SiO2, Fe++, and Mg+ in sandstone cements, and for H+ for                        subsurface leaching of sandstones.  Currently available data in                 Gulf Coast Cenozoic sections dispute all these inferences.                           Using available drill cuttings, we propose to characterize                 changes in:  1) whole-rock major and minor (esp. Sr, Ba, B, and                 Li) elemental and isotopic (esp. O, Sr, B, and Li) chemistry, 2)                carbonate mineralogy and geochemistry, 3) feldspar mineralogy and               geochemistry, and 4) quartz morphology and geochemistry.  We will               quantitatively document changes in mudstones with depth in South                Texas where extensive data on sandstone petrography and                         geochemistry, and formation water geochemistry, already exist.                  By studying a dip section through the growth-faulted depocenters,               we can minimize the vagaries of local and temporally restricted                 sedimentation.  Quantitative material balances in this area will                enable us to assess the importance of mudstone diagenesis to the                diagenetic evolution of sedimentary basins and assess the                       magnitude of import form underlying and export to overlying                     strata.",
