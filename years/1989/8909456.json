 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent observations of the atmosphere and ocean have suggested                  that the atmospheric input of mineral dust is a significant                     source of iron the the euphotic zone in much of the ocean.  In                  some regions with high concentrations of major nutrients such                   as nitrate, phosphate and silicate, the supply of iron from the                 atmosphere is insufficient to allow phytoplankton growth that                   would otherwise develop.  In this study the effect of                           atmospheric iron on phytoplankton growth, the influence of                      other metals also present in the sea and their interaction with                 iron, and the  processing of iron by phytoplankton will be                      examined.                                                                       %%%                                                                                                                                                             Growth of plants in the sea depends upon the presence and                       amount of fertilizer, just as growth of land plants requires                    fertilizer.  In recent months observations of the atmosphere                    and the ocean have suggested that iron concentrations in the                    sea may be governed by input from atmospheric dust.  Iron is                    necessary for plant growth, and thus the cycles by which iron                   is added to the oceans and its interaction with other metals in                 the sea and with the plants of the sea, are potentially major                   factors governing plant growth and biomass in the upper layers                  of the ocean.  This study addresses both plant utilization of                   metals and metal concentrations and interactions in the sea.",
