The               Symposium is being sponsored by the International Glaciological                 Society, with co-sponsorship from the American Geophysical Union and            the American Meteorological Society.  It will be concerned with                 natural forms of ice on land and sea with focus on, (1) information             obtained from ice about climate processes and past climates, (2)                physical processes by which ice influences climate change, and (3)              practical means by which ice effects can be incorporated into                   large-scale climate models.  The goal is to achieve a cross-coupling            between snow, ice and climate scientists and it is expected that the            papers presented at the symposium will provide the most recent                  information on climate reconstruction from ice data, and the active             role of snow and ice in climate processes.  The execution of the                Symposium on the campus of the University of Washington will be funded          through registration fees paid by participants and the International            Glaciological Society will publish proceedings as Volume 14 of the              Annals of Glaciology.  The cost of the publication will be                      covered, in part, by income from subscriptions.  This request is for            the remainder of the publication cost.",
