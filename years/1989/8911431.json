 "awd_abstract_narration": "The processes of discovery and creativity are topics of critical                importance for our understanding not only of how science works,                 but also for our understanding of how the human mind itself                     works.  While the processes of science are certainly unique in                  many respects, it has become clear that discovery and creativity                in science and art are in some sense related.  Dr. Lenoir is                    studying this interrelationship in the context of empiricist                    theories of vision in mid-19th century Germany and their relation               to the realist movement in painting.  One of the central issues                 facing the cultural and political life of German in the two                     decades following the failed revolutions of 1848 was the need to                construct a new vision of the future, one which rejected idealism               in politics, philosophy, and science in favor of the pursuit of                 practical interests.  This new orientation required the                         construction of a new kind of discourse of realism.  Dr. Lenoir's               concern is with the simultaneous pursuit of realism in theories                 of vision and in painting.  Central to his study is the work of                 Hermann Helmholtz in physiological optics and its relation to his               efforts to reformulate a Kantian epistemology with strong                       empiricist foundations. Arguing that Helmholtz treats the eye as                a measuring device, he places his work within a larger movement                 initiated in the 1850's to go \"back to Kant\" and construct more                 practically oriented foundations of knowledge. Equally important                for this study is the work of realist painters, particularly                    Adolph Menzel. The themes painted by realists were ideologically                charged.  Menzel depicted on canvas the image of German society                 united in terms of the pursuit of practical interests which also                inspired Helmholtz and other scientists such as Emil du Bois-                   Reymond, Carl Ludwig and Werner Siemens.  Dr. Lenoir's interests                go beyond the themes of realism to the techniques of realist                    representation.  For it is the theory of representation that                    links realism in painting to realist theories of vision and                     knowledge.  The work of the realist painters was a resource for                 Helmholtz.  Determining how painters succeed in creating the                    illusion of reality was one important source for determining the                rules and strategies the mind uses in constructing visual images.               The view of realist painters that a realist representation                      \"works\" not because it is a copy of reality but because it is a                 guide to practical action paralleled Helmholtz's sign theory, the               centerpiece of both his constructivist approach to visual                       perception and his empiricist epistemology.  The aim of this                    study is to show that painters and physiologists participated in                forming a common discourse through arriving at the same                         solutions to the problem of constructing realistic                              representations of the world.  Realism in painting and realism in               optics were simultaneous solutions in different domains for                     remaking the world.  Linked to one another through their related                concerns with vision, the common modes of representation gave                   rise to a structure of realistic discourse supported by language,               images and ways of knowing, the basis of a stable life-world.",
