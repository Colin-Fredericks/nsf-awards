 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to reach an understanding of                        planetary differentiation through igneous processes.  These                     processes include crust and core separation from the mantle                     through the generation of melts in a planetary interior,                        transport within the body (to the surface in some cases), and                   chemical differentiation.  Igneous rocks are seen as a  powerful                tool for probing the internal constitutions and thermal histories               of planets, or in the case of magmas differentiated near a                      planet's surface, as probes of the crust-forming process.                       Methods of study used include experimental petrology in the                     melting interval of planetary materials such as lunar samples,                  meteorites, terrestrial rocks, and synthetic compositions,                      petrographic and electron microprobe studies of experimental                    products and natural samples, as well as theoretical and                        numerical modelling of magmatic systems.  Equipment development                 and studies of high-pressure phase equilibrium, element                         partitioning, textural relations, and steady-state thermal                      disequilibrium are proposed.",
