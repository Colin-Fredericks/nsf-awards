 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of Dr. Douglas Wallace,               Brookhaven National Laboratory, in the Swedish Antarctic Expedition             scheduled for December 1988 and January 1989 in the Weddell Sea,                one of the world's greatest deep water formations.  During the                  expedition Dr. Wallace will make time series measurements of                    chlorofluoromethanes (CFMs). The collected data will then be                    interpreted in conjunction with physical and geochemical parameters             measured by Swedish co-investigators from the Department of Marine              and Analytical Chemistry, University of Goteborg, which is one of               the world's major centers of expertise on marine chemistry.                                                                                                     Chlorofluoromethanes can be used as transient tracers of ocean                  circulation and mixing over decadal timescales.  The proposed CFMs              study can make a significant contribution to the understanding of               oceanographic and geochemical processes in the Weddell Sea.  The                study of dissolved CFMs as time-dependent tracers in the ocean is               especially valuable in this region, where globally important deep               and bottom water types are formed.  Both the U.S. and Sweden will               clearly benefit from the proposed work.  The CFM data base                      previously collected by U.S. scientists will be expanded and the                Swedish expedition will be greatly strengthened by the addition of              CFM measurements to the shipboard program.",
