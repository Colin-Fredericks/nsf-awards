 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interactions between neurons in the formation of a synaptic                 contact are poorly understood.  When a potential target is                      contacted by an axonal growth cone, it initiates formation of a                 presynaptic terminal.  Dr. Burry will examine proteins that may                 be involved in the initiation and maintenance of this important                 cell.cell interaction.  The working hypothesis of the research                  project is that \u001adevelopmentally regulated proteins\u001a are up                     regulated during neuritic outgrowth, and that these proteins are                present at the growth cone.target contact.  The experiments to be               carried out will study the growth associated protein, GAP.43, and               two synaptic vesicle proteins, p65 and synapsin I, to determine                 if their subcellular distribution and their time of appearance is               consistent with classification as developmentally regulated                     proteins.  Immunocytochemistry will be performed with 10 um                     section examined in a confocal scanning laser microscope, with                  0.5 um frozen sections examined with epifluorescence, and silver                intensified 1 nm gold for the electron microscope.  One of the                  main reasons for the slow progress in the understanding of                      mechanisms involved in synaptogenesis has been the inability to                 identify developmentally regulated proteins.  The planned                       experiments will generate monoclonal antibodies to                              developmentally regulated proteins by combining the use of                      enriched antigen sources and newly developed immunization                       protocols.",
