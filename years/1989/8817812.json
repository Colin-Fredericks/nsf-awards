 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Amazon Deep-Sea Fan is a typical large modern deep-sea                 fan.  Past studies have shown the structure and surface                         morphology of the fan, including the location and character of                  the most recently active channel.  Cores collected in the                       vicinity of this channel sample the sediments deposited by                      channelized flows before activity cease following post-glacial                  sea level rise.  We need to determine dates on, and to                          correlate between, cores on the fan to relate sediment sequence                 to sea level and to each other.  We propose here (1) to develop                 a stratigraphy which will allow us to determine the age of                      sedimentary activity of the fan, (2) to use morphological and                   sedimentological data to determine the likely characteristics                   of latest Pleistocene channelized turbidity currents and (3) to                 integrate the age and sediment facies data with the morphologic                 and seismic data available on the fan.  The stratigraphy will                   be based on delta 0-18 curves supplemented with C-14 dates.                     Delta 0-18 can be measured on samples containing few                            foraminifera, an advantage in cores with high sedimentation                     rates.  C-14 dates on planktonic foraminifera and occasional                    wood fragments (using AMS techniques) and pollen analysis will                  constrain the chronostratigraphy.  Benchmark stratigraphies,                    developed in areas where downslope flows are minimal, will be                   carefully brought to areas where downslope flows are more                       common, and zones of downslope transport will be identified                     based  on structure and grain size characteristics.  The high-                  resolution 0-18 stratigraphy will also help us to assess the                    role of the Amazon River, the North Brazil Coastal Current and                  the Equatorial Countercurrent in determining late glacial/early                 interglacial paleoclimate.",
