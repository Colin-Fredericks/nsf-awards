 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present proposal seeks support to obtain a rebuilt Philips                  EM300 transmission electron microscope.                                                                                                                         Several major proposed projects require electron microscopy, but                are not adequately supported by existing equipment.  These                      research projects utilize combinations of morphological,                        morphometric and immunolocalization analyses in conjunction with                biochemical or molecular techniques.  (1) To study the influence                of calcium ions on differentiation in Physarum polycephalum.                    Exogenous calcium can induce differentiation and differentiation                is accompanied by mobilization of internal calcium stores.                      Morphometric analyses are proposed to quantitate changes in the                 mitochondrial content of stored calcium granules.   (2) To study                the genetic mechanisms regulating eggshell formation during                     oogenesis in Drosophila by visualizing the effects of well                      defined mutations on eggshell development and to localizing with                high resolution the responsible gene products.  (3) To study                    molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of the mitotic                      process to localizing with high resolution monoclonal antibodies                MPM-1 and MPM-2 which recognize a subset of phosphorylated                      proteins abundant in mitotic cells.  (4) To study calcium                       regulatory pathways in Trypanosoma brucei by immunolocalization.                (5) To use morphometric analyses to provide ultrastructural                     evidence of free radical damage during aging in tissues of the                  housefly, Musca domestica.  (6) To evaluate the basis of                        immunosuppression in mice infected with Trichonella                             pseudospiralis by analysis of adrenal mitochondria and lipid                    storage droplets in the zona fasciculate layer to provide further               evidence of a parasite induced hyperadrenal state.  (7) To                      evaluate, morphologically, the effect of mutations on ATPase                    organization.  (8) To identify changes in seminal vesicle                       composition and structure which accompany the aging process.                    Emphasis is place upon the distribution and quantity of type IV                 collagen, laminin, proteoglycans and testosterone.",
