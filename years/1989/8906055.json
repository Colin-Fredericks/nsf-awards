This                        involves an investigation of the natue of the binding site                      for cytochrome on the reaction center using site specific                       mutagenesis and the realtionship between reaction centers                       in bacteria and the ones in Photosystem II.                                                                                                                     Photosynthesis is the process used by plants and                                photosynthetic bacteria to convert sunlight into chemical                       energy.  This process involves light initiated electron                         transfer reactions which takes place in a protein complex                       called the reaction center which is a membrane bound                            bacteriochlorophyII-protein complex.  The reaction centers                      from photosynthetic bacteria have been extensively studied                      and well characterized by a variety of biophysical and                          structural techniques including X-ray crystallography which                     have opened up new areas of research.",
