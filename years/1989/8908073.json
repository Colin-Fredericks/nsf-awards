 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite an outpouring of work by historians (including economic                 historians) and others on the subject of the Great Depression,                  macroeconomists have written surprisingly little on it since                    Temin (1976) versus Friedman and Schwartz (1963) debate of some                 years ago.  During the hiatus,  the macroeconomic issues raised                 by the events of the 1930s (such as the real effects of stock                   market volatility,  bank failures,  domestic and international                  debt problems,  and protectionist pressures)  have become more                  rather than less pressing.  At the same time a stream of                        innovative research in macroeconomics has eroded the earlier                    mainstream consensus and reduced our confidence in received                     explanations of the Great Depression.                                                                                                                           This proposal requests funding for the first two years of a                     longer-term project to make a detailed and integrated analysis of               the interwar period (1919-1941).  The initial focus is on the                   development of a catalogue of sources of interwar data based on a               review of primary and secondary historical materials.  Attention                shifts next to the study of two sets of substantive questions.                  First,  what was the role of the apparent breakdown of the                      financial intermediation process in the initiation and                          propagation of the Depression ?  The sources of problems and                    responses to crisis both of financial intermediaries (banks,                    savings and loans)  and of private debtors,  will be considered,                using panel data wherever possible.  Second,  what were the                     determinants of aggregate supply during the interwar period ?                   Principal issues to be considered here include the persistence of               unemployment,  the role of the New Deal in the 1933-37 recovery,                and the somewhat anomalous behavior during this period of real                  wages and productivity.                                                                                                                                         This research should contribute significantly toward improving                  our understanding of the Great Depression era.  Equally                         important,  is the demonstration which it promises,  of the value               of this period as a \"laboratory\" for testing modern views about                 macroeconomic theory and policy.",
