 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Intertropical Convergence Zones (ITCZs) are                            climatological features in the earth's atmosphere that are                      intimately tied to both the tropical large-scale meridional                     (Hadley) circulation and the low-latitude surface circulation.                  The ITCZs drive the meridional circulation cells which transport                momentum and excess heat from the tropics to midlatitudes,                      thereby affecting the baroclinity of the midlatitudes and hence                 climate.  In addition, the eastern Pacific ITCZ appears to play a               role in the large El Nino/Southern Oscillation climate                          fluctuations.  Yet the dynamics and energetics of the processes                 maintaining the Intertropical Convergence Zones are poorly                      understood.  This study examines the maintenance of the ITCZ                    phenomenon and the associated large-scale circulation, using a                  General Circulation Model and a simplified 3-layer model of the                 tropical atmosphere.  The PI will explore how the surface                       boundary heating (sea surface temperature) and orography effect                 the location, strength, energetics and dynamics of the ITCZ                     through a carefully designed set of GCM experiments with                        increasingly complicated forcing.  A 3-layer model of the                       tropical atmosphere will be constructed and employed to                         facilitate in the interpretation of the GCM experiments (this                   model will explicitly resolve the boundary layer and the free                   baroclinic tropical tropospheric circulations).                                                                                                                      The results will help to better define the relationship                    between the ITCZ and large-scale meridional and surface                         circulations, and hence contribute to our knowledge of the                      global climate.",
