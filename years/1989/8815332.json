 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Martin Uman of the University of              Florida in a research collaboration with Dr. Francisco de la Rosa               of the Mexican Institute of Electrical Research in Cuernavaca,                  Mexico.  The investigators intend to pursue the development of a                procedure for estimating the lightning performance of unprotected               distribution lines, taking into account the effect of both direct               and close lightning.  Also, the investigators plan to implement an              evaluation program for determining the improvement of lightning                 performance by using different protection schemes.                                                                                                              Lightning is one of the major causes of damage to electric power                distribution systems.  Many studies have attempted to determine the             effects of direct strokes on both transmission and distribution                 power lines.  Recent work has demonstrated that, for the case of                distribution lines, even those strokes that terminate on ground in              the close vicinity of the line can produce a voltage whose peak                 amplitude is large enough to produce an insulation failure.                     Working independently, the two collaborators have obtained                      important results, such as the significance of the horizontal                   component of the electric field, which have markedly improved our               understanding of the mechanism of induced voltage generation.                   Using a specially constructed experimental facility near                        Cuernavaca, the two researchers now plan to join efforts to better              understand the effect of lightning strokes on power distribution                lines.",
