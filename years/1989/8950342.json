 "awd_abstract_narration": "Utilizing its thirty-plus professional chapters and eighty-plus                 university student chapters, the Society of Hispanic Professional               Engineers will expand its nine year old Advancing Careers in                    Engineering (ACE) program.   This program was developed to stimulate            interest among Hispanic pre-college students in engineering careers             and to provide continuing guidance on the educational preparation               needed for engineering study.  The Hispanic students in the university          chapters, with support from local members of the professional                   chapters, will plan and conduct a variety of promotional and                    informational activities for students from schools and communities              with predominantly Hispanic populations.  These activities will                 include classroom presentations and other activities in elementary and          secondary schools, field trips to museums and technical industries,             informational events for pre-college students and their families,               individual student mentoring and counseling, and science and                    engineering displays for community events.   Success will be measured           by following project-impacted students to find how many ultimately              enroll and succeed in university engineering studies.                                                                                                           Cost sharing by the partners will total 40% of the National Science             Foundation funding.",
