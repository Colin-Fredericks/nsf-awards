 "awd_abstract_narration": "CO2-H2O immiscibility to depths of > 30 km should be a                     direct result of the depression of isotherms that occurs during                 active transport of material down a subduction zone.  Fluid phase               separation in this environment should have a number of important                consequences for the thermal, mechanical, and metamorphic                       development of subduction zones, yet the effect documenting the                 extent to which fluid immiscibility controls petrologic processes               at high pressure.  Particular attention will be paid to                         determining whether small-scale interlaying of blueschist and                   greenschist and blueschist and eclogite assemblages results from                generation and preservation of fluid heterogeneities and whether                such heterogeneities could be caused by fluid phase separation.                 The approach taken will be (1) to use mineral phase equilibria to               calculate a (H20) and a (C02) ratios between adjacent layers both               within facies  types and across facies boundaries, (2) to                       determine fluid compositions directly from multiple generations                 of fluid inclusions, and (3) to model reaction pathways for rocks               in both the immiscible and supercritical fluid regimes. Samples                 to be studied are from coherent high-pressure terranes on the Ile               de Groix, in the Tauern Window, and on the island of Sifnos.  The               results should provide better constraints on the compositions of                fluids present at high pressure and result in better models for                 devolatilization of subducting slabs.",
