 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal funding to purchase an Argon laser and certain                 optical components is requested.  This equipment will be used to study          a technique for creating lateral modulation of the bandgap in GaAs              quantum well material.  One goal of this research is to generate                nanometer scale structures in two and three dimensions (so-called               quantum wire and quantum dot structures) that can be incorporated in            semiconductor laser active layers.  This method will also be useful in                                                                                          fabricating other optical components, such as waveguides on a similar           small scale.  In the technique an Argon laser is used to locally melt           the sample on a micron scale.  Crystal quality of the region is                 maintained.  In a more selective version of this technique we would             use a dye laser pumped by the Argon laser to \"resonantly\" melt the              quantum well.  By means of a nanometer scale masking techniques or              small scale intermixing of the well the principal investigator hopes            to observe phenomena associated with this increased lateral                     confinement of the electron gas.  Processing will occur inside a                scanning electron microscope already equipped with a                            cathodoluminescence system so that in stiu processing and diagnostic            tests can be run simultaneously.",
