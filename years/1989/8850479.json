 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a pilot project designed to stimulate greater student                   interest in history and science in the middle schools by                        introducing them to major developments in the history of                        science and technology in their social studies courses.  The                    project will focus on the world history course at grade seven                   and the United States history course at grade eight.                            Teachers from four school districts in northern California                      will take part in this project.  To  provide the teachers                       with the necessary knowledge about the history of science and                   technology, the project will organize summer institutes and                     school-year workshops.  To help them integrate this knowledge                   into the existing history courses, the project will develop                     and field test a teachers guide consisting of lesson plans                      for teaching about the history of science and technology.                       The four participating school district will provide teachers                    to help develop the teachers guide, participants for the                        institutes and workshops, classrooms for field testing the                      teachers guides, and will adopt the lessons on the history of                   science and technology as part of their regular curriculum.                     The teacher lesson plans and videotapes of teachers using the                   new lessons will be made available to other school districts.                                                                                                   The University of California at Berkeley is contributing in                     cost-sharing an amount that is equal to 25% of the NSF award.",
