 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award of supercomputer time.  The object is to design                and implement new algorithms which, by taking full advantage of                 parallel computing capabilities, will effectively solve large-                  scale, constrained, nonlinear global optimization problems on the               shared-memory CRAY 2, CRAY X-MP, and CRAY Y-MP supercomputers.                  Constrained global optimization problems arise in many important                areas of science and technology and include scheduling and                      allocation problems with nonconvex objective functions and a                    variety of computer-aided design and computational geometry                     applications.  These kinds of optimization problems may possess                 many constrained local optima, but an acceptable solution to the                problem requires that a global optimum, or a good approximation                 to it, be obtained.  Because of the inherent difficulty of                      computing the global optimum, the emphasis of this research will                be on the design and implementation of efficient algorithms which               obtain an approximate solution to these problems on parallel                    computers in a reasonable amount of time.  Typically these                      algorithms will find both an approximate solution and guaranteed                bounds on this solution, with the accuracy of the approximate                   solution and the tightness of the bounds depending on the amount                of computation performed.  In view of this approach, primary                    interest is placed on the average, rather than worst case,                      behavior of these algorithms, and the performance analysis of                   this behavior will require a combination of both theoretical                    investigation and extensive computational testing.",
