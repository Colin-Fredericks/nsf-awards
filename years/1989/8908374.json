 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colony dynamics and conflict between queens and workers over               the production of male brood are central issues in the study of                 social systems in the Hymenoptera (ants, wasps and bees).                       Success of workers (and of the queen) is heavily influenced by                  direct, worker reproduction.  If colonies in a social species                   typically include workers that are reproducing directly, it is of               great importance to be able to characterize those workers in both               morphological and behavioral terms in order to understand the                   proximate mechanisms controlling worker egg laying.  In order to                do this it is necessary to unambiguously identify laying workers                and also to clearly quantify the brood they produce.  A molecular               genetics technique, DNA \"fingerprinting\", can be used to obtain                 the necessary information.                                                           DNA \"fingerprints\" are individually specific patterns of DNA               fragments that can be used to determine which female is the                     mother of any of the offspring produced by a colony.  Comparison                of these distinctive yet heritable DNA patterns (\"fingerprints\")                among females and the offspring they jointly rear will be used to               determine precisely which females are the mothers of which                      offspring.  This information will be used in combination with                   behavioral and morphological data to investigate the proximate                  control of worker reproduction with the overall aim of                          understanding the evolution of social systems.",
