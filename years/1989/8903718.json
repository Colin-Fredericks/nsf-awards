One is the Center for Process                    Analytical Chemistry (CPAC) which is located at the University of               Washington (UW).  The other is the Center for Analog/Digital                    Applications Research (CADAR), a joint center which is located on               the campuses of Washington State University and University of                   Washington.                                                                          The evaluator will be responsible for implementation of the                NSF Center Assessment Program at each of the centers.  This is a                series of three related studies designed to identify the factors                that may contribute to and/or inhibit attainment of each center's               goals and outcomes.  Included among the three basic studies are:                a) developing comparative descriptions and conducting analyses of               each center's developmental history in the form of annual                       historical profile updates; b) conducting intermediate as well as               long-term studies of each center's organizational effectiveness                 using faculty and sponsor outcome assessment survey instruments,                and; c) conducting exit interviews of any industrial sponsor that               terminates their affiliation with either center.                                     The principal investigator is a recognized evaluator and                   eminently qualified to study the Industry/University Interaction                at the above two center.",
