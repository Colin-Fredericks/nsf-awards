 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current evolutionary research focuses on problems associated               with genetic changes that accompany the formation of new species                and the maintenance of the integrity of species in the face of                  hybridization with closely related species.  In order to                        understand processes involved in genetic differentiation, a                     pattern of evolutionary relationships must be constructed and the               traits under study must be viewed with reference to this pattern.               Evolutionary relationships have in the past proven difficult to                 construct for newly formed (very closely related) species but new               techniques are available which allow the collection of data from                the most variable DNA gene regions.  These techniques are used in               this research.                                                                       The insect species known as the periodical cicadas have                    proved to be ideal study organisms to address problems of                       evolutionary tree construction and species divergence; they are                 easy to work with and the six species have a unique set of                      distributional patterns within which are various degrees of                     spatial isolation, temporal isolation, and genetic variability.                 Results from previous work established higher level evolutionary                relationships, identified differences in genetic variability                    among species, discovered areas where hybridization is likely,                  and provided genetic evidence for life cycle plasticity which has               important implications for evolutionary theory.                                      The proposed research will examine suspected areas of                      hybridization among otherwise isolated groups and will extend                   phylogenetic analyses to the closely related, unstudied year                    classes which we suggest represent incipient species.  What is                  learned about the usefulness of particular gene regions for                     constructing evolutionary relationships will be directly                        applicable to the study of relationships among other animals and                plants and will lead to a better understanding of rates and                     mechanisms of evolution at the DNA level.",
