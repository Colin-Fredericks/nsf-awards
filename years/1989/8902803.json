 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in the                                 chemistry of carbon-bond seven-membered ring formation                          to be carried out by Rudolph Abramovitch of Clemson                             University and J.A.R. Rodriguez of the University of                            Campinas in Brazil.  A new method of formation of                               seven-membered rings, previously discovered by the                              collaborators, will be extended to the production of                            homo- and hetero-cyclic rings to determine the                                  structural and geometrical factors which favor ring                             formation.  Then, convenient routes to molecules                                related to naturally-occurring anticancer agents will                           be examined.  This will lead to the preparation of a                            variety of derivatives which retain useful biological                           activity but with reduced toxicity.  The objective is                           to develop mild, useful routes to desirable                                     biologically active compounds.                                                                                                                                  This work is a continuation of a productive                                     cooperation between the group at Campinas, a former                             member of which is now at Sao Paulo establishing a                              graduate program with eighteen research students, and                           Dr. Abramovitch's group at Clemson.  The Brazilian                              P.I. and a student have both spent time at Clemson                              which has helped in the establishment of a small                                research group at Campinas now working on                                       arylnitrenium ion chemistry.  This study will increase                          the knowledge of the formation, structure and                                   reactivity of arylnitrenium and -oxenium ions and bond                          formation in seven-membered rings which occur widely                            in nature and have been the target of much scientific                           and medicinal attention.",
