 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the week of September 11, 1988, Hurricane Gilbert struck the             Caribbean and Mexico.  Characterized as one of the most powerful                hurricanes ever recorded, with sustained wind speeds of 175 mph,                Gilbert caused enormous destruction.                                                                                                                            Two impacted communities will be the focal points of this study which           will address community-wide policy issues related to the                        reconstruction process following the Hurricane Gilbert disaster.  The           study will attempt to improve the knowledge base that can be used by            local, State, and Federal officials both before and following a                 disaster.  With findings from this study, public officials should be            better able to anticipate and respond to the range of policy issues             they may face.  This knowledge base can also be applied to various              kinds of natural disasters in various geographic locations.  So, for            example, given the potential for catastrophic consequences of                   earthquakes in the United States, and thus the need for knowledge               about reconstruction, research based on the Hurricane Gilbert recovery          could fulfill a significant national need.",
