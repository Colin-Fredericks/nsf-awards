 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our knowledge of the nature of prejudice can be deepened by examining           how jury decisionmaking is affected by ethnicity and by seeking to              understand the nature of any differential treatment.  This research             will investigate the influence of ethnic identity on the processing of          Anglo-American and Hispanic felony defendants.  Specifically, the study         examines the impact of jury composition on conviction and sentencing            patterns in felony cases adjudicated in Texas District Courts.                  Archival data will be analyzed using multivariate statistical                   techniques that will permit the examination of such factors as how the          social status and socioeconomic composition of juries influence their           dispositional decisions.  Notably, Texas is one of only a few states            that permit jury determination of guilt and sentencing in cases other           than capital trials.                                                                                                                                            Part of the importance of the research stems from the dearth of extant          data concerning the legal treatment of Hispanic defendants.  A more             important gap in our knowledge of differential justice that will be             filled is the consideration in this project of heretofore unexamined            aspects of the problem, such as the social status of jurors.  This is           the first research to examine this issue with respect to the                    dispositions of Hispanic defendants.  The project has the potential not         only to contribute to an understanding of the legal treatment of                Hispanic defendants, but also more broadly to the development of a              model of differential justice that considers the social characteristics         of legal decision makers in articulating the impact of law.",
