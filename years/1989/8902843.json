 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental and theoretical research project will obtain                  equilibrium and rate relationships for the thermal desorption of                adsorbed species from molecular sieves.  These relationships are                needed to establish a theoretical basis for predicting the dynamic              behavior of a novel separation process, \"Variable Temperature Stepwise          Desorption\" (VTSD).  The method permits separation of two or more               adsorbed components in a sequential fashion through a preferential              adsorption-desorption cycle.                                                                                                                                    Separations processes are the backbone of one of the most successful            major industries of the United States in the international                      marketplace.  Consequently, separations is one of the largest                   consumers of energy and a major contributor  to chemical manufacturing          costs.  Techniques like VTSD may make major contributions to chemical           industry efficiency in the coming decade.  One process very similar to          VTSD, Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), is already making major                  contributions to development of advanced separations technology for             the next century.  VTSD has the potential to make a comparable                  contribution, essentially serving to compliment PSA.  This project              will obtain experimental data necessary for developing and testing              mathematical models necessary for the further development of VTSD.",
