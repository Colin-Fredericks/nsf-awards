 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Ayusman Sen of The Pennsylvania State University                  from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry                   Program is for study of metal mediated electrophilic activation                 of carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bonds in hydrocarbons                      leading to the oxidative functionalization of alkanes and                       arenes. Especially important as a potential outcome of this                     research would be the catalytic oxidation of methane to                         methanol, an excellent and conveniently transportable energy                    source.                                                                                                                                                         The general approach will be to employ highly electrophilic,                    weakly ligated metal species such as the lanthanide(III) tri-                   fluoroacetate complexes in trifluoroacetic acid solvent. The                    study will address five major points: (a) the relationship                      between the propensity to cause electrophilic cleavage of C-H                   bonds and the nature of the metal, (b) the relative tendencies                  of the different classes of C-H bonds to undergo electrophilic                  cleavage, (c) the ability of different types of cooxidants to                   reoxidize the metal species in the catalytic cycle, (d) the                     possibility of using the metal solely as an electrophile and a                  separate two-electron oxidant to oxidize the metal-bound                        hydrocarbyl species, and (e) the possibility of achieving the                   electroplilic cleavage of C-C bonds.",
