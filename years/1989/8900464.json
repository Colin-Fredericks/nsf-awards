Based upon the                success of last years' program much enthusiasm has been expressed               by the faculty and by the students.  The 1989 program is aimed at               encouraging 8 students to participate in a \"player/coach\"                       relationship with faculty who are interested in neural networks                 and parallel computing.  Faculty contacts at other colleges will                be used to encourage women and underrepresented minorities to                   participate.  In addition to the research, other opportunities                  for professional and personal growth will be made available;                    these include \"overview\" seminars in other fields, informal                     lunches and talks with the math faculty, and social events.                     Students will be recruited from several of the 40 local colleges                who have underrepresented minority students.  Special efforts                   will be aimed at encouraging students from Historically Black                   Colleges and Universities to participate.",
