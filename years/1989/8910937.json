 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research activity is supported under the Research Opportunities            for Women - - Planning Grant Program.  This award will allow the                principal investigator to begin to assess how the political                     effectiveness of an interest group is related to the group's ability to         mobilize members.  The planning grant activity will explore the link            between individual member motives and group mobilization strategies.            The principal investigator will develop a plan for investigating the            kinds of mobilization strategies that interest group leaders pursue             and the conditions under which particular types of appeals are more             effective than others.                                                                                                                                          The investigator has a solid background for this type of research and           the issues to be addressed are both timely and important.  There is             good reason to believe that, consistent with the objectives of the              Research Opportunities for Women Program, this award may result in a            successful follow-up proposal.",
