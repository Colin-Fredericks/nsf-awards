 "awd_abstract_narration": "A direct measurement will be initiated for the Newtonian                   constant of gravitation, G, on a much larger distance scale than                previously achieved.  The method to be used is a precise                        measurement of changes in the local acceleration of gravity, g,                 at two locations in the vicinity of a large hydroelectric storage               pond.  A detailed study of the proposed site (the Ludington                     Pumped Storage Facility in Ludington, MI) and the proposed                      instrumentation (the portable absolute gravimeters developed at                 JILA) has shown that a measurement of G to a precision of 0.1%,                 on a distance scale of 10-100 m, is feasible.  The result would                 be directly sensitive to a proposed \"intermediate range force\",                 and could confirm or negate some published claims for its                       strength and range.  This project will involve undergraduate                    students in laboratory calculations and field measurements in a                 subject area which is both accessible to their understanding and                of immediate interest to the physics community.",
