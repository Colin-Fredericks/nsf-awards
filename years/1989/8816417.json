 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. William J. MacKnight and colleagues of the         University of Massachusetts to collaborate with Prof. Naoya Ogata and           co-workers of Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan, over a period of two             years.  They will prepare and study structural effects on conductivity          in new solvent-free,  ion-containing polymer complexes. Chemical                structure, polymer morphology and dynamics, and the state of the                incorporated salt species will be studied in order to obtain new                information about ionic conduction in this type of polymer.                                                                                                     The objective of this work is to enhance our understanding of                   conductivity in polymers, a phenomenon which finds important                    application currently in solid-electrolyte batteries and which may              even result eventually in polymeric semiconducting devices.  The                mechanism of conduction in solvent-free polymers is by ionic                    conduction, but little is now understood about why this process is as           efficient as it is.  In this work, the complementary expertise of               each group will be utilized: the Japanese scientists will synthesize            and characterize the ion-conducting polymers, and make electrical               measurements of the transport properties of the ions; the U.S.                  researchers will determine the supermolecular structures and other              properties of these materials, using a variety of physico-chemical-             techniques.",
