 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Natural Sciences Division at                   Pepperdine University to establish a Research Experiences for                   Undergraduates Site. The Site will enhance an already active                    program of undergraduate research in biology by teaching students               the common elements of the research process and increasing their                appreciation for the diversity of biological subdisciplines.  In                addition, the program provides a mechanism whereby students from                traditionally under-represented groups in science will have the                 opportunity to experience biological research.  The experience                  will begin with a research orientation workshop at the Catalina                 Marine Sciences Center during which students will be immersed in                the research process (literature review, hypothesis formulation,                and hypothesis testing) and introduced to the uses and                          limitations of specific research tools and techniques.  Holding                 the workshop in this remote location will insure that students                  are isolated from their normal routines, enabling them to devote                their full attention to learning the common elements of the                     research process.  After the orientation workshop, students will                pursue individual research projects under the direction of                      faculty in either ecology, cellular biochemistry, or                            neurobiology.  All research projects will be designed to provide                students with insight into how scientists formulated research                   questions, design experiments, collect and analyze data, and                    communicate their results to the scientific community.  Over the                course of the summer, visiting scientists will hold special                     research seminars in each research areas, giving students an                    opportunity to discuss their own data with other scientists.                    Each research group will hold weekly literature seminars to                     discuss current journal articles pertaining to their research                   interests.  The program will conclude with a student research                   symposium in early August.",
