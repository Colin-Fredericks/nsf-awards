 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a central laboratory for the study of                  nonlinear dynamics, chaos and fractals, and supports coursees in                mathematics, the physical sciences, and engineering.  Two                       mathematics courses -- one for students with no prior                           preparation, the other requiring acquaintance with calculus --                  use computers housed in the laboratory for simulation and                       graphical analysis.  The laboratory also provides hands-on                      experience for students with some background in physics in upper-               level classical mechanics and a special course solely devoted to                the study of nonlinear vibrations and oscillations in mechanical,               hydrodynamic, and elecrical systems.  The equipment in the                      laboratory will also be used for demonstrations of physical                     phenomena with students in the two mathematics courses.  The                    grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match                 for the NSF award.",
