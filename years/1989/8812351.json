 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accreted shallow-water carbonate terranes are a common feature                  of many ancient mountain belts, yet the tectonic history of the                 majority these terranes remains poorly understood. In many                      cases, this is because early deformational structures                           associated with initial accretion have been overprinted and                     obliterated by post-accretion structural and metamorphic events.                In order to fully understand the mechanism(s) of these shallow-                 water carbonate terranes, an active collision zone involving a                  shallow-water carbonate bank must be studied.  A detailed swath                 mapping and seismic reflection study of the active collision                    between the southeastern Bahamas and the island of Hispaniola                   will be used.  Here, the small, isolated banks of the Bahamas                   are colliding obliquely with the northern margin of Hispaniola,                 as part of the broad, transpressional North American-Caribbean                  Plate boundary.  The collisional setting of the southeast                       Bahamas contrasts markedly with the tectonically quiescent,                     passive-margin setting of the northwest Bahamas, providing an                   unparalleled opportunity to compare and contrast the                            development of shallow-water carbonate banks in widely                          differing tectonic regimes.  proposed use of the SeaMARC II                     seafloor mapping system, in conjunction with digitally recorded                 single-channel seismic reflection profiles, provides a system                   that is ideally suited for our proposed studies, which will                     focus on documenting shallow structures and surficial                           sedimentary features within the collision zone.                                 %%%                                                                                                                                                             Carbonate deposits in mountain belts are commonly associated                    with shallow marine sediments that have been thrust onto the                    continent during tectonic episodes.  This project will study                    carbonate sediments on the Hispaniola margin as a modern analog                 of the type of carbonate terrains that are found in                             tectonically active regions.  The sedimentology and structural                  setting will be examined using a combination of coring, seismic                 stratigraphy, and side-scan sonar imaging (SeaMarc II).  Results                may be used to interpret carbonate sediments in the many                        accreted terrains where such deposits are found.",
