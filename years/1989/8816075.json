 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Delbert True, Ms. Suzanne Griset will                conduct archaeological research which will contribute to the                    completion of her doctoral dissertation.  She will select a                     series of prehistoric ceramics which belong to the Luiseno and                  Diegueno pottery traditions of southern California and obtain                   dates from two laboratories.  One series will be sent to the                    University of Arizona TAMS radiocarbon dating laboratory which,                 through use of an accelerator technique, can produce absolute                   dates from very small amounts of organic material.  A sample from               the exterior wall of a sherd will be compared from addition                     samples taken from the interior and the fabric itself.  Other                   sherds will be dated at the University of Durham by                             thermoluminescence techniques to provide a check.                                                                                                               This research is important for two reasons.  First, it will shed                additional light on the prehistoric adaptations and cultural                    development of Californian native American tribes.  This area is                of special interest because these groups attained levels of                     cultural complexity which are extremely unusual among hunting and               gathering societies.  Archaeologists want to understand the                     subsistence and technological adaptations which made this                       possible.  The Luiseno and Diegueno traditions are particularly                 worthy of examination because preliminary information indicates                 that in both cases pottery was adopted at a surprisingly recent                 date.  However, the chronology of these traditions has not been                 well established and these additional dates are necessary.                                                                                                      Secondly, this research is important for its potential                          contribution to the techniques of ceramic dating.  Through this                 carefully designed selection of approaches and samples, it should               be possible to determine which techniques work best and why they                do so.  The results will be useful to archaeologists who work in                many parts of the world.                                                                                                                                        Finally, this project will contribute to the training and                       professional development of a highly competent young scientist.",
