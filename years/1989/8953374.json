 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Colorado Alliance for Science, a partnership of business                    & industry, schools, and colleges and  universities, will                       operate a collection of activities to bring the skill and                       knowledge of industry scientists, engineers, and other                          technically educated people into partnership with the                           expertise of teachers to improve science, mathematics, and                      technology education in numerous locations.  Administration                     of the program will be centered in Metropolitan State College                   in Denver, but project activities will be carried out in                        numerous school districts throughout the state, particularly                    those in rural or inner city locations.  Through the SUMMER                     FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM teachers will work on projects in industry                   which can produce publishable result and which may be                           suitable for recognition by college graduate credits.  In the                   VISITING SCIENTIST PROGRAM teachers and visiting scientists                     will be paired to form two-person teaching teams to bring                       industrial applications of science into the classroom of the                    teacher.                                                                                                                                                        The RETIRED EDUCATORS, SCIENTISTS, AND ENGINEERS TASK TEAM                      (RESETT) will recruit, train, and place technically                             knowledgeable retirees who as volunteers can help teachers.                     MANAGEMENT WORKSHOPS will bring industry people into school                     workshops and teachers and school administrators into                           industry workshops to promote cross-fertilization of                            management skills across the industry/education interface.                                                                                                      Cost sharing by the partners will total 199% of the National                    Science Foundation funding.",
