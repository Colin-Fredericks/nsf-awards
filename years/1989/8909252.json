 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support to investigate the current use of                intelligent systems to monitor the health of machinery and other                systems.  This support is in the form of a research assistantship               for a graduate student.  An intelligent system is one that is                   capable of making limited decisions based on the analysis of                    current information it is receiving and also perhaps based on                   historical data that it has access to.  In recent years there has               been a rapid growth in the research effort in the area of expert                and knowledge based systems, the latest component of this                       research being the design and use of neural networks.                                The principal investigator is doing research on monitoring                 the condition of valves in high pressure water pumps.  The aim of               the research is to identify parameters in vibration signals taken               on the pump that are sensitive to the valve conditions.                         Measurements are being taken regularly on several similar pumps                 at the plant and will be taken over a period of twelve to                       eighteen months.  These measurements will give a history of the                 vibration signals as the valves deteriorate and also allow                      comparison between similar pumps.  Within two years most of the                 pumps will need some kind of maintenance overhaul.  The types of                parameters that will be investigated will be signal power in                    particular frequency bands, signal statistics, and shape                        characteristics of the forcing signal at the valve seat,                        estimating using deconvolution techniques.                                           Having identified these parameters the next stage would be                 to build some portable device that could pick up the vibration                  signals from the pumps and rate the condition of the valves.                    This device could then be used by an unskilled operator to                      monitor the valve condition.",
