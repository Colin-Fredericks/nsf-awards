This project aims at                         preparation of a grammar and associated studies of Chiwere before               the language dies, taking with it much of the expression and                    tradition of the culture for which it had been the framing                      element.                                                                                                                                                             The study goals are (1) to write a grammar of Chiwere, based               on field work and archival materials; (2) to collect                            reminiscences and traditional narratives in Chiwere, as records                 of the past and as documents of the persistence of a culture; (3)               to offer counsel to interested Chiwere speakers and tribal                      groups, as requested, on the preparation of teaching and                        dictionary materials; (4) to provide direction to papers on                     specific topics in language, culture, ethnohistory, and                         prehistory; and finally (5) to train and direct the work of                     several graduate students toward increasing the number of                       scholars concerned with Siouan languages.  These goals will be                  achieved using standard structural linguistic field research                    methods, employing controlled elicitation of grammatical forms                  with careful transcription and analytic translation of a corpus                 of tape and video recorded texts.",
