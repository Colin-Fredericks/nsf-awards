 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on finding fundamental algorithms for synthesizing             analog integrated circuit layouts from schematics.  The algorithms use          sensitivity-driven, graph-based methods.  One set of algorithms uses            the sensitivity of the circuit's performance to resistive and                   capacitive layout parasitics, thermal gradients, and fabrication                process gradients to determine the relative positions of the circuit            elements.  Another set of algorithms generates the physical layout              using the sensitivity data.  These use a weighted constraint graphs             approach that has been utilized in IC layout compaction.  The graph             weights and constraints are determined from the sensitivity data.  An           appropriate solution of the graph then yields the analog circuit                layout.                                                                         Layouts for analog circuits are still hand crafted by experts familiar          with the circuit, system and manufacturing requirements.  About 10% of          application-specific designs, 50% of full custom designs and 80% of             printed circuit board designs contain analog circuits.  This research           addresses a fundamental need in analog design:  automation of the               layout of circuit elements, and the P.I. is addressing important                unsolved problems in this area.  The novelty is in using a sensitivity          analysis to determine relative placement of components on the chip.             The principal investigator is a promising and competent young professor         who should make significant contributions to the field.",
