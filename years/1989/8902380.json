They will study dynamical systems including                            the specific areas of homoclinic bifurcations,                                  rational mappings of the Riemann sphere, stability                              conjecture for maps of the interval and the dynamics                            and topology of the Lorentz attractor.                                                                                                                          In the last twenty or so years, significant progress                            has been made in this field with increasing impact on                           applications in biology, physics, chemistry and                                 economics.  This project will provide direct                                    cooperation between groups doing frontier research of                           fundamental importance to both countries.  It will                              also further strengthen the strong background of                                cooperation between two productive groups in the field                          of dynamical systems.",
