 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Andrew Myers is being given the Presidential Young                          Investigator Award from the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program                 to support his research into the development of new synthetic                   methodology for biologically active molecules.  This work will                  provide the information required to synthesize the new                          generation of molecules needed by agriculture and industry.                                                                                                     Techniques of chemical synthesis will be developed and applied                  to the preparation of molecules of biological importance.  In                   the latter category are designed molecules which are accessible                 only through total synthesis.  It is hoped that a deeper                        understanding of these bioactive substances and their mode of                   action will be gained through study of their properties, with                   emphasis on reactivity.                                                                                                                                         One such molecule under study is the antitumor antibiotic                       neocarzinostatin.  Ongoing investigations are aimed at                          elucidation of the precise mechanism of action of this                          DNA-damaging agent.  Synthetic studies towards the antibiotic                   as well as analog structures are currently underway.  One goal                  is to utilize the strategic concepts by which neocarzinostatin                  targets and destroys double stranded DNA in the design of                       completely non-natural mimics.                                                                                                                                  The highly enfolded and complex antitumor agent Calyculin A                     represents another target for study.  A fundamental goal of                     this undertaking is the development of reaction methodology of                  value not only for the synthesis of this antibiotic, but for                    the preparation of stereochemically complex molecules in                        general.  Again, it is anticipated that through the unique                      perspective of synthesis/reactivity that valuable insights into                 the mechanism of action of this substance will be gained.                                                                                                       In addition to the methodological studies encompassed by the                    projects described above, fundamental studies of greater                        applicability in synthesis are planned.  Transformations which                  represent powerful solutions to widespread and general                          synthetic problems, such as the preparation of geometrically                    defined carbon carbon double bonds, are targeted with the goal                  of devising new and useful solutions.",
