 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Expert System Workshop for Faculty Enhancement is providing six             hands-on workshops for engineering, science, and mathematics faculty in         the expert system applications area of artificial intelligence.  Each           of the six workshops lasts five days.  Each faculty member in                   attendance has the use of an enhanced IBM PC/AT for direct involvement          in the study of expert systems theory and applications.  The workshops          are addressing such topics as: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence          and Expert Systems, Structure of Programs including Inference Engines           and Knowledge Bases, Tools and Programs including LISP, PROLOG, PC              Plus, Shells, Analysis of Programming Concepts, including Frames,               Rules, Chaining and Parameters.                                                                                                                                 Expert systems and artificial intelligence are the leading edge areas           of fifth generation computing machines and knowledge of their nature            and uses can effectively be integrated into a faculty member's research         and teaching.  It is, furthermore, the case that expert systems and             artificial intelligence can be adapted to teaching and training of              students and is, therefore, a particularly appropriate area of inquiry          for engineering, science and mathematics faculty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \f     //",
