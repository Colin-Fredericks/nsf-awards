 "awd_abstract_narration": "A bacterial flagellum is driven at its base by a rotary motor               comprising a rod and set of rings embedded in the cell wall and                 cytoplasmic membrane.  The energy for rotation is supplied by an                electrochemical proton gradient.  The motor spins alternately clockwise         and counterclockwise, with a bias depending on sensory transduction, for        example, on the cell's response to chemical stimuli (chemotaxis).               Studies of the biochemistry and physiology of this system are being made        with Escherichia coli and a motile streptococcus. E. coli is being used,        because the structure of its motors can be perturbed genetically.               Streptococcus is being used, because its motors can be energized                artificially.  Measurements have been made, either with  swimming cells         or with cells tethered to glass by a flagellum, or  protonmotive force,         proton flux, torque and speed.  Paralyzed mutants have been repaired by         synthesis of wild-type protein encoded by genes carried on plasmids.            This work had led to a model for the motor consistent with existing             experimental data that is being subjected to further test.                          The goal is an understanding of flagellar rotation at the molecular         level, or more broadly, of how living things use chemical energy to do          mechanical work.",
