 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a two-semester laboratory sequence students are guided to               rediscover the basic principles of chemistry.  Instead of first                 learning theories in lecture and verifying the principles in the                laboratory, students make laboratory observations and cases each                student preforms experiments under slightly different conditions                and the class results are entered into a PC, graphed and                        displayed by the instructor.  Students participate as a group in                the discussion of the results and in some cases are able to                     return immediately to the laboratory and test the predictive                    power of their hypotheses.  Modern, rapid-scanning spectrometers                and chromatographs are a central feature of the discovery                       laboratory process.  These allow large numbers of students to                   discover concepts which are usually not considered in the general               chemistry laboratory.  In addition, certain classical general                   chemistry experiments are made more efficient through use of this               modern instrumentation thus making it possible for students to                  gather more data in a single period thereby maximizing the amount               of data available and still leaving time for group discussions of               the trends.  The institution is matching the NSF grant with an                  equal amount of funds.",
