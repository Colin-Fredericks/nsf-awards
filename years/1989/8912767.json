 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on system integration of VLSI functional modules           by creating uniformity in their interface behavior.  Such integration           is aimed at designing flexible, real-time, low-level vision systems             using pipelining of modules that correspond to individual operations.           Two tasks are addressed in this research.  First, functional modules            for benchmarking vision operations are designed and characterized.              Emphasis is placed on maintaining invariance in control and                     input/output requirements with respect to changes in the parameters of          each operation.  Second, algorithms and associated software for static          mapping of a given sequence of operations on a set of functional                modules connected through a network of switching nodes are developed.           These algorithms balance the workload of the modules in order to                achieve high throughput.  The characterization of individual VLSI               modules in terms of operation-specific input/output, buffer sizes, and          memory size allows more realistic prediction of system performance.                                                                                             Multiprocessor architectures for vision can be classified as                    homogeneous architectures and heterogeneous architectures.  In                  homogeneous architectures, exploiting parallelism optimally for the             diversified operations in vision is very difficult, while in                    heterogeneous architectures, only a small set of low-level operations,          relevant to the particular vision applications at hand, are                     implemented.  This research addresses the important problem of                  developing functional modules and their integration in order to                 dynamically tailor vision operations to the computer architecture at            run time.  Success in this research allows better exploitation of               parallelism for both low-level and high-level vision operations.",
