 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a novel method for processing polymer films to make gas                 separation membranes.  A polymer sheet is simultaneously                        stretched and compressed by pulling it through a roller                         (roll-truding).  The purpose of the prior work was to produce                   higher strength polymer sheets. However, the flux of gases                      through the resultant films has been round to be very high,                     approximately 1000 times what one would expect for the                          unprocessed films.  It is suggested this has occurred because                   there has been an alignment and segregation of microcrystalline                 domains within rubbery domains of the film, thus making the                     diffusion path through the film less tortuous.  Further, the                    domain size separating the crystalline domains is of angstrom                   dimensions, and can be controlled by the roll-truding process and               by subsequent annealing.                                                                                                                                        If still thinner films can be produced, domain sizes might be                   used in conjunction with differences in diffusion rates and                     solubilities to add a stearic selectivity to a gas separation                   process.  If the films can be used for gas separations, this will               constitute a major breakthrough in gas membrane separations, as a               very wide variety of polymers, which could not previously be used               for gas separations, can be turned into gas separation membranes                by this process.  Though it is probably not possible to produce                 hollow fiber membrane modules by roll-truding, the process should               be ideal for making spiral-wound modules.",
