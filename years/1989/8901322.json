 "awd_abstract_narration": "Issues regarding the design of complete, yet efficient, theorem proving         methods for first-order theories with equality will be studied.  Two            new proof techniques-proof orderings and transfinite semantic trees-            based on the paradigm of simplification orderings and used to establish         the completeness of a variety of theorem proving methods, including             refinements of resolution, paramodulation (without the functional               reflexivity axioms), and Knuth-Bendix type methods.  These meta-level           techniques form the basis for a rigorous treatment of rewrite-based             equational reasoning and of theorem proving strategies with deletion            rules such as simplification (demodulation), in general.                                                                                                        These techniques will be further refined and elaborated to apply them           to larger problem domains, and to build a programming environment for           quickly prototyping theorem provers.  This theorem proving environment          will provide facilities for effectively describing inference rules and          search plans, and observing and controlling the run-time environment of         provers.  It will include efficiently coded versions and primitive              operations such as unification, matching and reduction, as well as              different built-in abstract theorem-proving machines.  Two special              cases of abstract machines being studied are a reduction machine for            simplification and normalization, and a linear abstract machine for             stack-based strategies.",
