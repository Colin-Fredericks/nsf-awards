 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Drs. David C. Chapman,                   Department of Physical Oceanography, and Graham H. Giese,                       Department of Geology and Geophysics, Woods Hole                                Oceanographic Institution, to pursue with Mr. Rolu P.                           Encarnacion, National Institute of Atmospheric Sciences,                        Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services                   Administration (PAGASA), for a period of 24 months, a program                   of cooperative research to develop a predictive capacity for                    the occurrence of large-amplitude coastal seiches.  The                         collaborators will obtain time series measurements of                           sea-level oscillations and water temperature and salinity                       from Puerto Princesa Harbor, Palawan Island, Philippines, out                   to the shelf edge.  Data obtained from these measurements                       will be input into an improved numerical model, and the                         output will be compared with measured seiche characteristics.                                                                                                   Coastal seiches are long, standing waves that are frequently                    observed as water-level oscillations in harbors, bays, and                      over shelves with periods ranging from a few minutes to a few                   hours.  Even small vertical motions may be accompanied by                       relatively large horizontal motions, producing currents which                   can carry ships out of control and cause their  collision or                    grounding.  A simple two-layer model has been developed which                   relates seiche excitation by internal waves to the degree of                    stratification.  The output from this model will be compared                    with measured seiche characteristics.  The ultimate objective                   of this research is reliable predictions of Palawan Island                      seiches.  The collaborators are highly respected scientists                     in the field of this research.  The present project will                        allow them to combine their talents and interests for mutual                    benefit.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                     Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to                          increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and                   engineers and their counterparts in developing countries                        through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                          skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems                    of mutual benefit.",
