 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two most common features of stars are red dwarf                             characteristics and multiple formation.  The luminosity function                of stars is known to drop off substantially in the range below                  one-quarter solar mass.  In addition, the frequency of binary                   stars diminishes in this mass bracket.  Thus, data on the                       abundances, luminosities, and masses of these stars are difficult               to obtain, and not as plentiful or as accurate as desired.                                                                                                      The 61 centimeter refractor telescope at the observatory at                     Swarthmore College, under the directorship of Dr. Wulff Heintz,                 is devoted to the study of the distances of dwarf stars and                     binary stars and the determination of the orbits of binary stars.               These data result in more accurate estimates of the luminosities                and masses of these stars.  In the past Dr. Heintz has relied on                traditional instrumentation and techniques for these                            measurements.  With this grant, Dr. Heintz will begin the                       transition to modern methods and state of the art instruments,                  which should provide more reliable and more accurate data.  This                award is made under the auspices of the Research at Undergraduate               Institutions program at the National Science Foundation.",
