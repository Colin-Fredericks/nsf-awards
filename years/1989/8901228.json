 "awd_abstract_narration": "High-latitude environments impose constraints on breeding activities of         migratory birds which necessitate adjustments to a much shorter season.         Environmental constraints may have been met by adaptations of the               endocrine system which serve to fine-tune breeding activities to suit           arctic conditions.  It is proposed that the endocrine systems of polar          nesting birds display decreased sensitivity to stimuli that would result        in rapid and disruptive elevations of hormones which could affect               breeding or nesting activities at inappropriate times.  The roles of two        potentially antagonistic hormones will be examined:  testosterone, which        elicits territorial aggression; and corticosterone, which can act to            inhibit reproductive activities including territorial aggression.  The          endocrine adaptations to be investigated in this research program may           elucidate physiological mechanisms by which polar animals avoid delays          and/or conflicting behaviors which might reduce chances for successful          reproduction.",
