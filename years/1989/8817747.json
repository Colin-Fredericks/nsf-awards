 "awd_abstract_narration": "Procedures for sealing glass around metal conductors involve a great            deal of empiricism, and an accepted rate of rejection.  A                       manufacturing method is proposed which potentially speeds up the                process by an order of magnitude.  An experimental program will be              developed to investigate the details of the glass melting and cooling           cycle.  A CO2 laser will supply the heat uniformly distributed about a          glass cylinder through which one or two metal conductors pass.  A               finite difference model will be developed following the experimental            observations, with the proposed capability of predicting the seal               shape, internal stresses, and general integrity of the system as a              function of process variables.                                                                                                                                  A successful program will lead to a significant improvement in the              method of manufacturing glass/electrode seals, which in turn can                positively affect the productivity of this aspect of the electronics            industry.",
