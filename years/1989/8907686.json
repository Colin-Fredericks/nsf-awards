 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant hybrid zones are common and often represent natural                  experiments in which the genetically based defenses of plants                   have been mixed and are ideal for examining the ecological and                  evolutionary interactions of plants and herbivores as well as the               mechanisms of resistance.  This study will examine how the gall                 aphid, Pemphigus betae, selects hosts and responds to narrowleaf                cottonwood, Populus angustifolia, and natural hybrids with                      Fremont cottonwood, P. fremontii. Two interrelated sets of                      questions will be asked.  The first concerning the ecology,                     evolution and biogeography of this interaction will address  a.                 over many replicate river drainage systems are hybrid plants and                zones \"sinks\" for herbivores such that a few susceptible plants                 support most of the pest population?, b. if a clone (i.e. a tree                and its asexually derived progeny) is susceptible to aphids, will               it also be susceptible to other kinds of herbivores such as elk                 and woodboring beetles ?, and,  c. does the presence of                         extremely susceptible clones prevent herbivores from successfully               attacking resistant clones or do susceptible plants simply serve                as reservoirs from which they attack the rest of the population?                The second question, to address the mechanisms of resistance and                susceptibility asks , a. having sucessfully developed molecular                 genetic techniques (RFLPs) for this system, can the genes for                   resistance and/or susceptibility be marked and trees screened for               resistance in the pure and hybrid zones, b. since individual                    clones can be genetic mosaics (i.e., different parts of the same                tree are genetically different) what are the patterns of                        mosaicism between hybrid and pure host clones and how are they                  related to stressful growing conditions?, c. because individual                 clones can also be developmental mosaics of resistance (i.e.,                   different branches of the same tree or trunks of the same clone                 vary in resistance as a function of age), how do hybrids and pure               hosts vary in their developmental resistance? and, d. because                   physiological  sink-source relationships affect the resistance                  traits of individual clones, are they also important in affecting               patterns of developmental resistance within individual clones.",
