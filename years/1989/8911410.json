 "awd_abstract_narration": "The numerical solution of transient problems is central to                 the solution of many scientific and engineering problems.  Often                the differing time scales make it necessary to solve very large                 systems of mildly nonlinear equations, which is possible only                   with methods derived from iterative linear equation solvers.  The               objective of this research is the application of new iterative                  method techniques to transient problems, stressing the                          implementation on parallel computers.  Two approaches are                       considered here, one to solve a set of implicit difference                      equations that are usually nonlinear, and the other to develop                  methods of the waveform type, which is iteration applied to a                   functional formulation of the transient problem.  The methods to                be employed consist of the analysis and algorithms developed for                both initial value problems and for the iterative solution of                   linear algebraic equations.  Large scale problems are of                        particular interest, and require, especially for 3D simulations,                iterative methods on new processors.  This work emphasizes the                  use of currently developed software technology for immediate use                in the scientific and engineering communities.  The significance                will be to improve efficiency of algorithms for solving large                   scale transient problems on vector and parallel processors.",
