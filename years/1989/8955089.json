 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project comprises a series of four planning meetings                  - 3 focus group sessions and a final conference - designed to                   inform the planning of science curriculum reform. It brings                     together individuals from diverse disciplines and perspectives                  - vis. science, mathematics, cognitive science, curriculum                      theory and development, organization theory, policy analysis                    and practice - to discuss, in depth, aspects of the interaction                 of school organization, science teaching and learning, and                      policy. This year-long effort of conceptualization and planning                 will result in two substantive products. One will be an issue                   paper submitted to the Directorate for Science and Engineering                  Education that will provide information to the Foundation about                 the development and support of curricular reform initiatives in                 science. The second will be a paper developed for school                        practitioners and reformers. It will integrate the best                         knowledge and practice in areas of science education, teaching,                 curriculum reform, and planned change to offer advice to                        educators pursuing new models of science education.                                  The project is being led by a diverse group of core                        participants: Milbrey McLaughlin, Leon Henken, Jerome Pine, Lee                 Shulman, James Greeno, and Penelope Eckert. They will be                        convened in the summer of the planning effort and will engage                   other experts from similar backgrounds - but from a variety of                  different settings and experiences - in each of the focus group                 sessions. The iterative planning effort will generate a rich                    understanding of the current status in re research, practice,                   and organization policy and change vis. research, planning and                  implementation of science curricular reform initiatives in                      school settings.                                                                     The cost sharing by Stanford University amounts to 21% of                  the amount requested of the Foundation.",
