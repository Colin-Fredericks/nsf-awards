 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Azores, the squid (cephalopod) Loligo forbesi is large                   enough to carry smaller versions of the transmitters that have                  been used on pelagic fish such as swordfish.  The technique can                 be applied to squid in their natural habitat with a minimum of                  effort spent for development of new instrumentation.  The squid                 will be followed in course and depth for a period of several                    days.  Diel vertical migrations, associations with the bottom                   and with sound scattering layers, and response to the                           thermocline will be investigated.  A program of controlled                      experiments on squid held in tanks will allow evaluation of                     effects of the implanted transmitters on survival and behavior,                 and will provide opportunities to extend a series of                            measurements of intra-mantle pressure and respiration to a                      squid that is an order of magnitude larger than those                           previously studied.  The investigation will probe the limits of                 the application of telemetric techniques to studies of this                     poorly understood, difficult to sample, biologically and                        economically important group of nektonic animals.                               %%%                                                                             Squid in the vicinity of the Azores are an economically                         important resource and are large enough to be tagged with                       acoustic telemeter devices.  The daily behavior of Loligo                       forbesi can be used to understand how the animal finds enough                   food to support its high respiration and growth rates.                          Experiments with squid kept in tanks in the Azores will show                    the extent to which the tag and tagging process cause                           mortality, and the variability in respiration rate and intra-                   mantle pressure of this mobile nektonic predator.",
