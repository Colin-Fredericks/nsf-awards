The starting point for this research is                  the work of Varadhan and Donsker, in the setting of Euclidean                   space.  Start with a Poisson distribution of spheres of fixed                   radius, and consider a large sphere of radius N.  Let D be the                  Laplace operator.  With Dirichlet boundary conditions on both                   the large sphere and the smaller ones, there is a probability                   distribution of eigenvalues (appropriately normalized) of -D in                 the large sphere.  As N increases, the random measures converge                 to a deterministic measure.  One question then involves the                     limiting behavior of this measure on the interval (0,v) as v                    converges to 0.  The investigator has extended known results in                 Euclidean space to hyperbolic spaces.  Proofs in both types of                  spaces involve probability arguments and heuristics.  The                       Investigator Intends to extend these results into other less                    restrictive spaces, where for example, the invariance properties                of the underlying process would no longer be available.",
