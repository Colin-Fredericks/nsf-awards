 "awd_abstract_narration": "Resource quality is a major factor controlling rates of                    organic matter decomposition and nutrient release in forested                   ecosystems.  Within the constraints of resource quality and                     microclimate, decomposition and nutrient dynamics are the product               of faunal-microbial interactions.  Activities of microarthropods                generally increase decomposition rates of leaf litter and, data                 suggest, enhance immobilization of exogenous nitrogen.                               The objectives of this project are to examine the effects of               resource quality on the decomposer community and on forest floor                N fluxes, using 15N as a tracer, and to examine in more detail                  the effects of microarthropod activities on nitrogen movement.                  Field experiments will examine the influence of resource quality                on (1) net mineralization of N from 15N-labeled litter                          substrates, (2) the movement of released 15N through the forest                 floor profile (litter N, F-layer N, soil active (microbial) N,                  soil slow/passive N, and soil extractable N); (3) immobilization                of 15N-labeled exogenous inputs and subsequent mineralization and               movement, and (4) fungal translocation of N from the soil horizon               to surface litter using 15N as a tracer.                                             In research now nearing completion, exclusion of                           microarthropods from decaying substrates has produced a                         significant effect on decomposition rates and N retention.  The                 mechanisms for this effect will be examined in detail under more                controlled conditions, by directly manipulating microarthropods                 in laboratory incubations, and by measuring the quantitative                    effects of microarthropod-microbial interactions on: (1)                        microbial standing stocks and total heterotrophic respiration,                  (2) mineralization of N from 15N-labeled litter and (3)                         immobilization of 15N-labeled exogenous inputs.                                      This research group has demonstrated consistent excellence                 and productivity.  Institutional accommodations are first-rate.                 Products of this research should be of importance to the better                 management of forest resources as well as to the fundamental                    understanding of forested ecosystems.",
