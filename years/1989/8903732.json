 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continental back-arcs and within-plate basaltic volcanic                        provinces provide a view into the evolution of the mantle and                   lower crust beneath continents and the mass flux of materials                   that are subducted, but not extracted by arc volcanism.  One of                 the largest of these continental basaltic provinces is the                      Patagonian basalt field in southern South America which extends                 discontinuously for 1800 km. east of the Andes and in places                    almost reaches the Atlantic coast.  Basaltic volcanism ranges                   continuously in age from late Paleocene to Recent with activity                 concentrated in different places at different times.  The                       geographical distribution of the basalts, their spectrum of ages,               and their variable basement make the Patagonian plateau an                      excellent place to examine the cause and effect of varying                      tectonic conditions on the evolution of the basalts and more                    indirectly, the crust and mantle.  An understanding of the source               region of both arc and back-arc rocks is dependant on                           understanding which components change due to variable tectonic                  conditions and which are the result of long term mantle and                     crustal heterogeneities.  This project is to examine temporal                   geochemical variation (using major and trace element chemistry;                 Nd, Sr and Pb isotopes; and some mineral chemistry) in two                      regions of the plateau.  It complements the detailed studies                    being done in the Andean arc and the more limited studies of the                late-Pliocene to Recent evolution of the plateau.  ***//",
