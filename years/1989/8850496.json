The project will provide a series of three-day              workshops with one-day follow-ups locally at school systems throughout          the Southeast. Precollege and university resources available from within        SECME will be utilized to enhance the skills of less expert teachers.           SECME Institutes had previously readied teachers for participation in           the program and this new project will provide advanced inservice of             subject-matter science related training.                                                                                                                        An amount equivalent to 6.2 percent of the NSF award is being                   contributed by SECME as cost-sharing.",
