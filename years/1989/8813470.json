 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peter Felker is supported by a grant from The                            Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform structural                   studies on large van der Waals complexes using newly developed                  picosecond laser spectroscopic techniques.  These new                           techniques which are referred to as rotational coherence                        spectroscopy (RCS) and Fourier transform stimulated emission                    pumping spectroscopy (FT-SEPS) provide important information                    about the structure and ground state potential energy surfaces                  for this very interesting class of molecules.                                                                                                                      RCS is a picosecond time-domain method based on the                          rotational quantum beat phenomenon, and it will be used to                      measure excited state rotational constants of large van der                     Waals complexes, hydrogen-bonded complexes, and species with                    torsional degrees of freedom.  The goal of these experiments is                 to obtain information pertaining to the geometries of important                 species that are difficult to study with other high resolution                  techniques.  FT-SEPS, an interferometric version of stimulated                  emission pumping spectroscopy, will be applied to high                          resolution studies of the ground-state rovibrational level                      structures of similar species.  Here, again, the elucidation of                 geometries via the determination of (ground-state) rotational                   constants is the primary goal of the experiment.  A secondary                   goal is to obtain information about inter- and intra-molecular                  potential energy srufaces via high resolution vibrational                       spectroscopy.",
