 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports collaborative research                      by Dr. V. Rajamani, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) New                       Delhi, India and Dr. G. Hanson, SUNY, Stony Brook, NY.  The                     research continues work done previously on the Kolar Schist                     Belt, and begins studies of the Ramagiri and Kadiri Schist                      Belts to the north of the Kolar Schist Belt.  Previous                          studies suggest that the Kolar Schist Belt is a suture which                    separates two Archean gneiss terranes with different                            geologic histories.  Also within the belt the amphibolites                      from the eastern and western sides have different isotopic                      and incompatible element characteristics suggesting their                       development from independent sources.  The proposed studies                     will attempt to study the adjacent belts to learn of the                        tectonic processes leading to the present composition and                       formation of these belts.  The area is known to have mineral                    deposits of ecomonic significance.                                                                                                                              Scope:  The two teams from JNU and SUNY Stony Brook have                        collaborated for several years under previous NSF grants                        with considerable success and with significant resulting                        publications.  That work has also formed the research                           dissertations for several Ph. D. students at both                               institutions.  It is highly likely this project will                            continue this strong, productive cooperation.                                                                                                                   Funding:  This project is being funded under two grants:                                                                                                        1.
