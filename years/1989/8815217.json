 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued collaborative research on the                 topic of industrial productivity between Dr. Zvi Griliches, Harvard             University and Dr. Jacques Mairesse, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en                 Sciences Sociales (EHESS) and Ecole Nationale de la Statistique et              de l'Administration Economique (ENSAE), Paris, France.  The                     National Bureau of Economic Research, under the direction of Dr.                Griliches, has been conducting a major study in this area for the               last several years with support from NSF.                                                                                                                       Joint research to date between Dr. Griliches and Dr. Mairesse has               concentrated on two major topics:  comparative studies of                       productivity growth and econometric issues in the analysis of panel             data.  They will now expand into a third area:  the measurement of              output and prices at the firm and industry level as a prerequisite              for the correct understanding of movements in productivity.  In the             first area they have been studying the impact of R&D expenditures               on productivity growth of firms in the U.S., France, and Japan, and             also comparing the patterns of growth of firms in both France and               the U.S.  This has resulted in a major study comparing productivity             growth and returns to R&D in Japanese and U.S. manufacturing and                two parallel studies of individual firm growth in the U.S. and                  France respectively.  The present award will allow the                          investigators to expand and update their Japanese manufacturing                 study using newer and more extensive data.  They also plan to                   extend the earlier U.S.-Japan comparison to include a direct                    comparison to similar results for French firms.  Additional topics              of study will be 1) measurement of output and prices 2) analysis of             patent data using European data on their renewal rates to infer                 both the rates of obsolescence in the private value of patented                 knowledge, and the magnitude and distribution of such values.  Both             Dr. Griliches and Dr. Mairesse are highly regarded experts in this              area of economics research.",
