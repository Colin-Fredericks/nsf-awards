These quadrennial Congresses                 bring together historians, scientists and engineers from around                 the world to discuss the latest research results and                            opportunities, to debate new methodologies, and exchange of                     ideas with peers whose work one has only read about in the                      professional literature.  While research in all areas of the                    history of science, technology and medicine will be presented,                  the special theme of this Congress is \"Science and the Political                Order.\"  By this, the organizers mean research on all aspects of                the historical relationships between science (including                         technology and medicine) and the manifestations of secular and                  nonsecular power in all of its various forms -- political,                      ecclesiastical and juridical.  The Congress will consist of                     invited lectures, plenary sessions, symposia, contributed papers                and poster sessions.  American researchers have long set the                    standard for work in the history of science and technology.  It                 is important they be given the chance to present their work for                 international scrutiny as well as for them to learn what is going               on at the forefront of the discipline in other countries.  These                Congresses are uniquely suited for this kind of interchange and                 this one in West Germany promises to be especially valuable in                  this regard.",
