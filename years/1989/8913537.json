 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mixed convection in a pipe or an annulus aligned with the                       direction of acceleration (vertical direction under normal                      gravity) is unstable.  The flow pattern and transition differ                   significantly from those for an isothermal flow.  Experimental                  evidence indicates that the pipe flow is supercritically                        unstable for an aiding mixed convection while it is                             unconditionally stable to infinitesimal disturbances for an                     isothermal flow.  This problem has received very little                         attention in spite of its practical importance.  A three-year                   project is proposed to study this phenomenon analytically and                   numerically.                                                                                                                                                    Convection driven by the acceleration due to gravity in the                     presence of a temperature difference can be an effective and                    useful mechanism to transfer heat if the appropriate scales                     for length and time are not too small.  This is particularly                    true in rapidly rotating machinery, in which the centrifugal                    acceleration can be 105 times larger than the gravity                           acceleration; consequently, the buoyancy effect due to density                  stratification must be considered.",
