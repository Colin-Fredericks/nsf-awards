 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general goals of the research of Dr. Janet Leonard have                been identifying and understanding the mechanisms by which                      animals, particularly invertebrates, are able to use behavior to                respond adaptively to their environment.  In order to understand                how a particular behavioral strategy has evolved one must: 1)                   describe the behavior in detail; 2) analyze the selective                       pressures that may influence the behavior; and 3) describe the                  mechanisms that produce the behavior in order to understand how                 the behavior is inherited.  In order to do this, Dr. Leonard uses               a combination of the ethological, physiological and ecological                  approaches to the study of behavior.  At present, working with                  freely-moving animals, Dr. Leonard is developing a model system                 for the neuroethological analysis of the physiological mechanisms               responsible for the association of functionally-related behavior                patterns in time and the mechanisms by which one set of behaviors               is succeeded by another.  This work is important because it give                us a better understanding of how the nervous system governs                     spontaneous changes in behavioral activity.",
