The goal of the summer school is to provide graduate students                   and postdoctoral fellows with an introduction to the study of                   \"complex\" behavior in mathematical, physical, and living                        systems.                                                                             The emphasis of the school will be on developing                           techniques for measuring and analyzing complex behavior, and                    applying these techniques to the study of specific systems.                     Subjects to be covered include nonlinear dynamics,                              computational and algorithmic complexity, disordered systems,                   neural nets and computational neurobiology, chemical                            oscillators, lattice gases, pattern formulation in biological                   systems, and design of parallel-processing algorithms.                               The four-week school will consist of approximately nine                    short courses together with seminars, computer workshops, and                   experimental labs supplementing the lectures.  The first three                  weeks will be organized around formal lectures, and the final                   \"Research Week\" will be devoted primarily to research on                        projects suggested by the lecturers.  The material presented at                 the school is intended to be accessible to advanced students                    with graduate-level training in the mathematical, physical,                     biological, or information sciences and a strong mathematical                   background.",
