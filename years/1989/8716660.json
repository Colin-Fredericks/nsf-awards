 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of backarc basins has been a topic of much                      interest and some controversy to marine geologists, geophysicists               and petrologists for several decades. This interest stems in part               because of their location close to island arcs where different                  magma types are erupted synchronously with formation of the                     backarc basin crust. The thermal and stress regimes of backarc                  basins are of interest because they represent extensional                       tectonics, steep thermal gradients and mantle upwelling and                     melting in regions which are dominated overall by compression and               subduction of old and cold sediments and crustal rocks to                       considerable depth within the mantle.                                                The present award will support a geologic and geochemical                  study of the formation of the Lau Basin which lies to the west of               the Tonga Trench and Tonga Ridge in the southwest Pacific. The                  Lau Basin began rifting within the last few million years and has               shown a progressive change in basalt chemistry from a dominance                 of island arc related basalts to more normal backarc basin                      basalts. Such a change implies an evolution in the mantle source                region from which the basalts are erupted. The field program will               examine both the transition regions where mixed basalts have been               erupted and the spreading ridge where normal basin crust is                     presently being emplaced. Subsequent laboratory analyses of                     recovered samples should fully define the backarc melting regime                and allow a comparison of the Lau Basin with the more fully                     studied Marianas back arc basin. Data from the field program will               also aid in defining potential sites for ocean drilling.",
