 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central problem in ecology is to explain how the great                   numbers of rare tree species found in tropical rainforests are                  maintained through time.  Approximately 70% of these species                    occur at a density of less than 2 trees per hectare.  Long-term                 studies of species rarity and forest dynamics using a unique set                of three contrasting dipterocarp forests from northwest Borneo                  have been censused since 1965.  Hypotheses which explain the                    maintenance of rare species are being tested using these data                   combined with sapling and seedling surveys from 1986 to 1988 and                detailed forest maps.  One forest is subject to periodic                        catastrophic drought during which canopy trees die while a second               forest is heterogeneous in space due to local landslips.  Species               richness is greatest in forest which is intermediate in soil                    fertility and levels of disturbance.  Because of these                          differences among forests, there may not be one simple                          explanation for the great species richness of these forests.                    These data are being analyzed jointly with members of the                       Malaysian Forest Department concerned with practical matters of                 forest management.  The results are also relevant to conservation               biologists concerned with the maintenance of biological                         diversity.",
