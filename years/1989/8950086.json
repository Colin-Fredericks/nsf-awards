 "awd_abstract_narration": "A group of college faculty is meeting together for a three week                 intensive workshop in which they are exploring matrix theory as                 it is applied to a variety of topics.  The mornings are being                   devoted to lectures by the main speakers and the afternoons to                  group discussions, problem solving periods, participant talks,                  classroom ramifications and the use of computer facilities in                   support of the topic.  The workshop content is in the general                   area of modern applied algebra, focussing primarily, but not                    entirely, upon ideas from matrix theory and combinatorial                       methods.  Many of the ideas are useful concepts from advanced                   matrix theory, not often found in any course, or very seldom                    combined together in a unified course.  The faculty participants                will be requested to submit a report indicating how these ideas                 were incorporated into, or affected, the courses and/or research                during the 1989-90 academic year.  A follow-up session reporting                on the results will be held at the national MAA/AMS meeting in                  1990.                                                                                                                                                           The project is also being supported by the Division of                          Mathematical Sciences.  In addition the faculty participants in                 the project are receiving support from their home institutions.",
