 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish a Research Experiences for                    Undergraduates Site administered through the Biology Program at                 Oregon State University.  The program will provide undergraduates               in biological sciences with research experiences in ecosystem                   studies at the Andrews Experimental Forest which is the site for                several interdisciplinary projects, including the NSF sponsored                 Long-Term Ecological Research Program.  Students will learn and                 develop skills as they interact and work closely with scientists                from several disciplines on individual projects within the larger               coordinated studies.                                                                    To foster student development, a 4-phase program is planned:            an overview phase which explains integrated ecosystem studies, an               apprenticeship phase to develop skills, a personal research                     phase, and an evaluation and follow-up phase.  According to their               interests, students will join a collaborating scientist for the                 second and third phases.  The Principal Investigator will                       coordinate the program, organize the overview phase, field trips,               and seminars, integrating the students and collaborating                        scientists, facilities progress toward independent questioning,                 and evaluating results.                                                                 Students will be housed at the field station with other                 researchers, an arrangement that encourages after-hours                         discussions and helps break the barriers between disciplines.                   The project will place promising students at a scenic research                  site with an interdisciplinary team of scientists to produce good               science and develop an enthusiasm for biological research.",
