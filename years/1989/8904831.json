 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Epitransitional\" geomagnetic fields (i.e, those which                     immediately precede or follow polarity reversals) probably                      reflect changes in normally stable core processes.  They are                    therefore more likely to exhibit repeatable behavior than the                   fields resulting from the less stable, more disorderly processes                predominant during the midpoints of reversals.  Distinctive                     epitransitional field behavior is apparent in the Steens Mountain               transition zone, which shows 1) field dispersion being high                     before the reversals and normal afterwards and 2) field intensity               steady before the reversal and oscillating afterwards.  Work                    supported by the Research Corporation shows that the dispersion                 of field directions follows exactly the same pattern before and                 after an R-N reversal recorded in basaltic flows on Kauai,                      Hawaii.  The key question is whether the behavior of field                      intensity is also repeated.  Construction of an apparatus for                   paleointensity experiments (funded by a RUI Research                            Instrumentation grant) has exhausted summer salary support from                 the Research Corporation grant.  This award provides support for                the paleointensity experiments and thus allow completion of the                 Kauai project.  Undergraduate students will continue to be                      involved in every aspect of the study.",
