 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to advance the technology of high-precision                grinding of glass, known as \"ductile regime grinding\", with the                 specific aim of eliminating surface fracture and subsurface                     damage.  With this new technology, many materials that have                     previously been difficult to machine to accurate shapes because                 of their brittleness can now be machined to mirror finishes in a                single grinding operation.  This improved material-removal                      process is made possible by controlling the grinding infeed to                  rates below 100 nanometers per grinding wheel revolution.  This                 process adapts the ductile-regime, and even the new technology                  described above cannot completely eliminate surface fracture                    during the grinding of glass.  It is proposed that by introducing               a diamond polishing slurry between the grinding wheel and the                   workpiece, high precision optical-quality glass components could                be produced for the first time with a single machining operation.               An additional benefit resulting from the introduction of a                      polishing slurry into the grinding zone is that it will permit                  ultra-precision grinding of large (greater than 1 meter) optical                components, an application that has previously been considered to               be impossible because of the rapid dulling of the diamond                       grinding wheel in the machining of glass.  In this application,                 the combined grinding/polishing approach has considerable merit:                by continually dressing the wheel, the loose abrasive solves the                problem of grinding wheel dulling.  At the same time, the precise               control of tool position offered by grinding overcomes the                      inherent contour inaccuracies that are encountered in polishing                 operations.",
