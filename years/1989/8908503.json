 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines the effects of marital disruption on the                    well-being of children.  Unlike most previous studies, the                      principal investigators conceptualize the process of                            disruption as beginning well before the parents actually                        separate and as taking on diverse forms after separation.                       They will draw on three large-scale, longitudinal studies to                    examine the effects of the divorce process on children's well                   being.  In each study, the subjects to be analyzed will be                      those children who were in nondisrupted families at the time                    of the first child assessment.  The well-being at later                         assessments of children whose families subsequently disrupted                   will then be compared to the well-being of children whose                       families remained intact.  Within the disrupted group,                          variations in the post-disruption process (such as contact                      between the noncustodial parent and the child, or the                           remarriage of the custodial parent) will be examined.  Of                       special note is that all analyses will include indicators                       that control for observed differences in well-being that                        already existed at the first (predisruption) assessment.                        This study will make an important contribution to our                           understanding of how family processes affect the lives of                       children.",
