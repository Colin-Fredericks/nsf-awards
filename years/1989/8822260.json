 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in earth crust                         deformation.  The work will be performed by Steven N. Ward of                   the University of California, Santa Cruz and Sergio Barrientos                  of the University of Chile in Santiago.  They propose to study                  the coseismic displacement field of the 1960 earthquake in                      southern Chile and the postseismic crustal deformation of that                  event and the 1985 earthquake in Central Chile.  Geodetic                       elevation changes, triangulation measurements and tide gauge                    observations will be used to indicate the location and intensity                of coseismic slip and interseismic creep in great detail.                                                                                                       There is important geodetic and seismic data available for                      Chile.  The U.S. training and Chilean contacts of Barrientos                    will facilitate the utilization of these datasets and the                       collection of new measurements.  This is an excellent                           opportunity for mutually beneficial scientific cooperation                      between U.S. and Chilean scientists.  The Chileans will be able                 to use the advanced techniques of the U.S. scientists to handle                 this data and the U.S. scientists will learn the details of                     stress accumulation during the earthquake cycle.  This award                    will help maintain a useful and productive international                        scientific relationship and thus further the goals of the                       Science in Developing Countries program.",
