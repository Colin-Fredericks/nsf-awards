 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will attempt to relate the rate or extent of surface-              induced conformational changes in adsorbed proteins to their                    equilibrium adsorbed mass by in situ ellipsometry.  Equilibrium                 isotherms of alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, and kappa-casein            on germanium will be evaluated.  Then, the influence of time on                 conformational changes experienced by these proteins will be                    quantified by continuously monitoring the film thickness by                     ellipsometry.                                                                                                                                                   It is now well known that high-molecular weight proteins can be                 damaged by their interactions with surfaces.  The extent of damage              seems to be time-dependent.  It is hypothesized that this damage                occurs as the protein unfolds to bring more of its surface into                 contact with regions of the surface to which they are attracted.  This          phenomenon is important to both biomedical technology and downstream            processing in biotechnology.  If the protein unfolds as it interacts            progressively strongly with the surface, it seems reasonable to expect          the apparent thickness of a film of adsorbed protein to decrease with           time and for the amount of damage to correlate with the film                    thickness.  This project will test that hypothesis and lead to a                better understanding of the phenomenon and its dynamics.",
