This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support three research                      projects in the Department of Mathematics at the University of                  California, San Diego: Computer Explorations in Algebraic                       Combinatorics, directed by Adriano Garsia and Jeffrey Remmel;                   Feasible Logics for Programming and Proof Systems, directed by                  Jeffrey Remmel and Samuel Buss; and Hecke Algebras and                          Generalized Brauer Algebras, directed by Hans Wenzl.",
