 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Yang will work on a number of problems in random                 fields and Markov processes with local interactions. In both                    cases, a question of primary interest is the investigation and                  description of critical phenomena. Professor Yang will study the                critical dimensions of the scaling limits of self-avoiding random               walks and the structure of infinite volume limits of Markov                     processes with local interactions. He will also investigate the                 structure of the Gibbs state of lattice gas models with hard-                   core conditions and the differentiability of pressures of the                   system, and will give a description of how a non-equilibrium                    distribution approaches equilibrium in such models.                                  This project is research in a part of probability theory                   that is closely related to mathematical physics. The motivating                 physical problem is to predict the long-run behavior of systems                 of large numbers of interacting particles, based on information                 of a local nature about the interactions. Some of the techniques                of quantum field theory for investigating such systems turn out                 to be applicable to the study of certain kinds of random                        processes that arise in probability theory, for instance random                 motion constrained by the condition that the path of the randomly               moving point not cross itself.",
