 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the extent to which discursive                    practices are structured by region-specific native gender and                   class categories.  The investigator, a linguistic anthropologist,               will test three sets of hypotheses on gender and discursive                     practices which have been developed within the Durkheimian,                     rational-choice, and neo-Marxist theoretical frameworks.  These                 hypotheses will be tested in six communities in North and South                 Vietnam, which offers a valuable test case because the socio-                   cultural differences between North and South allow a controlled                 comparison.  The methods will include extensive formal                          interviewing and the extensive tape-recording and transcription                 of speech interactions.                                                                                                                                         This research is important because it will create a very valuable               data-set of naturally occurring speech from a developing country,               collected under controlled conditions.  The knowledge gained                    about language changes with respect to gender relations in a                    country undergoing rapid socio-economic change will be valuable                 as a comparison with gender relations in the developing world.                  The increased awareness of the theoretical importance of subtle                 markers of inequality such as speech patterns that can result                   from this research can help us understand how to deal with                      inequality.",
