 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Nevada System currently provides connectivity                 among its major campuses, the University of Nevada-Reno (UNR),                  University of Nevada-Las Vegas (UNLV), and the Desert Research                  Institute (DRI), using the Nevada State Microwave System (NSMS).                                                                                                Connectivity to NSFNET and the rest of the Internet would be                    provided by an NSF supported link from the UNLV campus to the San               Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) which is one of thirteen major                nodes on the NSFNET Backbone Network.  The current microwave                    system used by NSMS would need a modest enhancement of gateway                  hardware to link all three state campuses to the Internet link at               UNLV.                                                                                                                                                           The network would employ moderate speed links (56,000 bits per                  second) both within the state and on its link to the rest of the                Internet at the SDSC node of NSFNET.                                                                                                                            Significant cost-sharing is provided by using the Nevada State                  Microwave System for telecommunications and by using technical                  and user services provided by the University of Nevada System.",
