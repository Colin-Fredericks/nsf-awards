 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the homogeneity of                   segmental mixing in polymer blends in which a small number of                   interacting groups are responsible for miscibility.  Although                   specific interaction has proven to be very effective in promoting               miscibility, there are still unresolved questions about the                     molecular picture of the state of segmental intermixing.  Based                 on preliminary results, diffusional probes to study segment                     mobility in these blends will be used because the diffusion of a                small molecule in polymers involves the cooperative motion of                   only a small number of segments and provides information about                  the degree of mixing on a scale smaller than that associated with               the glass-transition phenomenon.  CP/MAS carbon-13 NMR studies                  will be carried out in parallel with diffusion experiments.  This               method offers the advantage in being able to determine the                      relaxation responses of each component in the blend independently               and should provide answers to the disposition of segments of                    otherwise immiscible polymers brought together by a small number                of interacting groups.",
