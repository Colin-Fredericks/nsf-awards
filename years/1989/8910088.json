 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because the environment in which a system will operate is often time            varying and cannot be predicted exactly by the designer, the                    development of adaptive controllers has been an extremely active                research area in the past ten years.  A large number of algorithms              have been proposed; however, with the exception of the example                  analysed in \u0131Meyn and Caines, 1987!, there have been no concrete                stability results for adaptive systems with non-trivial parameter               variation operating in a stochastic environment.                                                                                                                The proposed research considers the application of Markov chain                 techniques for the stability and performance analysis of short memory           adaptive algorithms.  Some of the basic issues to be address, and               techniques to be applied are:                                                                                                                                        *the analysis of practical algorithms:  The adaptive control               algorithms which are currently used in practice are not fully                   understood, and a new set of tools is needed to analyse their                   stability and performance characteristics.  Recent results of the               proposer are expected to make an important step towards fulfilling              this goal;                                                                                                                                                           *the adaptive control of time varying plants in a stochastic               setting is poorly understood.  A specific goal of the proposed                  research is to achieve a better understanding of the performance of             short memory algorithms using a test function approach initiated in             \u0131Meyn, 1989a!, and currently under investigation by the proposer;                                                                                                    *the proposed methods use an equivalent of the state space                 approach currently used in the local analysis of determistic adaptive           control systems;                                                                                                                                                     *these methods provide a means to study a combination of                   nonlinear and stochastic phenomena;                                                                                                                                  *it will be shown that these techniques have several important             advantages over current methods used to study stochastic adaptive               control algorithms particularly in regards to stability.",
