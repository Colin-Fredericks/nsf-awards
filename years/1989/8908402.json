 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economic theory is frequently criticized for assuming that                      economic agents are always rational.  But economic theories based               on more realistic assumptions about the way individuals decide                  have not been very productive.  The results from these                          \"realistic\" theories are sensitive to specific assumptions about                the decision rules used by agents.  This project promises to                    bridge the gap between traditional rational choice economic                     models and models based on more realistic decision rules.  In                   this project adaptive, heuristic decision rules emerge from                     individually rational behavior under imperfect information.                     Behavior predicted by the models of dynamic choice developed in                 this project conform to observed behavior, but the results are                  rigorously derived from general assumptions and yield useful                    insights.                                                                                                                                                       There are two parts to this project.  In the first, models are                  studied in which individuals play a game repeatedly, learning and               experimenting as they go.  A wide class of behavioral rules are                 shown to yield convergence to Nash equilibria.  Restrictions on                 individual behavior are related to various Nash equilibrium                     refinements.  This is important because Nash equilibria and Nash                refinements are mathematically tractable.  This part of the                     project could provide economic theorists with powerful                          mathematical tools for studying dynamic models of bounded                       rationality.                                                                                                                                                    In the second part, models are developed in which individuals                   have a general preference for flexibility because they know there               are future contingencies they cannot foresee.  Dynamic game                     theory and contract theory are used to study individual choice                  where the desire for flexibility changes with circumstances.                                                                                                    This project should be supported because of its contributions to                economic theory and decision theory.  Methodologically the                      project should provide economists with new approaches to                        modelling dynamic choice in a changing economy.  Substantively,                 the applications of the investigator's approaches to economic                   problems, especially his work in the first part of the project on               models of experimentation and learning, should provide important                new insights into a wide range of economic issues.",
