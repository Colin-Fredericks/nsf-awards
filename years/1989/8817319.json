 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanisms of mitosis will be studied in sea urchin eggs treated at             metaphase with 10 mM caffeine to produce large monasters.  These                monasters are, in effect, mitotic spindles turned inside out, and               because of their size and configuration, they provide many novel ways of        exploring the mitotic process.  The primary objectives of the proposed          research are:  1) To characterize the model system and compare it with          equivalent normal bipolar division stages, 2) To examine the transition         from one aster system to another, and 3) To compare chromosome                  movements, especially away from the aster center with congression of            chromosomes at the metaphase plate in normal division.   Methods will           include light microscopy of living eggs as well as fixed and stained            sections, low light level time-lapse video recording of fluorescently           labeled living eggs, and electron microscopy.  The results should               provide some insight into mitotic mechanisms as well as address the more        general problem of how a cell is able to restructure its tubulin                cytoskeleton in response to an internal or external stimulus.",
