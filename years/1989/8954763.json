 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association for the Advancement of Science                    proposes to explore alternative/innovative means to develop                     and implement student assessments in science, mathematics and                   technology. They seek funding to bring together three states                    who are in the vanguard of appropriate assessment efforts                       along with knowledgeable individuals engaged in the reforms                     of science and mathematics education and student assessment.                    The purpose of the meeting will be to explore the policy,                       technical, and content issues associated with innovative                        assessments which are consistent with the essential  content                    and learning goals of AAAS 2061 - Science for All Americans.                    The outcome of the meeting would be the determination of the                    need for (and if determined) plans for a large-scale                            conference to share plans with additional states and large                      local assessment programs. The three states -- California,                      Michigan, and Connecticut -- are in the process of developing                   large scale assessment programs in science education. All are                   committed to the use of 2061 as the basis for developing                        these assessments.//",
