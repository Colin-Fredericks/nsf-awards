 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Dr. Jeeva Anandan to carry out collaborative            research in theoretical physics with two European scientists:                   Professor Leo Stodolsky, Max Planck Institute for Physics and                   Astrophysics, Munich, Federal Republic of Germany and Professor                 Garry Gibbons, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical                Physics, University of Cambridge, England.                                                                                                                      The importance of geometric ideas in physics cannot be over                     emphasized. The geometrical reformulation of special relativity by              Minkowski, for example, enabled Einstein to create a new relativistic           theory of gravitation, namely general relativity.  Recently, a new              geometric concept was discovered in quantum theory, which is                    independent of space-time or gauge field geometries and depends on              the Hilbert space inner product only.  This began with the discovery            of a nonintegrable phase factor by Berry.  Although hundreds of                 papers have been written on the geometric phase, since the pioneering           work of Berry, there are still a number of deep fundamental                     unanswered questions, which Dr. Anandan proposals to investigate                during the period of proposed research.  These questions concern 1)             covariant formulation of the geometric phase 2) formulation in the              Heisenberg picture 3) invariant formulation of the geometric phase              4) experimental observation of the Fubini-Study metric 5) geometric             phase for equations that are second order in time 6) the classical              analog of the non abelian geometric phase 7) connection to the                  gravitational phase and 8) physical applications.  At the Max                   Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics, Dr. Anandan will                 work with Dr. Stodolsky on both the geometric phase and on a new                relativistic gravitational effect on charged particle interferometry.           At Cambridge University he will continue to study with Dr. Gibbons              the non adiabatic geometric phase.  The results of this research                should make an important contribution to the understanding of the               geometric phase in quantum mechanics.",
