 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall aim of this research is to understand the molecular               mechanisms by which substrates gain access to the                               glycosyltransferases during terminal glycosylation of secreted                  glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus.   Studies from several                    laboratories, including this one, have demonstrated that specific               carrier proteins are involved in transporting nucleotide sugars                 into the Golgi lumen and nucleotide products of the transferases                out of the lumen.  The specific goals of the project are to: (1)                identify the proteins responsible for UDP-galactose and UMP                     transport across Golgi membranes; (2) isolate and characterize                  the transport proteins; and (3) determine how the transporters                  are oriented in the membrane, and how they are distributed                      relative to galactosyltransferases.                                                                                                                             Perhaps the most striking thing about living cells is the very                  high degree of order and organization which is required for life                processes to occur.  The cell is compartmentalized into specific                regions which carry out specific functions, and this                            compartmentalization allows for a high degree of regulation of                  those functions with minimal interference from other cellular                   functions.  Some of these \"compartments\" consist of membrane-                   enclosed intracellular organelles, within which specific                        biochemical reactions occur.  In the case of post-translational                 processing of \"secretory\" proteins (including membrane proteins                 and lysosomal proteins, the biosyntheses of which also utilize                  the \"secretory pathway\"), late post-translational modification by               the addition of terminal sugars (and other substituents) takes                  place within the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, a complex                        collection of membrane-bound biosynthetic compartments to which                 the nascent proteins are transported.  The sugar transferase                    reactions require the participation of the membrane-bound                       transferase enzymes, the nascent glycoprotein, and the                          nucleotide-linked \"activated\" sugar substrates.  The activated                  nucleotide sugars are not biosynthesized within the Golgi lumen,                but elsewhere in the cell (usually in the cytoplasm).  These                    compounds do not readily cross biological membranes.  Similarly,                the resulting reaction product of the transferase reaction, free                nucleotide, also does not cross membranes readily.  Yet, it is                  critical for the nucleotide sugars to enter the lumen, and also                 critical for the reaction products (which would inhibit the                     reaction if allowed to acumulate) to exit from the site of the                  reaction.  By focusing on the transport and compartmentalized                   utilization of a particular nucleotide sugar, UDP-galactose, his                research will increase our understanding of how this delicate,                  yet critical, compartmentalization works in the living cell.",
