 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposed research program is to obtain a                         fundamental understanding of the structure and properties of                    tetrahedrally coordinated thin film surfaces and interfaces and                 their relationship to the physics and chemistry of deposition.                  Progress in these aspects of thin film science has been very slow               owing to the complexity of the plasma processes for deposition                  and the relative lack of in situ probes for studying nucleation,                and reactions at surfaces and interfaces, particularly in adverse               high pressure plasma environments.  In situ spectroscopic                       ellipsometry (SE) is a monolayer-sensitive, non-perturbative                    technique which will be applied to these problems.  A unique                    optical multichannel analyzer-based ellipsometry system in place                now permits collection of dielectric function spectra from 1.1 eV               to 4.5 eV with a minimum time resolution of less than one second.               This allows spectra to be taken at every Angstrom during the                    growth of these films.  A second instrument will also be                        developed under this proposal.  The materials to be studied are                 hydrogenated and hydrogen-free amorphous carbon and silicon as                  well as microcrystalline diamond.  The preparation capabilities                 will include plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD),                   heated filament enhanced CVD, remote plasma CVD, all from CH4 or                SiH4.  Physical vapor deposition techniques include evaporation,                with and without ion assist, dc planar magnetron sputtering, and                ion beam sputtering.  The studies will concentrate on the                       nucleation and interface structure of microcrystalline diamond                  thin films and the response of their surfaces to well-                          characterized inert and reactive ion beams.  Similar experiments                will be used to probe the nucleation, surface reactivity, and                   bonding for the Si-based films.  These experiments will be used                 to identify the physical factors which control film bonding and                 morphology.",
