 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic data storage and retrieval problems involve the representation          of data in memory in such a way as to permit certain types of                   modifications of the data (updates) and question about the data                 (queries).  The theory of data structures is concerned with finding             such representations that are efficient with respect to various                 criteria, such as time per operation and memory required.  On the other         hand it is important to understand the intrinsic limitations of                 efficiency for any implementation.  In the project, various data                structure problems are analyzed:  dynamic dictionary, orthogonal range          queries and union-find with the aim of proving lower bounds on their            complexities in the powerful cell-probe model of computation.  The              effect of register size on complexity and the relation between                  amortized and single operation complexity are being studied.  Other             topics outside of data structure theory are also being investigated,            including: the power of bounded depth threshold circuits and some               algorithmic problems in distributed computing.",
