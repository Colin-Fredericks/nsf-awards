The purpose of this research is to measure               the economic importance of the introduction of the electric                     telegraph in the United States the end of the of the last                       century.  Estimates will be developed of the costs to society at                that time of not having had available the technology of the                     telegraph for long distance communication.  An estimate of the                  costs to society will be based on the cost of replacing the                     service by some other  existing communication technology, like                  expanding the mail service at that time, together with the                      increased costs to the economic sectors purchasing communication                services.  This research is important because it looks at the                   economic development implications of the adoption of new                        communications technology.  Innovation in communications                        continues at a rapid pace to this day, and the results of this                  study should provide useful insights into the role of                           communication technology in economic growth and development                     process.",
