 "awd_abstract_narration": "At a technical level, Professor Wodzicki's project is                      largely concerned with computing the cyclic homology of algebras                that come, variously, from differential or algebraic geometry or                from functional analysis. Algebras of differential operators,                   especially on smooth analytic varieties, play a major role in                   this research, but there is also an important aspect of it that                 deals with C*-algebras (certain algebras of operators on Hilbert                space) and their K-theory and cyclic homology.                                       The mathematical research here envisioned is a far-reaching                outgrowth of calculus on manifolds, roughly surfaces and their                  higher-dimensional analogues. Differential operators, which come                from calculus, see the manifold only in small pieces, but                       nevertheless contain information about its overall shape and                    conformation. One strategy, relevant to the work of Professor                   Wodzicki, for extracting this sort of information from                          differential operators involves assembling the operators into                   algebraic structures and then using algebraic machinery. The                    further development of this machinery, two important and                        intimately related parts of which are called K-theory and cyclic                homology, and its use in elucidating geometric and topological                  structure constitute the agenda of the research supported by this               award.",
