 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of Dr. Price's research is to understand                the mechanism (or mechanisms) by which chemicals in the air                     stimulate olfactory receptor cells in the nose, thus leading to                 odor perception.  One mechanism suggested is that the odorous                   chemicals (odorants) bind to specific receptor proteins on the                  surface of the cells, which causes the cells to generate nerve                  impulses.  This research project will test the hypothesis that                  certain proteins isolated from the tissue containing olfactory                  receptor cells are, in fact, receptor proteins and a                            determination of the protein characteristics will be made.                                                                                                      Isolating the proteins by affinity chromatography takes advantage               of the fact that they bind certain odorants.  Odorant analogues                 are linked to solid supports and made into columns through which                tissue extracts are passed.  Proteins that bind odorants often                  bind the analogues as well.  The analogues are linked to the                    solid support, thus these proteins are separated from the                       thousands of other chemicals in the extracts.  The proteins are                 recovered by washing the solid support-analogue-protein complex                 with concentrated solutions of the analogue.                                                                                                                    Binding an odorant does not prove that a protein is a receptor.                 This problem is approached by preparing antibodies that interact                with different parts of the protein (so-called monoclonal                       antibodies).  The antibodies are applied to olfactory receptor                  tissue and responses to odorants are measured.  If the protein is               a receptor, some of the antibodies should prevent it from binding               the odorant and, therefore, inhibit responses.  Two proteins have               been isolated from olfactory tissue and subjected to this test.                 The results suggest that they are receptors.                                                                                                                    Receptor proteins are hypothesized to comprise a family of                      similar proteins.  Some antibodies against each of the two                      proteins mentioned inhibit responses to several unrelated                       odorants.  This finding is consistent with the stated hypothesis;               the antibodies probably interact with part of the protein that is               common to all receptor proteins.                                                                                                                                The two proteins are indistinguishable by electrophoresis, which                estimates protein size on the basis of the rate at which it moves               in an electric field.  This, too, is consistent with the                        hypothesis that receptor proteins comprise a structural class.                                                                                                  These studies are intended to elaborate upon the investigations                 described above by seeking and comparing additional proteins.                   Samples will be provided to other investigators for use in their                experiments on olfactory mechanisms.",
