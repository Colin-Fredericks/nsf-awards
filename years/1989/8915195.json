The award will permit this                    student to make several trips to a research site for work                       preliminary to her dissertation. The topic of her work is the                   Cuban community in Miami and the relationship between the sources               of division within the community (time of emigration, social and                economic status, age) and both assimilation and ideological                     positioning. This award grows out of a special directorate level                program to enhance the graduate education of previous applicants                of minority fellowship programs receiving honorable mention                     ratings. This award should strengthen minority research                         participation in sociology.",
