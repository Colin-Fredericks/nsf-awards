 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant issued to Rockefeller University is for                the purpose of convening a workshop to help develop a national                  research agenda in the area of collaboration technology in                      support of scientific research. The NSF's Information Technology                and Organizations Program has recently established the first                    federal government program explicitly designed to support                       research on \"computer supported cooperative work\" and on related                issues of coordination theory and technology. This workshop will                help to further develop this program and also will define                       collatoral research needs in technology development, development                of group interfaces, needed research on networks to enable these                activities, and other research requirements.                                      Of special interest for this workshop is a research and                       development program leading to an electronic \"collaboratory\", a                 \"center without walls,\" in which the nation's researchers can                   perform their research--interacting with colleagues, accessing                  instrumentation, using data and computational resources,                        accessing information in digital libraries--without regard to                   geographical location.                                                            The workshop will bring to bear on this assignment thirty of                  the nation's best minds on the subjects of concern. Rockefeller                 University hosts this workshop on March 12, 13 and 14, 1989, in                 New York City. The workshop results in a report containing the                                                                                                  research agenda and recommendations for organizing to accomplish                                                                                                the research.",
