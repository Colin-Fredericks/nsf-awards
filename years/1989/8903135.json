 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amorphous metals represent a novel class of materials which                     exhibit new bulk and surface properties.  Many amorphous metals                 show higher catalytic activity and selectivity than their                       crystalline counterparts.  The freedom from thermodynamic                       constraints permits use of the amorphous phase as precursor to                  other unique metastable phases.  Co-condensation is a very                      versatile method for preparing new amorphous metals and other                   metastable alloys with unusual properties.  The direct                          combination of this method with modern surface characterization                 and catalytic testing produces a powerful approach to attack the                fundamental questions associated with the unique surface                        properties of amorphous metals.  A unique facility which permits                preparation, characterization, study of surface reactivity and                  catalytic testing of amorphous alloys without removing the sample               from the pristine environment of the UHV chamber has been                       developed with State of Texas support.  In this proposal they are               requesting funds to use this approach to study the surface                      structure and chemistry of amorphous refractory alloys to                       provide an understanding of their surface reactivity and basic                  information needed to ultimately explain unusual catalytic and                  corrosion properties.  This proposal brings together the unique                 experience of D. L. Cocke in studying alloy surface reactivity                  with that of D. G. Naugle in the study and preparation of bulk                  and thin film amorphous metals to attack fundamentally the                      technologically important surface properties of amorphous                       materials.  They emphasize that the major facilities for this                   innovative proposal are already in place; consequently, the                     principal need is for longer term operational funds.",
