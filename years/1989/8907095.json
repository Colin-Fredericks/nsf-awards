(SURA) will            render logistical services in coordinating for the Computer and                 Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Directorate of NSF an NSFnet         Orientation and Training Workshop for Minority Institutions (NOT-MI).           The workshop will be held at the Continuous Electronic Beam Accelerator         Facility (CEBAF) in Newport News, Virginia.  SURAnet is a regional              network of 52 nodes in the Southeast United States which provides user          services and connection to the NSFnet.  They seek to extend the network         and services to all research and teaching institutions in the                   Southeast, including historically black colleges.  Most of the nations          predominantly minority institutions are located in the SURAnet area.                                                                                            NOT-MI will begin on the evening of June 21, 1989 and terminate in the          afternoon of June 23, 1989.  Participation will be limited and include          selected institutions receiving Foundation support under: 1) the                Comprehensive Regional Centers for Minorities, 2) the Minority Research         Centers of Excellence, and 3) the Institutional Infrastructure-Minority         Institutions Program.  Approximately 40 attendees are expected.                                                                                                 NOT-MI will allow computer networking experts and users to present              instructions on internet technology, major protocols, principles and            applications with hands-on experiences to educators/researchers and             technical specialist of minority institutions that can readily benefit          from NSFnet connection.",
