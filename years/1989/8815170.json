 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to reconstruct the history of                     climate in the northwestern United States during the last                       deglaciation.  It includes a field program in Montana and Oregon                to collect cores in lakes and bogs, and laboratory analysis of                  the samples for pollen fossils.  These new data will be combined                with some existing pollen data in this region to produce maps of                the distribution of vegetation throughout this period of rapid                  climate change.  The project will test two hypotheses: 1) that                  the atmospheric circulation changes induced by the melting of the               ice sheet resulted in a time-transgressive sequence of climate                  change from west to east and from north to south in this region;                and 2) that the effects of the summer insolation maximum produced               a differential climate response from west to east.  The results                 of this research will provide important climatic boundary                       conditions in a region where present sample coverage is poor.",
