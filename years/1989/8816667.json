 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to investigate the petrogenesis of the Kolekole                 Volcanics, which represent the products of the last eruptive                    activity of the Waianae Volcano of Oahu, Hawaii.  In some                       respects the Kolekole can be considered the rejuvenation state of               the Waianae Volcano.  However, unlike most rejuvenation stage                   volcanism in Hawaii, the Kolekole appears to be closely related                 temporally and chemically to earlier phases of Waianae activity.                The PIs will investigate this relationship through studies of the               field relations, petrology and geochemistry, and radiometric                    dating of the Kolekole and underlying lavas.  In particular they                propose to test: 1) whether or not Kolekole Volcanics could have                been derived from similar sources as the shield and post-shield                 Waianae Volcanics, and by what sort of melting processes, and 2)                the nature and depth of fractionation affecting Kolekole magmas,                principally by modeling Kolekole lava variations using mineral                  mocpositions of included phenocrysts, xenocrysts and xenoliths.                 Data obtained in this study will greatly increase our knowledge                 of Hawaiian volcanic field relations, chemistry and evolution of                Hawaiian alkalic magmas.  It should provide the first accurate                  dates of Kolekole volcanism.",
