 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to deal effectively with the most common             complaint about engineering graduates; their lack of communication              skills.  Traditional public speaking and technical writing courses,             although extremely valuable, are not solving the problem.  The written,         oral and graphic communication skills of engineering students at                Clemson University are being improved through the Effective Technical           Communications (ETC) program which has the following objectives:                                                                                                     1.  Integrate technical communication exercises throughout the                          engineering curriculum                                                                                                                                  2.  Provide students with a condensed manual for written, oral and                        graphic communications.                                                                                                                               3.  Provide modern equipment and techniques to aid preparation and                        feedback.                                                                                                                                             4.  Use communication exercises to enhance learning of the                      technical         material being presented.                                                                                                                Planning began in 1982, and a team of Engineering and English faculty           completed the Effective Technical Communications Manual 1986.  An               alumnus provided a $1.0 million endowment of a joint                            English/Engineering chair in technical communications, the first such           chair in the nation.  A pilot project involving 160 students began in           Fall 1986, and expanded to 300 students in Spring 1987.  Selected               technical courses include written, oral and graphical exercises which           are dual graded by engineering and english faculty.  In Fall 1987, the          program was expanded to several courses throughout the College of               Engineering, and more that 600 students are involved.  In order to              fully integrate the ETC program into the curriculum and serve the 3300          students in the College of Engineering, a special facility for                  preparing written, oral and graphical communication materials will be           necessary.  The facility will contain computers, laser printers, video          equipment, and graphic display/printers to enable students and faculty          to utilize the latest techniques in a technical communications.  The            ETC concept has been presented at several national meetings and has             generated inquires from more that 40 institutions.  It is a unique              approach to a major problem.",
