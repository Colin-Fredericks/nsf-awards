 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous work of Dr. Shapirio has reinforced the view of                        bacterial colonies as highly organized, differentiated structures               with specific developmental histories. Work with E. coli strains                carrying various lac fusion elements has raised detailed                        questions about the cellular and molecular events involved in                   pattern formation during colony development.  Some of these                     questions pertaining to patterns of cellular differentiation can                be answered by a more detailed microscopic analysis of colony                   structure using histochemical, immunological and in situ                        hybridization technologies.  Identification of the components of                multicellular control systems will be initiated by standard                     molecular genetic methods (transposon mutagenesis, cloning and                  testing of known regulatory mutations). Further material for                    identifying currently unpredictable changes in morphogenetic                    regulatory systems has become available through the appearance of               sectors containing bacteria that display novel hereditary                       patterns of gene expression, colony development and cell                        division.  The novel phenotypes expressed by these bacteria can                 be characterized by the same methods that will be applied to                    normal colonies, and the nature of the hereditary changes in them               can be examined by DNA transfer and cloning procedures. Once all                these studies have begun to provide a more precise picture of                   colony structure and its underlying genetic control, it will be                 possible to begin investigating what happens when many bacterial                cells in a multicellular inoculum organize themselves to undergo                a regular developmental sequence.                                               %%%                                                                             Dr. Shapiro has provided some evidence that colony development in               bacteria shows some distinct temporal changes in morphology. He                 proposes that this can be used as a model to obtain information                 about how multicellular organisms develop and differentiate. His                work is unique in this area and could lead to the development of                powerful models for the study of differentiation.",
