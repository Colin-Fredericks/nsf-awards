 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by six U.S.                   Scientists in a joint symposium: \"Effective Management of Science and           the Development and Transfer of Technology\" which is organized by the           American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the              Bangladesh Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) and is             scheduled for March 21-24, 1989 in Dhaka, Bangladesh.  Objectives of            the symposium include:  identification and characterization of the              scientific and technical capabilities of Bangladesh; review and                 identification of needed changes in the management of science and               technology in that country; identification of the science and                   technology needs of the industrial and agricultural sectors and ways            to incorporate the capabilities in universities and other research              institutions in the development of technology.  The symposium agenda            will include:  curricula in universities and relationship to needs in           industry; development of an adequate infrastructure in science and              engineering; policies to enhance interaction with international                 academic and research organizations; intellectual property issues;              and support of R&D by domestic enterprises and multinational concerns.          The Bangladesh coordinator is Dr. M. Shamsul Haq, President of BAAS.                                                                                            Scope:  The project involves a prestigious U.S. organization, the AAAS,         and its Bangladesh counterpart.  Previous joint activities, including           a 1985 meeting, have resulted in concrete steps to focus the                    collaboration between these two organizations on strengthening the              infrastructure of science and Technology in Bangladesh.  This project           is likely to lead to further steps of collaberation by BAAS with the            AAAS and with other international science and Technol ogy organi-               zations, and in turn to improving the effectiveness of the science              and technology infrastructure in Bangladesh.",
