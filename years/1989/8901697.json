 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports a FASEB Summer Research Conference on Genetic               Recombination and Genome Rearrangements, held July 9-14, 1989 in                Copper Mountain, Colorado.  The conference is under the auspices                of the Federation of the American Societies of Experimental                     Biology (FASEB).  The format of this meeting will be the same as                that used by the Gordon Research Conferences.  There will be nine               major sessions with 36 invited speakers.  The chairperson of each               session will give an introductory talk on the historical                        background and the current problems to acquaint all participants                with the topics in that session.  Poster sessions will be held                  throughout the meeting.  Informal workshops of small groups will                be arranged before or at the meeting.                                                                                                                           This conference is the only regularly scheduled meeting in the                  United States that is devoted exclusively to genetic                            recombination and genome rearrangements.  The topics to be                      covered at this meeting are current approaches to gene therapy,                 genome rearrangements that lead to cancer, genetics of homologous               recombination, enzymology of homologous recombination (strand                   transferases, nucleases, and resolvases), physical structure of                 recombination intermediates, repair of mismatch sites in                        heteroduplex recombination intermediates, site-specific                         recombination and regulation of gene expression, and bacterial                  and eukaryotic transposition.",
