 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems in this program are in the area of overlap                    between low-dimensional topology and combinatorial group                        theory.  W. Thurston's work indicates that the most interesting                 3-manifolds are hyperbolic, i.e. ones that admit a Riemannian                   metric of constant negative curvature.  By letting a sequence                   of such structures degenerate, a tree is obtained.  The first                   problem is to understand the space of actions of a group on                     trees.  The motivating question here is whether or not the                      space of simplicial actions is dense in the space of all                        actions.                                                                             The second problem is to bound the complexity of                           3-orbifolds in terms of their fundamental groups.  A main                       question here is whether there is a bound (in terms of the                      number of generators needed for the group) for the number of                    conjugacy classes of maximal finite subgroups.                                       There is a generalization, due to M. Gromov, to arbitrary                  groups of the notion of hyperbolicity of the fundamental group                  of a closed manifold.  The final problem is to show that the                    fundamental group of a mapping cylinder of an irreducible                       automorphism of a free group is hyperbolic in this sense.                            All the problems have in common that they heavily mix                      topology and some other branch of mathematics, geometry or                      algebra, or both.  This is a perennial phenomenom in                            mathematics, but it waxes and wanes.  At the moment projects                    which form bridges between neighboring fields are                               proliferating.  The trend to blur boundaries, as in this                        project, is particularly pronounced.",
