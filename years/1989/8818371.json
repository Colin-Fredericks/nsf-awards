 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lamellar transition metal phosphorus trichalcogenides form an               important family of two-dimensional semiconducting materials.                   These compounds are of interest to researchers because of their                 highly two-dimensional physical properties and their unusual                    solid-state chemistry.  The layered lattices exhibit solid-state                \"intercalation\" reactions in which molecules insert between                     lattice planes.  The process of intercalation often results in                  dramatic and unpredictable modification of the chemical and                     physical properties of the host lattice.  Although the                          intercalation reactions have been studied for more than two                     decades, many interesting questions of mechanism and structure in               the solid-state intercalation chemistry of these materials remain               unresolved.  The research described in this proposal is directed                toward an improved understanding of the mechanism of                            intercalation in these materials.                                               Charge balance is an important constraint to the intercalation of               cationic species and may be achieved by elimination of lattice                  cations.  It is proposed to utilize electron spin resonance (ESR)               spectroscopy to study the complex equilibrium between inter-                    lamellar and intra-lamellar cations.  In many reactions a                       mechanism is involved in which an electron is transferred to an                 unidentified site in the host lattice.  They propose to utilize                 photoluminescence and optically detected magnetic resonance                     (ODMR) spectroscopy to determine the lattice reduction site.",
