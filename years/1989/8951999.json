 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Western Piedmont Community College Chemistry Improvement               Project allowed the upgrade and expansion of undergraduate                      curricula in General Chemistry, Inorganic and Organic Chemistry                 for freshman non-science transfer students and pre-professional                 and technical associate degree students.  The research and                      industry-standard laboratory equipment acquired with the NSF                    grant permitted the following objectives to the achieved:  (1)                  the introduction of new gas chromatography exercises,  (2) the                  introduction of new visible and infrared spectrophotometric                     exercises,  (3) the teaching of computer assisted analytical                    skills for data acquisition and manipulation, and   (4) the                     opportunity for students to acquire hands-on experience with                    sophisticated laboratory equipment.  Important scientific                       concepts previously taught with audio-visual aids and visits to                 university and industry laboratories are now integrated into                    campus classroom and laboratory instruction.  The institution is                matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
