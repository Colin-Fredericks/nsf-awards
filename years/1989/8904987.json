 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of timing, size and rupture geometry of past                   earthquakes provide the most direct basis on which to determine                 past seismic periodicity and to predict future activity.                        However, seismographically recorded earthquake histories are too                short for this approach.  Some coasts in Vanuatu, Southwest                     Pacific, uplift during each interplate thrust zone earthquake,                  and the uplift raises shallow-living coral colonies above sea                   level and kills them.  The characteristic coral morphology of                   these events, combined with recently refined thermal ionization                 mass spectrometric 230th dating makes it possible to date these                 events precisely and thereby determine the coseismic uplift                     history.  This project, collaborative with EAR89-04705, will                    collect a suite of corals showing uplift-kill morphology along                  several segments of central Vanuatu and conduct 230th age dating.               Results will allow calculation of coseismic uplift periodicity                  and since Vanuatu is considered a weakly coupled subduction zone,               results will also help in calculating the proportion of aseismic                vs. seismic slip and determine at what point in the earthquake                  cycle the aseismic slip occurs.",
