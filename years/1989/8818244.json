 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative study of the transformations of dissolved                  inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) (both               N and C) by phytoplankton and bacterioplankton will be conducted                during the spring plankton bloom period in the Eastern North                    Atlantic Ocean.                                                                      Observational studies of DIN and DOM fluxes have stimulated                network models which consider together DIN and DOM flows as                     inputs and outputs of functionally-defined groups of organisms.                 Fixation of DIN by phytoplankton and of DOM and NH4 by                          bacterioplankton often dominate the flow of Nitrogen in the                     euphotic zone. Informed by this conceptualization of plankton                   dynamics, the study will follow the transformations of Nitrogen,                beginning with the transport of nitrate-Nitrogen (NO3) to the                   upper ocean during the spring, its fixation by phytoplankton, and               its regeneration and cycling by bacteria and other microplankton.               The objectives include:                                                         a) precisely quantifying the euphotic zone supply, stock and                    utilization of NO3; b) determining via new high precision                       techniques, the reliance of primary production on new and                       regenerated nutrients; c) assessing the significance of bacterial               production in general, of bacteria as competitors with                          phytoplankton for NH4; d) determining the impact of microbial                   regeneration of NH4 on the availability of Nitrogen for primary                 production; and finally e) evaluating the relationship between                  phytoplankton and bacterial production and the export of PON and                POC over time scales of days-weeks.",
