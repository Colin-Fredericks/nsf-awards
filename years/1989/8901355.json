 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modification of cloud processes to influence quantity and                types of precipitation remains a scientific and technical                       challenge.  Although many modification theories have been                       advanced, the complexity and variability of natural precipitation               production has limited predictable application.  It is unlikely                 that advances in weather modification can be made by field                      experimentation alone.  Numerical models of precipitation                       processes are now of sufficient sophistication that they can                    contribute much to our understanding.                                              The primary objective of the research is to gain further                     understanding of the effects of ice-phase seeding on the                        formation of rain and hail.  Results from advanced, time                        dependent models in two and three spatial dimensions will be used               in comparison with actual observations of seeded and unseeded                   convective clouds to ascertain important physical processes in                  cloud modification.  Secondary objectives are to study the                      transport of seeding materials and to conduct tests using                       two-dimensional models as a forecast aid.  The Principal                        Investigators will undertake this research as part of a                         joint NSF/NOAA experiment on the modification of convective                     clouds known as the North Dakota Thunderstorm Project.//",
