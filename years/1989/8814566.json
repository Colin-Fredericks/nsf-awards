 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator (PI) proposes to explore aspects of                non-product-form networks.  His approach assumes a more                         realistic type of model than the so-called product form in which                the stationary distribution of queues at network nodes over the                 entire network can be written as the product of distributions at                the individual nodes as if each of the nodes was operation in                   isolation.  If either or both of two assumptions, finite buffer                 size at each node and exogenous Poisson arrivals and/or                         exponential service times are eliminated, then the overall queue                distribution is no longer of product form and analysis becomes                  intractable.  Professor Tsoucas considers the case when neither                 assumption holds.  He proposes to study the computational                       problem that results when product form is absent, emphasize                     parallel asynchronous relaxation procedures, formulate an analog                of the \"folk\" theorem for delays, and consider qualitative                      properties of the throughput in blocking systems. ***",
