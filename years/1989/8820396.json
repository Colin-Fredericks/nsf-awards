 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two hormones control the cycles of growth, molting and regeneration in          arthropod animals (insects and crustaceans).  In crustaceans, one of            the hormones is ecdycsone, chemically a steroid, that directly controls         the cycles.  Ecdysone is secreted by glands (Y-organs) in the body              cavity.  Secretion by the Y-organs is controlled in turn by the second          hormone, molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) which is chemically a protein            and is secreted by specialized nerve cells in the brain.  This system           is analogous to that in the human and other vertebrates (adrenal                cortex, ovary and testis) that secrete steroid hormones and that are            governed by protein hormones from the brain/pituitary gland.  However,          the crustacean system is simpler in cell structure and metabolism.  For         this reason, the system is being used as a model for studying the               details of how cells take up cholesterol (the universal precursor of            steroid hormones) and process it for hormone synthesis, and how neural          hormones control these events.  The focus of this project is to uncover         the mechanism by which cholesterol enters Y-organ cells in light of             findings that cholesterol is presented to the cells bound up in high-           density lipo-protein (HDL).  Specific receptors for HDL on the cell             surface, how the complex is broken down in the cell and how and where           the freed cholesterol is processed into hormone will be examined.               Attendant studies will explore how MIH modifies cell function to slow           or stop hormone biosynthesis.  In this regard, crustaceans appear to be         unique among animals; a theoretically significant aspect of this model          is that the brain hormone (MIH) regulates negatively, whereas in all            other known systems the corresponding hormone is stimulatory.                   Techniques will include use of radioactive tracers, the electron                microscope, the ultracentrifuge and high-pressure liquid                        chromatography.                                                                                                                                                 This research embraces the fields of neurobiology, endocrinology and            developmental biology in addressing basic questions on coordination of          bodily functions.  Results should have eventual application of clinical         medicine in the areas of steroid endocrinology, reproductive                    physiology, pathologies of glands and atherosclerosis (arising from             defects in cholesterol metabolism).  Also, knowledge gained will add to         understanding the arthropod molting/growth cycle, a developmental               process that dominates the existance of this abundant, economically             important group of animals.",
