 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues previous work on the creation of a very                  large data set, the \"Penn World Table\",  which enables                          policymakers and researchers to compare countries around the                    world in ways not possible working with the data released by                    individual countries or the various international agencies.  In                 addition to wide dissemination of these \"real\" data,  this                      project analyzes on a selective basis the data in conjunction                   with associated International Comparison Project (ICP) benchmark                data.                                                                                                                                                           The System of National Accounts of the United Nations and other                 international agencies provides standardized data on expenditures               and prices for many countries.  While useful for making judgments               about changes over time in individual countries,  these data are                of limited value in comparing different countries because they                  are denominated in the national currencies of the individual                    countries.  The upcoming Mark 5 version of the Penn World Table                 (PWT5),  the next step in the investigators' construction of a                  System of Real National Accounts,  utilizes the price information               collected in the latest (1985) benchmark study of the ICP as well               as the earlier studies to convert national currency expenditures                to a common currency unit.  For purposes of productivity                        comparisons,  some attempt will be made to deal with the                        production side of the national accounts as well as the                         expenditure side,  the usual focus of the ICP and PWT.                                                                                                          The analysis component of this project focuses on the price and                 quantity structures of countries at different income levels.  The               structures,  estimated from PWT5 and ICP benchmark data,  are                   examined to see the patterns of change associated with economic                 development.  In the absence of the basic data developed by the                 project,  it has been impossible to analyze definitively these                  and other critical issues of comparative economic performance.",
