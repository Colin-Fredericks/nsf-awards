 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is Expedited Award for Novel Research will initiate the                    development of a class of computationally efficient, high-order                 adaptive numerical methods for partial differential equations based on          the use of splines.  These methods will be developed for, and applied           to field problems in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.  Box                spline methods were recently developed numerical schemes which provide          a general framework for generating piecewise polynomial representation          to solutions with any desired smoothness and order of approximation.                                                                                            By combining adaptive features with the advantages of box spline                method, algorithms for a number of numerically difficult problems such          as the forced cavity flow and the Landau-Lifschitz equations which              describe the time evolution of magnetization in ferromagnets.  The              Principle Investigator will work closely with members of the Howard             University Electrical Engineering Department.",
