 "awd_abstract_narration": "This statistics research project uses hierarchical and                     empirical Bayes methods to choose between two nested regression                 models for estimating the response function.  The estimators                    serve as a weighted average of the least squares estimators based               on the full and the reduced models with weights being dependent                 on the data. These estimators lean more toward the least squares                estimators based on the full models if the observed ratio                       suggests a full model, and towards the least squares estimators                 based on the reduced model if the opposite is true.                                  This project is in the general area of statistics and                      probability and applies hierarchical and empirical Bayes methods                in areas of survey sampling, linear models, and quality                         assurance.  In sample surveys, the research focuses on small area               estimation.  In such cases, typically a few examples are                        available from an individual area, and estimates of parameters of               interest for a certain area or simultaneously for several areas                 can be improved by incorporating information from similar                       neighboring areas.",
