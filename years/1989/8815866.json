 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program in theoretical condensed matter physics which                will increase our knowledge and understanding of surface physics,               the anharmonic properties of crystals and surfaces, and the                     properties of semiconductors is planned.  The study of surface                  physics will include theoretical determinations of the dispersion               curves for surface phonons on low index surfaces of metals, the                 amplification of surface polaritons, the propagation of surface                 polaritons in superlattices layered parallel or perpendicular to                the free surface of the sample, and the properties of localized                 interface and impurity states in quasicrystals.  Computer                       simulation studies of the anharmonic properties of crystals and                 surfaces will provide results for thermodynamic properties and                  excitation lifetimes that are correct to all orders in the                      anharmonicity.  Phonon transport phenomena in dielectric                        crystals, such as phonon viscosity, thermal conductivity, and                   ultrasonic attenuation, will be studied on the basis of numerical               solutions of the linearized Peierls Boltzmann equation for                      realistic crystal models.  The linewidths of surface phonons due                to lattice anharmonicity will also be investigated.  A                          theoretical effort will be made on the excitations and                          statistical mechanics of bounded nonlinear media.  Theoretical                  investigations into the properties of semiconductors will focus                 on the lifetimes of excited impurity states and the effects of                  electron-phonon interaction on impurity states in silicon                       inversion layers.  Localized electronic states in compensated                   semiconductors will also be studied.",
