 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the late 1970's and early 1980's two satellite                          experiments were launched to measure the solar irradiance,                      sometimes called the \"solar constant\".  These two satellite                     experiments have shown quite clearly that the solar irradiance                  varies on time scales from minutes to years.  The largest                       amplitude variations occur on time scales of 5 to 7 days and are                clearly associated with the passage of large sunspot groups                     across the face of the sun.  Ironically, the highest values of                  solar irradiance are during the peak of the solar cycle when the                average area of sun spots is much larger than at other times.                   The enhanced irradiance near solar maximum may be due to the                    presence of large areas of faculae, magnetic field regions seen                 in white light near the limb as bright patches were thought to be               too faint and too scarce to cause a significant change in solar                 irradiance compared to sunspots.  The work at the SFO over the                  last six years has shown that faculae are indeed important                      sources of emission.  In particular, it was shown for a group of                large sunspots in 1982 that the emission from faculae                           approximately balanced the blocking of sunspots.  The fragments                 of magnetic fields scattered across the sun, part of what is                    called the photospheric network, may be responsible for the                     surplus of emission that is seen at the time of the solar                       maximum.  By obtaining accurate photometric images of the sun at                various wavelengths, it is intended to determine the effects of                 sunspots, faculae and the network in the measurements of                        satellite irradiance monitors and permit the search for even more               subtle solar effects.  The results of this work may help to                     better predict the effects of the solar magnetic cycle on the                   earth's climate.",
