 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support is for a historical                 investigation of the effect that direct foreign investment has                  on the vitality and integration of a dependent economy.  The                    major theoretical question of interest, which has been derived                  from dependency theory, is the degree to which direct foreign                   investment serves to block the integration of local economic                    actors in the dependent economy and thus distort its development.                                                                                               Although dependency theory argues that this is often the case,                  conventional theories suggest that direct foreign investment                    actually spurs the growth of the dependent economy by producing a               \"multiplier effect\" so that growth in the leading sectors                       receiving the foreign investment spills over throughout the rest                of the economy via the creation of new commercial ties in the                   local economy.  This is what economists sometimes refer to as the               creation of \"forward and backward linkages\" in the dependent                    economy.                                                                                                                                                        The research is designed to provide a thorough investigation of                 these issues by analyzing statistically 40 years of data about                  Puerto Rico from the mid 1940s to the 1980s, drawn from four different          levels of analysis:  the aggregate economy as a whole, the eight                basic economic sectors, selected industries, and selected                       individual firms.  The sectoral, industry, and firm data sets,                  each of which contain up to forty years of data, will each form a               pooled time-series data set.  These will be analyzed so that                    comparisons can be drawn between sectors, industries and firms                  that exhibit relatively greater amounts of direct foreign                       investment, and those with smaller amounts.  Results from each of               these levels will then be compared as a cross check on each                     other.                                                                                                                                                          The importance of this research lies in its potential to clarify                the nature of the effect that direct foreign investment has on                  dependent economies.  In particular, this study draws attention                 to two key relationships:  the link between the level of direct                 foreign investment and the strength of commercial ties linking                  businesses in the local economy, and the relationship between the               strength of these commercial ties and developmental outcomes in                 the dependent economy, such as unemployment, capital formation,                 and capital repatriation.                                                                                                                                       Focusing on these relationships is important since forward and                  backward linkages play a key role in shaping economic development               in dependent economies.  If the Puerto Rican case shows that                    direct foreign investment actually serves to weaken the                         commercial ties among local businesses, and if this in turn can                 be linked to the levels of unemployment and capital formation,                  then an important part of the process that lies behind what is                  vaguely termed \"dependency\" will have been uncovered.",
