 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program will provide support to Dr. Hans                  J. Reich in the Department of Chemistry at the University of                    Wisconsin in Madison.  The work will develop the synthetic                      potential of the main group by unraveling the nature of some of                 the intermediates and applying this knowledge to develop                        greater synthetic control.  The synthesis of the complex                        molecules utilized by modern agriculture and medicine requires                  highly sophisticated synthetic methodology.                                                                                                                     This research is in several areas of main group organometalloid                 and organometallic chemistry.  Specifically, experiments aimed                  at elucidating the mechanism of some important metathesis                       reactions of organolithium reagents, the metal-halogen exchange                 and the transmetallation reaction of organotin compounds, are                   described.  Since these reactions are widely used in                            preparative organic chemistry it is important to understand                     them mechanistically.  The experiments described will clarify                   the role that ate complexes play in the chemistry of                            organolithium reagents, and will establish whether the                          complexes themselves are useful carbanion donors.  A new                        technique for determining geometry of nucleophilic attack at                    non-stereogenic centers (divalent tellurium) will be examined.                  An exploratory study will establish whether a dynamic NMR                       technique which has provided detailed information concerning                    the mechanism of the degenerate Li/I exchange between                           phenyllithium and iodobenzene, can also be used to study                        enolate reactions.                                                                                                                                              The second part concerns the design of a chiral electrophilic                   selenenylation agent.  The reagent is designed to utilize the                   geometry of hypervalent organoselenium species thought to be                    intermediates in the electrophilic addition of R-Se+ species to                 olefins.  The process, if successful, would provide a method                    for asymmetric oxidation of olefins to nonracemic allyl                         alcohols or lactones.                                                                                                                                           A third part involves the continuation of ongoing research to                   investigate the potential of using silyl ketones as precursors                  to carbonyl ylides.",
