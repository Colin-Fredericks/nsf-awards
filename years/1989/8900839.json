 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site award will support work of six undergraduate                 students investigating problems in the areas of number theory and               probability.  Students will be immersed in a graduate school type               setting involving seminars, individual research and presentation                of results.  Research topics include cyclotomic function fields;                rings of integers and prime factorization; unique factorization                 domains; Fibonacci sequences; continued fraction; probability                   bounds and linear programming.                                                       In algebraic function fields, the students' projects will                  deal with analogues to classical results from algebraic number                  fields.  Of particular interest will be efforts to discover                     analogues of fundamental principles regarding quadratic                         reciprocity.  The properties of the Fibonacci sequence modulo m                 has been the target of several recent investigations and work                   will continue on extensions of periodicity relations which have                 been established for certain special classes of moduli.                              Work in the area of probability will focus on obtaining                    information on joint probabilities when only partial information                is available on the individual events.  Exact solutions are                     replaced by bounds on the probability.  These questions lead                    naturally into interesting questions of multi-parametric linear                 programming problems which yield answers to questions of how one                can obtain the above bounds in an efficient manner.                                  The project will use resources from the Lehigh Valley                      Association of Independent Colleges including two faculty                       advisors.  It is expected that work completed under this award                  will be presented at the fourth meeting of the Annual Moravian                  Mathematical Student Conference in 1990.",
