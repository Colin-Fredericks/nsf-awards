 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the area of programming languages, research is underway to find              alternatives to languages like FORTRAN and C which were designed for            sequential computers.  These languages are designed around the concept          of storing into and reading from memory locations.  In contrast,                functional languages and logic programming languages are designed               around the concept of operations on values, rather than on storage              locations.  These languages appear to be more suitable for programming          parallel machines.  This project is unifying functional and logic               programming languages and giving these hybrid languages precise                 operational and denotational semantics.                                                                                                                         To execute programs in these languages, the project is designing a              parallel architecture that can exploit parallelism at all levels in the         program.  Existing multiprocessor architectures can exploit what is             called \"coarse-grain parallelism\" - for example, they can run different         iterations of a loop in parallel.  This approach misses out on 'fine-           grain' parallelism - for example, parallelism among the instructions of         a loop iteration.  Dataflow architectures can exploit fine-grain                parallelism but they do so at the price of considerable synchronization         overhead during program execution.  This project is defining a parallel         architecture that can exploit both fine-grain and coarse-grain                  parallelism without suffering the runtime overhead of pure dataflow             machines.                                                                                                                                                       Compiling programs for this architecture involves decomposing a program         into many processes and scheduling the operations within each process.          Process decomposition strategies based on exploiting spatial locality           of reference are being studied - as far as possible, code is placed on          the same processor as the data it manipulates.  This style of process           decomposition is useful even for conventional architectures like the            Intel iPSC/2 and the BBN Butterfly in which remote memory accesses take         much longer than local memory accesses.  In addition, algorithms for            static scheduling of loops and for software pipeling ofloop iterations          are being developed.",
