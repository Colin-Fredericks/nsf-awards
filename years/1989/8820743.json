 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on some principal consequences of the                     \"marriage squeeze\", the extent to which imbalances between the                  numbers of marriageable males and females affect marriage and                   divorce rates, fertility, and female labor force participation.                 The study addresses theoretically important questions as to the                 relationships between demographic characteristics of the                        population and opportunities of the individuals within it.                      Determining how women's marriage opportunities lead to variations               in marriage, marital and nonmarital fertility, labor force                      participation and divorce is  central to our understanding of                   these social processes.  The study also will address the question               of how black-white differences in marriage and other outcomes                   relate to marriage opportunities.  The project has three major                  objectives.  The first is to determine how the marriage squeeze                 for women varies by age, race, educational attainment and                       geographic area.   The second is to examine the effect of                       marriage opportunities on rates of marriage, fertility, labor                   force participation and divorce.  The third objective is to                     investigate how racial differences in marriage opportunities                    contribute to racial differences in marriage, fertility,                        illegitimacy, labor force participation and divorce.   Both 1980                Census data and data from the National Center for Health                        Statistics will be drawn upon to address these question.                                                                                                        The findings of this research will help clarify major                           questions in the study of women's lives.  While social and                      economic theorists have argued that a causal link exists between                women's marital opportunities and the roles they occupy, their                  theories have not been adequately tested.  The deficit of                       marriageable men has been hypothesized to produce low rates of                  marriage and fertility and higher rates of illegitimacy, divorce                and female labor force participation.  Dr. Scott analyzes these                 outcomes to test the assertion that the marriage squeeze is a                   powerful force shaping the lives of American women.  This                       analysis of marriage opportunities may be especially important in               gaining a broader understanding of the links between demographic                changes in the population and other societal changes.",
