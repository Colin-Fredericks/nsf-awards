 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the dissertation research of a cultural               anthropologist who will study the effect of biomedical training                 of traditional birth attendants (midwives) on maternal health in                Belize.  The objectives are to describe similarities and                        differences in the obstetric theory and practice of traditionally               and biomedically trained birth attendants, and to determine how                 these groups affect maternal mortality.  The methodology includes               participant observation, health histories and physical                          examinations.                                                                                                                                                   This research is important because child health and maternal                    illness are topics of major concern in the developing world.  The               understanding of how traditional knowledge and practice impact on               these can help health care policy makers design more effective                  programs.",
