 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to analyze the supply, factor demand, and              productivity responses of different manufacturing industries to changes         that occurred in the economic environment between the early 1970's and          the mid 1980's.  The data used to perform the analysis will be the              Longitudinal Establishment data set which includes information on the           entry and exist of plants.  An important feature that distinguishes             this study from previous ones is that this analysis allows for                  systematic differences among firms, so that firms can react differently         to the same change in the economic environment.  Exit of a firm from an         industry will be modeled as an optimal response of a firm to the                evolution of its own, and the industry's environment.  Industry                 response to economic change will be estimated by summing the responses          of all existing firms and new entrants.                                                                                                                         By explicitly modelling the diversity of firm responses, it will be             possible to produce a much richer analysis of industry dynamics.  Of            particular interest, will be predictions of the model's estimated               parameters with respect to the response of industry investment, output,         measured productivity, and job turnover rates, on the one hand, and to          technical developments on the other.   This research is important               because there are anomalies that have occurred in all of these                  responses during the period under study that traditional models have            not been able to explain.",
