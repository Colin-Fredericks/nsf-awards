 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological and economic changes are making it practical to configure         computer systems with larger and larger main memories.  The                     availability of large memories will affect the design of applications           running on these systems.  This project focuses on one common and               important application, namely transaction processing systems.                                                                                                   A preliminary version of System M, a testbed transaction processing             system designed from scratch for a large memory environment has been            implemented.  Currently, System M assumes that a complete copy of the           database resides in volatile main memory.  This assumption will be              modified and System M enhanced to take advantage of the complete                storage environment that can be expected for future transaction                 processing systems.  This environment will include large amounts of             main memory, non-volatile main memory, and slower non-volatile media            such as magnetic and optical disks.                                                                                                                             The techniques envisioned for System M are intended to maximize the             system's performance (given a particular storage environment) by                dynamically placing data on storage media appropriate to their use.             System M will be used to demonstrate empirically the usefulness of              these techniques.  In addition, System M will be useful for empirical           studies of other aspects of transaction processing (e.g., concurrency           controls) on large memories, and as a tool for validation of                    performance models.",
