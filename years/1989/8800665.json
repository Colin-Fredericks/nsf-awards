 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to investigate seasonal fluxes of particulate               matter in the subarctic Pacific where primary productivity is                   relatively high and particle flux appears to be correspondingly                 high.  The amplitude of seasonal material flux is expected to be                large due to significant changes in water column stability                      throughout the seasons.  The high flux values in this region,                   apparently related to characteristics of the ecosystems including               abyssal circulation, are important in material cycles of the                    world's oceans.  This study will involve collaboration with                     Japanese colleagues since they have useful hydrographic,                        nutrient, biological, and other relevant data from the subarctic                Pacific accumulated over the last several decades as well as new                data from their ongoing research programs.  The logistics of                    shiptime provided by Japanese scientists will enable both parties               to conduct a long-term, joint sediment trap program.  Two single                trap mooring systems will be deployed during the summer, 1988,                  one at subarctic Station SA-1 (49.5'N, 175'W) and the other at                  Aleutian Basin Station (AB; 53.5N', 177'W) in the Bering Sea.                   Seasonal trap samples from these two stations will be recovered                 in summer, 1989.  Laboratory analyses of the time-series samples                include organic C, N, H, P. CaCO3, opal, lithogenic matter, and                 an initial listing of planktonic components.  These data will be                related to in-situ hydrographic, nutrient, and biological data as               well as to satellite-derived temperature and chlorophyll data for               synthesis.",
