 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with the restoration of service in a power           system that has lost some or all of its load.  In a blackout or                 brownout situation, the system may separate into separate islands and           it is necessary to first restore the load within the islands and then           restore the interconnections among the islands.  The restoration is             proposed to be done with a hierarchical multi-layer approach                    consisting of a direct control layer, an optimizing layer, and an               adaptive layer.  The focus here is on the last two layers with the              problem formulated as a multi-stage multi-objective sequential                  decision problem.                                                                                                                                               The problem of power system restoration after a blackout is an                  important one but has been very difficult to formulate in a rigorous            mathematical way.  A new formulation is to be developed in this                 approach.  Any success at better restoration techniques will lead to            shorter periods of power outages.",
