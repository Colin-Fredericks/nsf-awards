 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to improve the quality and the quantity of             science taught in K-6 classrooms of Calcasieu Parish in Louisiana.  The         three major components of the project are (1) two semester long                 workshops in the life sciences, earth and space sciences, (2) the               provision of the methodology and motivation for these workshop                  participants to share their expertise with their peers, and (3) the             development of a model by which a local school system can inservice             their teachers.                                                                                                                                                 Both appropriately selected teachers and their principals will be               involved in this three-year long effort.  Teacher teams and                     teacher-principal teams are chosen from among the 36 schools in the             parish.  Each workshop is heavily experiential, inquiry oriented and            offers 6 hours of graduate credit for the teachers. The objectives are          to update and broaden the knowledge of life, earth and space science for        32 K-6 teachers and their principals and to provide the teachers with           the methodology and motivation to improve the science instruction in            their classrooms.  These same 32 teachers have been involved with a             previous project in which their knowledge base in the physical sciences,        physics and chemistry, has been enhanced.  By sequencing this grant with        the previous one, these elementary teachers should be adequately                prepared to effectively teach all of the sciences to their students.            They will also have been involved over a period of several years which          should give them an appropriate background to become the lead teachers          in their schools.  By including the principals in the content portion of        the project as well as the leadership component, strong and                     understanding administrative support for enhancing science instruction          should be forthcoming.  Four full and five half-day inservice days are          built into the school year calendar to implement this peer enhancement.                                                                                         Expert teachers as well as university staff will be involved in                 the instruction.  McNeese State University and the Calcasieu                    Parish Public Schools have contributed an amount equivalent to                  50% of the NSF request.  This is a strong commitment on the part                of the schools and the university and bodes well for continued                  implementation of science education improvement in the                          classrooms.",
