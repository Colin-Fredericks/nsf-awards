 "awd_abstract_narration": "The giant algal Cell, Boergesenia forbesii, will be used to                investigate the molecular and cellular basis of oriented cellulose              microfibril deposition.  Advantages of this model system are:  (a) large        scale cultivation of axenic cultures; (b) the cell responds to wounding         to synchronously form numerous protoplasts; (c) protein synthesis is            initiated, allowing segregation of developmental stages for biochemical         analysis; (d) highly crystalline cellulose microfibril assembly is              initiated by linear aggregation of ordered plasma membrane particles            known as terminal complexes (TCs); and (e) TC size is sufficiently large        for microscopic detection.  Plasma membranes of young protoplasts and           thin walled aplanospores will be purified by advanced biochemical               techniques (including free flow electrophoresis).  Differences in               protein patterns will be correlated with onset of cellulose                     biosynthesis.   Monoclonal antibodies will be produced against purified         plasma membrane proteins.  Due to large TC size, binding antibodies can         be screened using fluorescence microscopy.  Protein will be identified          by western blotting and purified by immunoaffinity columns.  Antibodies         will be used to study TC function in vitro and in vivo.  The antibody           approach leading to identification of proteins in the TC will allow             comparative analysis of TC proteins from other plants, prokaryotes, and         possibly some animals which synthesize cellulose.                                    The question of how cellulosic wall is laid down is one of the most        fundamental, and least well understood, problems in plant biology.  The         question of wall growth is key to problems of plant cell growth and             division, as well as whole-plant development.  The work to be carried           out under this award may also result in advances in our understanding of        cellulose synthesis which may be of commercial significance.",
