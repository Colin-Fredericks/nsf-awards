 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the dramatic developments that have taken place in                      ecology since World War II, the period between the two world wars               is a fascinating subject for historical investigation into                      ecological science.  Many of the approaches later associated with               postwar ecology were introduced during this time, older concepts                were refined and modified, identifiable schools emerged, new                    ecological research institutions came into existence, ecological                theory interacted with social and political views, and ecological               knowledge was applied to a variety of nature conservation and                   preservation issues.  Under this grant, Dr. Cittadino is                        undertaking a thorough investigation into the history of                        ecological science during the 1920s and 1930s from an                           international perspective and with an effort to interrelate                     intellectual, cultural, social, and institutional themes.  He is                examining and synthesizing primary sources, secondary literature                and archival documents.  His goal is to carry out a study which                 provides an accurate assessment of the nature of the ecological                 science during the interwar years and addresses the question of                 the place of ecology in Western science and Western culture                     during this period.",
