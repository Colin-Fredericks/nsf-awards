 "awd_abstract_narration": "Established in May 1986, the present JvNCnet provides high                    bandwidth communications and network services to 23 institutions                using an approximate star topology.  This proposal requests                     continuing support for the JvNCnet in order to take advantage of                recent advances in networking technology which provide a unique                 opportunity for a redesign of both the topolgy and equipment.                   This support will help the JvNCnet achieve higher overall                       performance, improved management, additional growth, and                        substantially lower cost per network connection.                                  This new technolgy will allow the JvNCnet to consist of a                     \"backbone\" and \"local links.\"  The backbone will operate at 1.5                 million bits per second (T-1 speed), and will extend from                       Pennsylvania to Rhode Island through a series of links extending                through telephone company offices in Altoona, PA; Philadelphia,                 PA; Trenton, NJ; Newark, NJ; New York, NY, Stamford, CT; Boston,                MA; and Providence, RI.  A unique feature of the proposal is the                colocation of routers and communications equipment in the central               offices of the long distance carrier.                                             The backbone and local link topolgy permits organized growth of               this regional network in the area of eastern Pennsylvania, the                  State of New Jersey, and the New England States.  New and old                   institutions may be connected to the network at the nearest                     local office of the carrier.  Overall service to users is a                     function of the bandwidth of the local link and the backbone                    which may be upgraded as required.***//",
