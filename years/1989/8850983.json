 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty elementary teachers will gain leadership skills,                         strengthen their science background, and become acquainted with                 the telecommunication technology in a three-week summer 1989                    leadership institute.  The twenty teachers will be selected,                    for the most part, from those who have implemented the School                   Science and Natural History Enrichment Project (SSNHEP) in                      their own classrooms and have an interest in working with their                 peers to expand the program.  This previously funded project                    enabled tachers to implement an environmentally based science                   program in their schools in which they made excellent use of                    local resources, expertise and unique natural phenomena.                                                                                                        This institute will involve principals for the first three days                 of the program in order to build administrative understanding                   and support for an activity-based, outdoor science-oriented                     program.  Teachers and principals will make a team commitment                   to implement the SSHHEP by planning and implementing local                      workshops.  Adequate time for planning and for follow-up                        support of peer teachers who will initiate the program in their                 schools will be contributed by the schools.  During the school                  year, 1989-1990, the twenty lead teachers will plan and                         implement at least two local inservice workshops for at least 6                 teachers each in order to introduce the program in their                        classrooms.                                                                                                                                                     Through private funding, the institute will provide an overview                 of telecommunication as a tool for education and involve                        participating teachers in the development of an instructional                   program for  broadcast during the school year.  Project staff                   will provide resources and consultant assistance to these lead                  teachers during the school year.  The group will reconvene for                  one week in the summer of l990 to review and share the year's                   activities and make plans for continuation.  The long range                     goal of the institute is to identify and motivate potential                     leaders in elementary science education in the state of Maine.                  This collaboration of a professional society, a university                      (College of the Atlantic), school districts, state education                    department and the private sector make this a project worthy of                 possible replication.                                                                                                                                           An amount equal to 30% of the NSF request has been contributed                  by the above collaborators.",
