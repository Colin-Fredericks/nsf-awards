About 60 alumni of the Japan internship programs offered by the            American Electronics Association and Massachusetts Institute of                 Technology will interact with representatives from the U.S. industrial,         government and scientific communities.                                                                                                                          There are numerous barriers to increasing the number of American                scientists/engineers who spend significant periods doing research in            Japanese laboratories, and to the larger U.S. scientific community              obtaining maximum benefit from the Japan-related experiences of                 technologically sophisticated Japan experts.  Objectives of this                conference are:  1) To generate awareness of the value of scientists            and engineers with Japanese language fluencey and knowledge about the           Japanese culture and research environment to U.S. industry; 2) To               inform industry and scientific community that technologically                   sophisticated Japan experts are available and ready to join the ranks           of U.S. companies; and 3) To provide a forum to discuss future                  directions and priorities needed to fully utilize and assure futher             development of the human resources vital to building the U.S.-Japan             relationship.",
