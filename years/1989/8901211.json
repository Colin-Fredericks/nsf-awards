 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Frances Hellman, University of California         at San Diego, for collaborative research with Dr. Ruediger Bormann of           the Institute of Metal Physics, University of Goettingen, Federal               Republic of Germany.  They are interested in ferri-magnetic amorphous           metal alloys derived from rare earth and transition metal elements.             Thin films of these alloys possess a large, poorly-understood uni-              axial magnetic anisotropy, which may be induced in the short-range              order by the growth process.  Certain thermodynamic functions                   control the stability of the amorphous phase relative to the                    crystalline phases of these thin films.  These investigators will               prepare thin film samples of several alloys, differing in composition           or deposition temperature.  They will make extensive thermodynamic              measurements (in Germany), in conjunction with magnetic and structural          characterization (in California), in order to compare the degree and            type of short range order.  Dr. Hellman's background is in thin film            specific heat measurement and in preparation and magnetic and                   structural characterization of amorphous rare earth-transition metal            alloys.  Her German collaborators have unique and extensive experience          in calculations of amorphous and crystalline phase free energies, based         on measurements of certain thermodynamic properties of amorphous                materials (including thin films.)  They also have an ultra-high                 vacuum magnetron sputtering system, dedicated to preparation of high            purity amorphous metallic alloys, especially those containing                   magnetic elements.                                                                                                                                              The question of intermediate and short range order in amorphous                 magnetic materials and their relationship to the magnetic anisotropy            is of basic as well as technological interest.  The difficulty of               making thermodynamic measurements in amorphous thin films has delayed           progress in this area of materials science.  This work should                   contribute to resolving the question of the origin of magnetic                  anisotropy in amorphous films.  It will also help determine the                 conditions leading to phase separation in certain alloys which are              promising magnetic storage materials.",
