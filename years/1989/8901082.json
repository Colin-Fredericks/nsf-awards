 "awd_abstract_narration": "Floral traits may evolve when pollinators select among                     variant forms of flowers.  The behavior of animal pollinators can               directly influence plant fitness through preferential visitation.               Also, the sequence of pollinator visitation to the floral morphs                in part determines gene flow and the mating structure of the                    plant population.  Analysis of pollinator behavior in natural                   populations is complex, as is extrapolation of the implications                 of the behavior for the main-tenance or elimination of the floral               polymorphism, and would be greatly facilitated by an experimental               approach with an uncomplex system.  The behavioral response of                  bee pollinators to a discrete floral pigmentation polymorphism                  found in a natural population of Clarkia gracilis subsp.                        sonomensis will be examined.  The evolutionary implications of                  this response will be investgated; through genetic studies of the               floral poly-morphism, by computer simulation of the interaction                 and resultant changes in floral allele frequencies through time,                and with long-term studies of experimental polymorphic                          populations.  This combined approach, applied to a system with                  discrete variation under simple genetic control, should yield new               insights into plant-pollinator interactions and their                           evolutionary consequences.",
