Research being conducted includes development                                   of reliable methods to concentrate and assay                                    the virus in wastewater during and after                                        stages in its collection, transport and                                         treatment.  Preliminary work has indicated                                      that the HIV is stable in the liquid fraction                                   of non-chlorinated, secondary effluent from a                                   conventional wastewater treatment plant for                                     at least 24 hours with no reduction in                                          infectivity.  In this project, viral                                            concentration will be performed using the                                       bentonite adsorption-elution process with                                       determination of the virus to be conducted by                                   direct assay using the antigen capture test,                                    and by measurement of infectivity.                                                                                                                              The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has                                      been found in body excretions from infected                                     individuals.  Wastes from infected                                              individuals are typically discharged into                                       wastewater collection and treatment systems                                     where the survivability characteristics of                                      the virus are presently not well established.                                   Results of this research are expected to                                        provide the basis for determination of any                                      changes in the engineering design of                                            collection and treatment systems that may be                                    necessary for response to this potential                                        threat to public health.",
