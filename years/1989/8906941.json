 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improved fracture and impact resistance are among the improved                  attributes of fiber reinforced concrete (FRC).  Toughness, which                is a measure of the energy absorption capacity, is used to                      characterize FRC's ability to resist fracture when subjected to                 static, dynamic and impact loads.  The debate on how it is                      measured, interpreted and used is still inconclusive.  The                      objectives of the research program are hence to (a) investigate                 the influence of specimen size, loading configuration, and                      loading rate on the load-deformation characteristics of FRC                     (energy absorption, flexural strength, first-crack strength and                 elastic modulus), (b) evaluate the effectiveness of the currently               used toughness indices and associated specifications, (c) provide               an analytical basis for the interpretation and use of the                       strength and toughness data, and (d) recommend guidelines for the               use of flexural strength and toughness data in specification,                   design and performance evaluation.  The investigation comprises                 experimental and analytical components.  Since the scope of the                 problem is extensive and since statistically significant                        toughness data needs to be generated, an inter-university testing               program involving six universities is included.  As an outcome of               the study, specific recommendations will be made on the use of                  the toughness data in specification, design and performance                     evaluation of fiber cement composites.",
