 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. Michael Jochim, Mr. Herbert Maschner                  will conduct doctoral dissertation research in the Tebenkof Bay                 region of Southeast Alaska.  Previous work by Mr. Maschner has                  indicated the presence of seven archaeological sites, ranging                   from small to large, in this limited area.  The occupants, he                   believes, are directly ancestral to the native American Tlingit                 who occupy the region today.  He shall map all seven sites and                  conduct excavations at four of them.  Preliminary work shows that               all contain house depressions and a series of 1 x 1 meter test                  pits will be dug in a selected sample.  A number of column                      samples will also be collected from midden deposits in front and                behind the houses.  The resulting materials will permit the sites               to be dated and, also, provide information on both social                       organization and diet.  Hopefully, changes in these parameters                  can be traced over time.  The wider region will also be surveyed                for other sites and resource procurement areas will be mapped.                                                                                                  This project is extremely interesting because it will shed light                on the processes which lead to social complexity.  The Tlingit                  developed ranked chiefly societies in prehistoric times and are                 unusual because a hunting and gathering (and not agricultural)                  economy provided a base for this transition.  Theorists disagree                about the processes which underlie this change.  Some argue that                population growth and resultant resource scarcity is the causal                 factor.  Others believe that development of differential access                 to resources is responsible.  Mr. Maschner's research will help                 to select between these two options.                                                                                                                            This research is also important because it will increase our                    understanding of traditional subsistence adaptations in northern                environments.  It may help to formulate policy for present day                  Alaskan aboriginal populations and help determine optimal use of                natural resources.  It will also aid in the training of a                       promising young scientist.",
