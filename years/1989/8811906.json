 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico is a                  100,000 ha transitional area including Great Basin, Great Plains,               Chihuahuan Desert and Mogollon conifer woodland biomes.  Steep                  climatological, elevational, and edaphic gradients within the                   site regulate biotic responses which, in turn, are mediated by                  threshold effects of resource availability.  Consequently, the                  Sevilleta is ideal for studies of biotic responses to climatic                  fluctuation.  This project will support research aimed at                       achieving predictability of ecological change in time and space                 by using experimentation and advanced technology (e.g., remote                  sensing, geographical information systems, LIDAR, FTIR).  Results               will enhance ecological knowledge about; 1) complex processes                   contribution to spatial patterning at the 1-30,000 m scales, 2)                 biotic responses differing among neighboring ecosystem types, 3)                how climatological events originating in the Pacific Ocean modify               local semiarid systems, and 4) the modifying role of animals in                 population and ecosystem responses to fluctuating abiotic                       conditions.  Emphasis is on change in heterogeneous systems and                 the attendant considerations of nonlinearity, threshold effects,                time lags, and the strongly scale-dependent aspects of regulatory               factors.                                                                             In terms of its fundamental worth and meaning the results                  from the project should be important additions to the body of                   ecological knowledge and theory as well as to the better                        management of natural resources and the resolution of global-                   scale ecological concerns, for example climate change.  A major                 strength of the project is the scientific group's aggressive                    attitude toward identifying, testing, adapting, and utilizing                   newly available technologies in an ecological research context.                 This approach should not only provide a productive base within                  the project but also foster on impetus across the entire national               network of Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) projects.                            The research team is excellent, drawing from three academic                institutions, and enjoys the cooperation of the U.S. Fish and                   Wildlife Service (DOI) who are the stewards for the Sevilleta                   site.  Institutional facilities are quite good with major                       additions and improvements planned.  In all, the conditions for                 productive pursuit of this research are highly conducive.                            The Ecosystem Studies Program recommends strongly that six                 years of funding be committed to this worthwhile addition to the                LTER network of projects.",
