 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineers are today faced with unprecedented design challenges and              opportunities involving novel applications and new engineered                   materials.  Often there is only a limited knowledge base available to           guide these designs.  Other than certain specialized concepts from              optimization, a general and useful theoretical framework for design is          lacking.  A rigorous mechanics theory that is capable of identifying            alternative global strategies for a complex problem would be very               useful to design engineers.                                                                                                                                     Some preliminary success had be forthcoming in an attempt to develop            new theory and tools to help engineering discover such global design            strategies.  The design alternatives are generated by seeking a set of          global design modification patterns which induce mutually orthogonal            changes in the system response.  Each orthogonal direction is termed a          canonical design direction.  This proposal requests support to                  continue to test the beams were based on the RITZ method and symbolic           computation (MACSYMA).  A finite element implementation of the method           and explore its use in continuum problem will be developed.  This work          will include investigation of approaches to global optimization,                optimization of topology, and visualization of design/response                  relations.",
