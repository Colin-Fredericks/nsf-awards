 "awd_abstract_narration": "The patterns of water and nitrogen acquisition and utilization by               two species of oaks growing on serpentine-derived soil will be                  investigated.  Preliminary results indicate that Quercus                        agrifolia and Q. durata differ in rooting depth, and that the                   availability of water and nitrogen in the soil varies with both                 depth and season.  It is hypothesized that, as a result of                      spatial interactions between soil resource availability and root                distribution, neighboring individuals of Q. durata and Q.                       agrifolia have access to different levels of nitrogen and water.                It is further predicted that neighboring individuals of the two                 species should differ in the acquisition and utilization of                     nitrogen and water.  These hypotheses will be investigated using                both field and controlled environment studies.  Information on                  rooting depth will be compared with the availability of water and               nitrogen at several depths.  The seasonal patterns of nitrogen                  and water acquisition and utilization for several sets of                       adjacent size matched plants will be followed, and the ways in                  which Q. durata and Q. agrifolia acclimate to nitrogen and water                availability will be investigated by growing plants under                       nutrient sand-culture conditions designed to simulate the                       resources available to shallowly and deeply rooted plants.",
