 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to process and interpret a suite of               large-offset seismic profiles collected in the Victoria Land                    Basin (VLB) of the Ross Sea using an airgun array as a source and               ocean bottom seiemometers as receivers.  This experiment is part                of an onshore-offshore experiment to study the deep structure of                the VLB/Transantarctic Mountain system.  Partial logistical                     support has been provided by the German Antarctic North Victoria                Land Experiment (GANOVEX V).  Multichannel seismic reflection                   data show that the VLB is a deep (at least 10km) basin that began               forming by extension in the Late Cretaceous or Early Cenzoic.                   That it is still active today is indicated by the presence of                   active volcanoes where the basin intersects the coast and by many               short-wavelength, high-amplitude offshore magnetic features                     interpreted to be volcanos and subseafloor intrusions.  Extension               of the VLB has been accompanied by rapid coeval uplift of the                   adjacent Transantarctic Mountains.  Deep crustal information from               rift zones, such as the VLB, is needed to quantify the volume of                melt associated with rifting and its relationship to pre-rift                   tectonic history, large-scale plate tectonic setting, and rifting               age.",
