 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Floyd plans to work in geometric group theory                    and topology.  In an attempt to make some progress on the                       geometric group theory of nonpositively curved manifolds, he                    plans to study graph amalgamation products of finite groups                     over finite graphs.  This will be joint work with Walter Parry.                  He intends to continue his research on the growth functions of                 hyperbolic groups and make the computer a more effective tool                   for studying growth functions.  His other research topic is a                   joint project with Edwin E. Floyd on constructing (and                          computing the homology of) classifying spaces of finite groups                  via their Euclidean actions.                                                         Professor Quinn plans to work in geometric topology, and                   related topics in algebra and geometry.  Specifically he plans                  to complete the development of controlled versions of K- and                    L-theory.  This is expected to yield information about assembly                 maps from homology groups to K- and L- groups.  In turn this                    should allow further computations of K- and L- groups of                        infinite groups with torsion, especially discrete subgroups of                  Lie groups.  It should also shed light on the topological                       structure of stratified spaces, like algebraic varieties and                    quotients of group actions.                                                          In short, Floyd and Quinn are investigating the                            fundamental structure of geometric objects known as manifolds                   (spheres, toruses, and other more highly connected objects) as                  well as their symmetry properties, which can be described                       algebraically by groups.",
