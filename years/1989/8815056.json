 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Elliot Bernstein is supported by a grant from The                        Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to investigate reaction                 intermediates isolated in very cold molecular clusters.  This                   research is of fundamental importance in assessing the                          influence which various solvents have on reacting solutes                       during a chemical reaction.                                                                                                                                        Bimolecular chemical reactions in isolated van der Waals                     clusters will be studied using time of flight mass                              spectroscopy, fluorescence excitation, dispersed emission, and                  phosphorescence excitation techniques.  The reactions of                        interest are photoinduced and can be classified as: 1) solvent                  assisted and stabilized electron transfer, 2) addition to                       substituted ethylenes, and 3) aromatic ring substitutions.                      Nanosecond time resolved experiments will be performed to                       determine cluster structure and energy levels, to identify the                  potentially reactive systems, and to characterize the product                   and transition state systems.  Cluster reaction dynamics will                   be investigated through picosecond time correlated single                       photon counting and various two color pump/probe techniques.                    Theoretical studies of these cluster reactions will involve an                  extension of the RRKM calculations which Bernstein has                          previously applied to bimolecular cluster reactions.",
