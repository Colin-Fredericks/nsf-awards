 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Rosenthal and Odell will work on a variety of                   problems in the theory of Banach spaces. One central problem                    concerns identifying the complemented subspaces of the space                    of absolutely integrable functions on an interval. This is                      related to the structure of Banach spaces and convex sets failing               the Radon-Nikodym property. The question of the existence of                    subspaces isomorphic to the space of null or absolutely summable                sequences in a hereditarily non-reflexive Banach space will be                  pursued. The approach Rosenthal and Odell will use involves                     analysis of the structure of spaces of Baire functions. Their                   recently invented notion of governance of a class of Banach                     spaces by a function will also play an important role.                               The theory of Banach spaces is about analysis in infinitely                many dimensions. For each finite dimension n, there is only one                 n-dimensional space, in most respects as well understood in                     general as in the familiar cases when n is 1, 2, or 3. These are                used to keep track of situations in which there are only finitely               many degrees of freedom. When the number of degrees of freedom                  becomes infinite, as would for instance be necessary to describe                the configuration of a piece of string, there are many possible                 reasonable choices for the ambient space in which to perform                    analysis. The work supported by this award is largely concerned                 with the ways in which these spaces fit into another, a line of                 investigation that lays bare a good deal of their structure.",
