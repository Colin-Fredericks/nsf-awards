 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kentucky high school students with high ability-high potential, who have        taken biology and chemistry (10th or 11th graders), will be participants        (20 per year) in a five-week summer project at Western Kentucky                 University, Department of Biology which initiates a research experience         in molecular biology for the following year.                                    The goals and objectives are:  (1) to increase the number and nature of         educational experiences for the participants, teach scientific                  approaches and research methodologies employed in molecular biology; (2)        to provide career testing, counseling, planning and information on              sources of financial aid and scholarships; (3) to give participants             \"hands on\" experiences in defining research questions, designing                experiments with controls, collecting data, forming conclusions and             communicating results.                                                                                                                                          Attendees will be divided into four groups.  Members of these groups            will each undertake research projects with one staff member throughout          the five-week summer period.  Each group will also rotate for one-half          day for one week into each of the staff members' research laboratories.         Research activities will focus on several molecular approaches                  including; DNA replication, molecular virology and DNA sequencing,              eukaryotic cell structure and function and the effects of metals on             enzyme activity.  Students will be exposed to career development                activities and be involved in discussions concerning morals and ethics          in science.  Research activities will continue through the academic year        that the participants high school in a follow up program involving the          research staff.",
