 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will analyze the problem of                     existence and regularity of holomorphic embeddings of certain CR                manifolds of real hypersurface type.  These are manifolds having                the same internal structure as is induced on the boundary of a                  smooth, strongly pseudoconvex domain in complex Euclidean space.                Key elements of the method to be applied are Henkin's solution                  operators for the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations.  For the                 local problem he will improve previous estimates and reduce, as                 much as possible, the considerable derivative loss in his                       existing arguments.  The problem of global embeddings will be                   further analyzed.  The study will lead to a deeper understanding                of the concept of boundary of a complex manifold and of                         properties of certain over-determined systems of linear, first                  order, partial differential equations.                                               An endless curve in the plane which wraps up on itself is an               example of an immersion of the real line which is not an                        embedding.  An embedding always manages to steer clear of itself.               Holomorphic embeddings require that the function, which injects                 the curve or surface into the target manifold, be smooth in the                 complex analytic sense.  Theorems from the study of CR or complex               analytic manifolds have always seemed miraculous by the standards               of traditional real analysis.  The results to be completed by                   this project will be no different.",
