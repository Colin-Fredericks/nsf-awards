 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Cozzens, working with Dr. Iskender Gokalp, a physical                       scientist at the CNRS in France, are investigating the context                  and impact of the introduction of laser doppler anemometry (LDA)                into the domains of turbulence and turbulent combustion studies.                The case is significant for a number of reasons.  The domain is                 an important one with strong technological and social                           consequences.  It is an example of an interdisciplinary field                   with strong interactions between different contributing areas.                  The changes introduced by LDA are drastic, and thus create an                   opportunity to compare revolutionary and evolutionary changes in                the field.  the pure turbulence and turbulent combustion research               communities received LDA differently, with one incorporating it                 immediately and the other resisting for some time.  The contrast                provides a natural comparative design for studying the factors                  that facilitate and inhibit diffusion of instruments.  LDA was                  introduced in a highly competitive domain with strong                           technological potentialities.  The case also allows the                         investigators to compare the response of different national                     systems to changes with practical consequences.  Finally, it is a               recent case which makes it relatively convenient to study.                                                                                                      Drs. Gokalp and Cozzens are exploring the case on a collaborative               basis through analysis of documents, interviews and site visits.                A portion of the research builds a data base on the process                     through which laboratories introduced LDA.  Another analyzes                    LDA's impact on the field of turbulent combustion itself.  A                    third involves case studies of individual laboratories, to                      explore in more depth the process of incorporation of the                       instrument.",
