 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to produce transgenic plants in the laboratory has                  expanded significantly since 1983, the date of the first                        successful production of a model transgenic plant.  Transgenic                  plants have been produced for many food and feed plants, e.g.,                  alfalfa, canola, potato, rice, soybean and tomato, and within the               next few years are expected for most food and feed plants.                      Substantial scientific discussion has occurred with respect to                  the agricultural and environmental risks of field introduction of               genetically-engineered plants for research and commercial                       production.                                                                                                                                                     The purpose of this workshop is to examine scientific issues in                 the regulation of genetically-engineered plants used for human                  food and animal feed, especially that class of near-term                        applications involving genetically-engineered plants in which                   small (single or a few) well-characterized gene changes have been               made to introduce new proteins.  The goals of the workshop are:                 (1) to reach a consensus on what can be reasonably concluded                    about food safety and risk, given the current state of knowledge;               (2) to identify what needs to be known about the specific                       applications so that credible regulatory decisions can be made;                 and (3) to develop recommendations on how research need can be                  fulfilled.",
