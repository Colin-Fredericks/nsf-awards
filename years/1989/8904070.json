Such knowledge is needed to understand volcanic eruptions and the               formation and evolution of magmas and ores.  This project will                  determine the vesicularity and crystal content of individual                    lumps of pumice as well as the compositions of phenocrysts and                  concentrations of H2O and CO2 in glassy and revitrified                         inclusions in quartz and feldspar phenocrysts from                              stratigraphically controlled sites in the rhyolitic Bishop Tuff,                Calif.  These determinations will be used to assess the following               postulates:  1) An accumulation of gas existed in the upper part                of the preerupted body of magma; 2) Gas accumulation was mostly                 responsible for a strong upward decrease in bulk magma density                  and consequent prevention of convection and survival of magmatic                zoning during eruption; 3) the transition from plinian to ash-                  flow style of eruption corresponds to a sharp change in the                     amount of accumulated gas; 4) gas accumulation largely derived                  from deeper levels of differentiation rather than in situ                       crystallization; 5) H2O was added to magma during ascent.",
