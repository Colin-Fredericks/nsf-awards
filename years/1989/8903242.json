 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central focus of this mathematical research concerns                   problems in complex function theory and quasiconformal mappings.                One of the primary objectives of the work is that of classifying                certain groups of homeomorphisms of Euclidean space.  Among the                 best understood groups are the so-called Mobius groups, those                   groups whose elements are represented by simplest linear                        (fractional) transformations.  The classification problem is one                of determining which other groups are topologically conjugate to                a Mobius group  and to understand what the obstruction is that                  might prevent such a group isomorphism. Among the target groups                 is one known as the convergence group which has many properties                 of groups of quasiconformal mappings.  Many convergence groups                  are known to be conjugate to Mobius groups, but to date, no                     complete classification has been found.  Work will be done in an                effort to determine the extent to which these groups all enjoy                  the same properties relative to Mobius groups.                                       A second line of investigation concerns injectivity criteria               for locally univalent functions.  This work seeks conditions                    which guarantee the extension of locally univalent meromorphic                  mappings from neighborhoods of a domain to a quasiconformal map                 of the entire complex plane.  The extension is to be carried so                 that the complex dilatation remains bounded by a fixed amount.                  There is a sizeable literature concerning questions of this type.               One specific objective of this work is to remove the condition                  that the meromorphic function be holomorphic in a neighborhood of               a domain and only assume this property within a closed domain.                  If one drops the condition that the initial function be                         meromorphic, then the extension problem becomes too general.                    However, a natural condition on the cross-ratio of a complex                    function within a disc leads to a more restrictive class where                  quasiconformal extensions (the injectivity problem) have been                   shown to exist.                                                                      Work will continue in determining precise conditions on                    cross-ratios which will guarantee injectivity.           //",
