 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Berkson will continue his work of recent years on                the development, from the viewpoint of transference methods, of a               unified abstract operator theory designed to treat the diversity                of decompositions arising in general harmonic analysis. Specific                objectives include: expansion of transference theory in regard to               weak type and strong type bounds for maximal operators; the                     development of transference estimates tailored to specific                      classes of spaces; Fourier multiplier extension theorems;                       investigation of transference by unbounded representations and                  its relationship to weighted norm inequalities; and the                         decomposition of UMD spaces under the action of a locally compact               abelian group.                                                                       The mathematical framework for this project is harmonic                    analysis, which may be thought of as theoretical signal-                        processing. The classic strategy, invented by Fourier for                       periodic signals, is to decompose into pure tones, multiples of                 some unit frequency. This gives a list of numbers which can then                be manipulated and turned back into a modified signal. Sometimes                the classic strategy is not the most apt, and it becomes                        preferable to use some other decomposition that is less                         straightforward mathematically. Professor Berkson's work is aimed               at better understanding of a wide variety of strategies for                     performing harmonic analysis.",
