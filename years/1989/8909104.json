 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microcellular foam refers to plastics with closed cells on                 the order of 10 micrometer in diameter.  A remarkable new foam                  material has recently been produced by using carbon dioxide to                  foam a physic known as PET.  The resulting foam possesses high                  strength, stiffness, and toughness, and may open the way for use                of microcellular foams in load-bearing applications.                                 The goal of this research is to synthesize a novel                         manufacturing process to produce microcellular PET parts, by                    defining the conditions under which the polymer must be                         processed.  Deformation in the foaming cycle will be integrated                 such that three dimensional parts may be produced while                         preserving the fragile microstructure.  The basic idea is to seek               a processing strategy that uncouples the deformation process from               the cell nucleation and the polymer crystallization processes.                       The unique role of carbon dioxide in inducing                              crystallization in PET during the foaming process will be studied               using the electron microscopy techniques.  Differential Thermal                 Analysis will be used to determine the extent of crystallization                as a function of gas concentration.  The extent of coupling                     between the process functional requirements will be studied                     experimentally.  Finally, an uncoupled process that will allow                  independent control of microstructure (average cell size and                    density), degree of crystallinity in the foam, and the part                     geometry, will be synthesized.",
