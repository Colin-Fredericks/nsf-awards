 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is enormous diversity in every aspect of animal life                 histories, including the age at maturity, frequency of                          reproduction, number and size of offspring, and the effort                      invested by parents in individual offspring.  What factors in the               environment selected for these differences among and within                     species?  The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the                  role of specific environmental influences on life history                       evolution of natural populations of guppies on the island of                    Trinidad.  Natural populations of guppies from the Northern Range               of Trinidad have life history differences associated with                       differences in predation.  Guppies that co-occur with the pike                  cichlid Crenicichla alta and other predators mature at an earlier               age, devote more of their available resources to reproduction,                  and tend to produce more and smaller offspring than guppies that                co-occur with just the killifish Rivulus harti.  Crenicichla and                some of the associated species of predators prey predominantly on               large, sexually mature size classes of guppies.  Rivulus prey                   predominantly on small, immature size classes of guppies.  The                  size specificity of these predators suggests that they select for               life history changes by altering the age-specific survival of                   guppies.  By preying on large guppies, Crenicichla should reduce                adult survival.  By preying on small guppies, Rivulus should                    reduce juvenile survival.  The influence of such differences in                 age-specific survival on life history evolution has been                        investigated theoretically; the predicted responses in life                     history evolution correspond precisely with the differences                     observed between Crenicichla and Rivulus localities.  The key                   field experiments in the proposed research involve introducing                  guppies and guppy predators into sections of stream where they                  had previously been excluded by waterfalls.  The effects of                     predators and the environment, most notably resource                            availability, will be evaluated with direct observations of                     growth and survival, plus indirect estimates of growth and                      survival using otolith.  Otolith are bone-like structures in the                inner ear which record daily rings, similar to the annual rings                 commonly seen in cross-sections of tree trunks.",
