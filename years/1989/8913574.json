The purpose of this Seminar is to provide                                       state-of-the-art data and analysis results                                      from recent research studies of earthquake                                      strong-motion data: these data were collected                                   by the California Strong-Motion                                                 Instrumentation Program (SMIP).  The workshop                                   agenda includes discussions of earthquake                                       ground motion data as well as data from                                         instrumented buildings, bridges, and dams                                       subjected to these ground motions.                                                                                                                              On the following day, May 10 1989, the                                          California Division of Mines and Geology is                                     holding a one-day workshop to (1) identify                                      the most meaningful seismological and                                           engineering implications of recent strong-                                      motion data, and (2) to develop a research                                      agenda for the next series of SMIP research                                     awards.  The participants include Seminar                                       paper authors, members of the SMIP Advisory                                     Panels, and 10 invited participants.
