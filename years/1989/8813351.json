 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor George Fai of the Department of                   Physics, Kent State University, and Dr. Joergen Randrup of the                  Nuclear Science Division of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, in a                  research collaboration with Professors Laszlo P. Csernai and Jan                S. Vaagen, of the Physics Department, University of Bergen,                     Norway.  The general aim of their research is to achieve a                      theoretical understanding of relativistic nuclear collisions,                   with emphasis on the general properties of excited nuclear                      matter and possible phase transitions.  They will carry out                     several closely related theoretical investigations of the                       collective properties of nuclear matter as they appear in                       relativistic heavy ion collisions.  More specifically, they are                 seeking to improve realistic microcanonical simulation models of                nuclear disassembly by including the attractive nuclear                         interactions and Coulomb interactions among the fragments.  They                will also study the dynamics of intermediate energy heavy ion                   collisions via classical simulation models, the properties of                   collective transverse flow and the dynamics of final                            fragmentation.  In addition, they are interested in the dynamics                of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions and of quark-gluon                      plasma (QGP) formation.  These and other types of models will be                used to examine the properties of nuclear matter at two basic                   energy regions:  the highest energies now under experimental                    investigation at CERN and Brookhaven National Laboratory, and                   intermediate energy reactions where nuclear multifragmentation                  and liquid-vapor phase transition can be studied.  The U.S.                     investigators have developed one of the most detailed                           statistical fragmentation models at medium energies and will                    provide expertise in this area, while the Norwegian participants                have worked in fluid dynamics at several energies and also bring                expertise related to nucleus-nucleus interaction at low energy.                                                                                                 Advances in the field of nuclear physics are made possible by                   the continuing interaction between theory and experiment.  The                  theoretical results of this collaboration will provide useful                   tools for analyzing experimental data and designing new                         experiments.  Since statistical methods are used extensively,                   the research can provide insight in the statistics of small                     systems, using nuclei as a proving ground.",
