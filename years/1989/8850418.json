 "awd_abstract_narration": "A science curriculum package (K-3) written by an Elementary Specialists         committee and expert instructors from the university as well as the             school levels will serve as the guide for a comprehensive academic year         ten-session workshop for 60 elementary teachers in the Minneapolis area.        This will give them a basic knowledge of science content and show them          how to integrate materials into their existing curriculum.  The                 curriculum materials based primarily on existing good packages, such as         ESS, SCIS, units developed by some of the Minnesota school districts as         well as from England and New Zealand will be reviewed by four                   Presidential Awardees for Excellence in Science Teaching who will               oversee the project and serve as subject specialists.                                                                                                           The participating teachers will use the material in their own                   classrooms and share their results with colleagues.  This sharing is            formally built into the workshop in two ways, (1) at the beginning of           each session, the teachers will report back to their fellow participants        and (2) two follow-up workshops/year for three years will be held during        the fall and spring meetings of the Minnesota Science Teachers.                                                                                                 A similar format is being set up for the teachers of grades 4-6 to be           held during year two of his project.  Elementary teachers will meet to          assess the impact of the workshop and to finalize                               the curriculum package.  It will then be distributed to                         elementary teachers by means of further inservice workshops held                by the elementary and subject specialists and workshop                          participants.                                                                                                                                                   An amount equivalent to 50% of the requested funding is being                   cost-shared by the University of Minnesota, St. Cloud University,               local school districts and each of the individual instructors                   involved in the project.",
