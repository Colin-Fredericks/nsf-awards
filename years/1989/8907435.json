 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will analyse the dynamics of                    topological defects in solutions of nonlinear field equations.                  These problems arise naturally in various physical contexts.                    In particular, vortex dynamics in superconductors, spiral waves                 in reaction-diffusion processes, grain boundaries and                           dislocation defects in models of convection, and the dynamics                   of topological singularities in nonlinear hyperbolic field                      theories of modern physics will be examined.                                         The methodology to be employed is that of multiple-scale                   analysis which exploits the separaton of spatial scales                         multiple-scale analysis which that are instrinsic to these                      problems:  the distance between defects is taken as large                       compared to their effective radii. This methodology has been                    successfully applied to the two-dimensional nonlinear                           Schroedinger equation, nonlinear heat equation, and nonlinear                   wave equation, and it is clear that their scope is sufficient                   to lead to new and useful insights in the physical problems to                  be studied in this project.",
