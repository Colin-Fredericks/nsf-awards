 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new technique for mobile robot navigation and control has                     recently been investigated.  The technique uses a wide angle                    lens to image specified targets and uses image detection and                    recognition to determine the position of the robot with respect                 to the targets thus providing a basis for navigation control.                   This sensor may also be used alone or with other sensors to                     provide obstacle avoidance for stationary or moving objects.                    The higher level problems of path following and region filling                  are also included in this research in a hierarchical control                    structure.  For unstructured and changing environments, the                     navigation control problem is crucial.  This research is                        directed toward the vision control problem.  In particular, a                   high speed vision tracking method is proposed for this                          research.  A hardware architecture using binary image                           processing with multiple data and processing paths will be                      investigated.  In this manner, we hope to achieve vision                        tracking rates which will permit a vision based controller to                   be used for a wide variety of mobile robots.",
