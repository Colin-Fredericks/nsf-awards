 "awd_abstract_narration": "A composite allochthonous super terrane now constitutes much               of western Washington, British Columbia and southern Alaska.                    Paleomagnetic and paleobiologic data suggest that the western                   part of this terrane was assembled in equatorial latitudes and                  that during Late Cretaceous - early Tertiary time the composite                 terrane moved northward toward its present position along the                   western margin of North America.  Several hypotheses concerning                 the tectonics of final emplacement will be tested in this study.                These are that Late Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous deformation                 within the terrane was a response to sinistral oblique conver-                  gence, that early to mid-Cretaceous deformation was dominantly                  convergent and that the onset of dextral transcurrent deforma-                  tion began in late Cenomanian time.  Strata of the Middle                       Jurassic to late Cretaceous Tyaughton basin should record these                 postulated events in faults of small displacement.  This study                  will determine the paleo-stress by analysis of macro and micro                  structural data from younger units and subtracting results from                 successively older units.  By this back-stripping, a history of                 paleostress will be obtained that will allow hypotheses to be                   tested.",
