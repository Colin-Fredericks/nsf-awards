 "awd_abstract_narration": "A joint program of work is proposed between Florida Atlantic                    University and Carnegie-Mellon University to develop an                         underwater three dimensional vision system for intelligent                      autonomous underwater vehicles.  The main thrust of the work will               be in the development of algorithms for the processing of the                   signal from a multiple element SONAR array to generate a grid                   representation of the ocean bottom terrain and the development of               map building algorithms to generate a coherent map of the terrain               and use the representation for navigation, object recognition and               classification, and path planning.  The present types of SONAR                  systems in general generate two dimensional information or if                   three dimensional information is generated, the resolution is                   rather poor.  Thus, an innovative SONAR system is to be developed               that differs from other SONAR systems its in its mode of                        operation, relying more on data processing which will allow                     the extraction of three dimensional information with high                       resolution and with a refresh rate controlled only by the speed                 of the processing unit. The basic approach of the signal                        processing consists of multi-dimensional discrete Fourier                       transforms, in time and space, of the acoustic signals received                 by the multi-element receiver array of the SONAR system.  The                   processing will first generate angle-angle-range data which is                  then converted to a discrete representation of the ocean bottom                 terrain. The main tasks of the map building process will be the                 data handling and the matching of data structures acquired from                 different vehicle locations and orientations relative to the                    terrain and the extraction of high level features such as object                location, object type an topographical information.  The result                 is a high level three dimensional world model image required to                 support underwater surveying and sensor based navigation.",
