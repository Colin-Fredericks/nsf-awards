 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on a subset of large-scale organizations                  using highly technical systems known as \"high reliability                       organizations\" (HROs) -- those whose operating failures could be                extremely harmful to large segments of the population.  Among the               questions addressed are these: what patterns of formal                          organization and formal rules develop                                           in response to the pressures for highly reliable performance;                   what are the corresponding decision making and vertical versus                  horizontal communication patterns, and the components of                        'organizational culture' of high reliability?  How is the                       introduction of new technologies accomplished in such                           organizations?   This project has undertaken a comparative                      study of three organizations whose performances often                           surpasses expectations for very reliable performance: the                       FAA's Air Traffic Control System, the Electric Operations                       department of a Pacific utility company and two nuclear                         aircraft carriers.  This grant will facilitate observational                    visits, questionnaires, interviews and the collection of                        performance data in the first two sites, since data collection                  on the third site has largely been completed.",
