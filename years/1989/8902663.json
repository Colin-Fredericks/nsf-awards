A procedure is introduced and will be                    examined in light of efficiency and applicability for finding                   all the isolated zeros of deficient polynomial systems which                    need to be solved repetitively with varying coefficients. The                   procedure is based on the cheater's homotopy, a continuation                    method which follows paths to all solutions.  All solutions are                 found with an amount of computational work roughly proportional                 to the actual number of solutions, while previous general                       methods normally require an amount of computation roughly                       proportional to the total degree.                                                                                                                               The research will further investigate the structure of the                      deficiency on a case-by-case basis.  The main concern is, in a                  specific case, to find an initial polynomial system for the                     homotopy that is simple to solve and also produces few                          extraneous homotopy paths.",
