The         broad purpose of this type of award is to enable promising female               scholars the opportunity to increase their research productivity and to         contribute to their respective disciplines.  With this award, the               investigator will develop expertise in and carry out a study of weapons         procurement.  The central question of this research concerns the                production of workable weapons systems and the technology that is               needed to produce them.  The political science contribution concerns            an evaluation of the relation between military needs and the production         of workable systems.  This Career Advance Award will provide release            time for the principal investigator and allow her to do the requisite           background research for the study.  The award will also enable the              investigator to gain the technical skills necessary to undertake this           stream of research.",
