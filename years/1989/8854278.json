 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-week workshop is enhancing the ability of faculty in                  undergraduate computer science programs to develop and teach courses in         the areas of systems programming, computer operating systems, computer          networking and computer architecture.  In particular, the workshop is           aimed at: increasing faculty members' knowledge of both the                     characteristics of the hardware components and the interaction among            these components within a computer system, and developing effective             techniques for transmitting this knowledge and understanding to                 students.  Faculty participating in the workshop are primarily involved         in the design and implementation of laboratory experiments which                illustrate many of the basic principles of integrating the components           of a microprocessor-based computer system.  For example, experiments            are being developed to illustrate the capabilities and limitations of           various microprocessors, the different memory mapping schemes,                  interrupt handling techniques, and a variety of peripheral interfaces.          Workshop participants are also discussing the integration of these              laboratory experiments into their computer software systems curricula.          Detailed descriptions of the experiments developed through this                 workshop will be disseminated to the academic computer science                  community.",
