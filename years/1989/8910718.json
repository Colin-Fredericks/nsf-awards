 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to conduct systematic                         engineering studies on the growth kinetics, morphology,                         stability, gene expression, and secretion in recombinant                        filamentous fungi.  A recombinant Aspergillus nidulans strain                                                                                                   has been chosen as a first system for study.  It carries a                      glucoamylase gene under the control of the strong inducible                     promoter of the A. nidulans alcohol dehydrogenase I (alcA)                      gene.  The cloned product, glucoamylase, is secreted into the                                                                                                   medium.  The alcA promoter is activated in the presence of                      various compounds including ethanol, cyclic alcohols, and                       threonine, and is subject to carbon catabolite repression.                      Glucoamylase expression levels can be regulated by a                            combination of induction-repression conditions.  Experiments                    will be conducted with both host and recombinant cells to                       provide a quantitative description of the growth dynamics of                    recombinant fungal cells in terms of growth rates, nutrient                     yields, production rates, secretion efficiencies,                               productivities, and stabilities.  This information can be used                                                                                                                                                                                  in the future to build a mathematical model of fungal growth                    dynamics, necessary in the engineering design and development                                                                                                   of operational strategies for bioreactors used in the                           production of recombinant proteins from filamentous fungi.",
