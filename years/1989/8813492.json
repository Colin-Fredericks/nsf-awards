 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor A. W. Castleman, Jr., of the                      Pennsylvania State University, for continued collaboration with                 Professor T. D. Maerk of the University of Innsbruck, Austria, to               enhance his ongoing domestic research in chemical physics.  These               investigators share an interest in understanding the formation and              chemistry of aerosols in the atmosphere.  The focus of their                    collaboration is a study of the production, stability and reactivity            of cluster ions of a wide variety of chemical systems produced by               various techniques.  The Austrian experiment uses electron impact               ionization to produce cluster ions and can identify sequential decay            processes, while the American lab uses photoionization and can                  investigate dissociation over a longer time.  The American group                employs time-of-flight mass spectrometric techniques, while the                 Austrian group uses a double focussing sector field mass spectrometer           to study similar phenomena.  The techniques are complementary and               furnish different capabilities that result in a more complete                   description of the processes under consideration.                                                                                                               Gas phase clusters comprised of weakly bound aggregates of either               atoms and/or molecules often display properties that lie between the            gas and condensed state.  Studies of clusters are not only of value             in terms of bridging the gas and condensed phase, but are also                  interesting since they comprise a new state of matter in which there            is intense and growing interest from a fundamental point of view.               Furthermore, they are also important due to their potential role in             many fields of application and technology.  This new and rapidly                growing field requires and benefits from the application of a wide              variety of experimental tools and the interaction of scientists                 coming from different disciplines.  The proposed collaboration                  provides unique opportunities in both regards, as amply demonstrated            by the productivity of their previous collaboration.",
