 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award for a National Center for Geographic                            Information and Analysis (NCGIA) is made to a consortium                        consisting of the University of California at Santa Barbara,                    the State University of New York at Buffalo, and the                            University of Maine at Orono.                                                        NCGIA research will advance the theory, methods, and                       techniques of geographic information analysis (GIA) based on                    geographic information systems (GIS).  Three impediments                        hamper more effective GIS-based analysis: deficient                             capabilities for data-handling, insufficient analysis and                       modeling capabilities, and meager understanding of                              applicability and user acceptance.  Research addressing such                    impediments will at the outset focus on the accuracy of                         spatial data bases, languages of spatial relations, scale                       dependence in representations of cartographic features, and                     the value of geographic information in decisionmaking.                          Additional initiatives will evolve from the first four.                              The NCGIA will augment the nation's supply of experts in                   GIS and geographical analysis by offering educational programs                  will increase the quantity and quality of GIA/GIS degrees.                      Graduate, junior faculty, and postdoctoral fellowships will                     channel students into academic careers.  The NCGIA will create                  curricula and conduct summer institutes to upgrade GIA/GIS                      instruction nationwide.                                                              The NCGIA will act as a central clearinghouse for                          disseminating information regarding research, teaching, and                     applications in GIS and related fields.  NCGIA will promote                     the diffusion of analysis based on GIS throughout the                           scientific community.  Consortium faculty now conduct                           collaborative research with government agencies and the                         private sector.  The consortium will expand current                             collaboration into a comprehensive outreach program that will                   match NSF funds with government and industrial support for                      cooperative work on problems of common interest.  Workshops,                    seminars, conferences and a publication series will                             disseminate NCGIA findings.                                                          Science and society require information systems that can                   accommodate exceedingly large spatially-referenced data bases                   to support analysis and modeling of complex spatial phenomena.                  Geographic information systems can perform logical,                             statistical, and mathematical operations on maps.  Information                  from different sources can be brought to a common projection                    and scale, analyzed, and displayed far more readily than is                     possible with hard copy maps.  The NCGIA will narrow gaps                       among theory, technology, and applications in GIA/GIS in the                    engineering, natural, and social sciences.  It will ensure                      that the nation's needs to capture, process and analyze                         geographic data in support of scientific research,                              environmental analysis, and civil administration are well met                   during the remainder of the century.",
