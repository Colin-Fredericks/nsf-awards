Stereochemical control               over carbon-carbon bond forming processes remains one of the                    outstanding challenges in modern synthetic organic chemistry.  The              addition reactions of oxiranes are especially promising candidates              for the development of new methods for carbon framework                         construction because they offer the potential of establishing                   multiple chiral centers per single skeletal elaboration step.  The              researchers intend to pursue three main objectives:  1) to develop              novel methods for the electrophile-promoted addition of                         carbon-nucleophiles to oxiranes; 2) to define the scope and                     potential synthetic utility of these methods; and 3) to develop a               concise synthetic approach that should be useful in the total                   synthesis of selected cyclodepsipeptide antibiotics.                                                                                                            The proposed work is mutually beneficial with the Italian side                  contributing a more mechanistic viewpoint while the U.S. side                   provides the synthetic approach.  Recent work by the collaborators              has provided some very encouraging results.  Application to a                   medically useful class of compounds is one of the potential                     benefits from the project.",
