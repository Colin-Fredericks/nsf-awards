 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to analyze an extensive ocean bottom                         seismometer data set collected in 1986 by US and Canadian                       government agencies and universities in the Great Lakes.  The                   project was designed to image the crustal structure associated                  with the Midcontinent Rift and Grenville Front as part of the                   GLIMPCE project.  The method of analysis is an innovative 2D ray-               tracing and single shot migration of the seismic data.                          Increasing our understanding of the midcontinental rift is an                   important scientific goal that will help to explain the mechanism               of rifting and associated crustal thinning.  The results may also               bear on the difficult problem if intraplate tectonic activity                   that is the cause of earthquakes outside from crustal plate                     boundary zones and thus the work is a contribution to the                       National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.",
