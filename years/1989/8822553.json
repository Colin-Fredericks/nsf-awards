 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is made up of two major scientific                   missions:  1)  The completion of the CUSB-II Upsilon                            Spectroscopy studies at Cornell Electron Storage Ring                           accelerator, CESR.  2)  Complete construction and begin data                    taking with the D0 detector at Fermilab.                                             This group, in collaboration (CUSB-II) with a group from                   Columbia University, have been the world leaders in studies of                  atoms (upsilon) made up of a \"b quark\" and an \"anti b quark\".                   The b quark is the heaviest quark known and is approximately                    five times as heavy as the proton.  Studies of these \"atoms\"                    provide detailed information about the strong forces between b                  quarks.                                                                              The D0 experiment is a large collaborative effort amongst                  more than twenty institutions working together at Fermilab.                     The research activity is the development, and use in physics                    measurements, of a particle detector system for the D0                          intersection region of the proton-antiproton collider at                        Fermilab.  This detector system is expected to be one of the                    most important instruments for elementary particle physics                      research during the next decade.                                                     The DO detector will be used to measure the properties of                  the \"weak bosons\", carriers of the weak nuclear force; study                    the properties of the strong nuclear force (quantum                             chromodynamics); and search for yet undiscovered phenomena.                          The field of research is that of experimental elementary                   particle physics.  This research studies the basic building                     blocks of matter (e.g., electrons, positrons, quarks, and weak                  bosons) at very high energies.  The experiments use                             accelerators (colliders) which provide the highest energy                       particles made in the laboratory.  The data is collected and                    analyzed using highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and                   techniques.",
