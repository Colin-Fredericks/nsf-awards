 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze three related issues in               international macroeconomics that bear on the fluctuations and                  long term interdependence of developed economies.  The first                    issue concerns the international transmission of the business                   cycle.  The analysis builds on previous research in which                       international fluctuations were driven by changes in                            international productivity.  This aspect of the project will                    involve measuring productivity changes more accurately, which                   will help to shed light on the nature of productivity changes and               their impact on the business cycle.   The second issue concerns a               striking anomaly within the existing theoretical framework: the                 economy produces substantially larger correlations between                      consumption movements than is evidenced by the data from the                    major industrialized countries.  Several extensions of the theory               will be explored including the role of tariffs and insurance                    markets to account for this discrepancy between theory and data.                The third issue concerns the close connection between rates of                  saving and investment observed in industrial countries:  that                   those that save the most typically invest the most as well.  At                 present, most theory predicts that there should be little                       relation between the two and their close connection is considered               one of the outstanding puzzles in international economics.  This                project is important because it will provide a better                           understanding of the way the business cycle among the major                     industrialized countries are linked and may suggest ways to                     dampen these cycles.",
