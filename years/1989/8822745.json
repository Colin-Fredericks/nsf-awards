 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to determine how the                        microstructure of a mixed metal catalyst system on an oxide support or          on carbon influences reactivity and selectivity in ways not                     predictable from the properties of the individual components, and to            use variation in microstructure to  control the properties of                   supported catalysts.  Three types of systems are under study:                   multicomponent particles containing a noble metal and halogen, alkali           metal, rare earth, base metal and/or another noble metal; base metal            catalysts on various oxide supports; and particles on carbon.  High-            resolution transmission electron microscopy is used to characterize             interactions between constituents of multicomponent particles as well           as interactions of particles with supports.  Particles on graphite,             amorphous carbon, and carbon black are studied to determine how                 different types of carbon supports and treatment affect structures and          catalytic properties.  Microscopic particle characterization                    techniques for multicomponent systems are expanded by using high-               resolution analytical transmission electron microscopy and scanning             tunnelling microscopy.                                                                                                                                          This is an extension of ongoing efforts in the laboratory of the                investigators.  The systems studied are selected for their relevance            to catalysts actually used in industrial processes or in environmental          control.",
