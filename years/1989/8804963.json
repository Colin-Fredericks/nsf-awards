 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent technical innovations in light and electron microscopy,                  the development of new cellular markers, an increased capacity to               generate antibodies to specific cellular antigens, and improved                 techniques for in situ hybridization of genetic probes have                     enormously enhanced our ability to study structures at the                      cellular molecular levels.  The investigators will implement                    instrumentation which combines these recent advanced anatomical                 techniques with methods for computer image analysis that they                   have developed over the past twenty years.  The instrumentation                 will be used for visualization in three dimensions (3D) of cells,               subcellular structures and specific molecular markers within                    cells and tissues.  Computerized image processing will be used to               display stereo pairs or images with real-time rotation for 3D                   visualization, with color used to distinguish the different                     markers or structures.  The instrumentation will be used for many               different research projects.  These include studies of the                      locations of viral proteins in infected cells, the distribution                 of mRNAs in mouse cerebellar neurons, the spatiotemporal pattern                of expression of homeobox-containing genes, the morphology and                  interactions of developing and regenerating neurons, the                        distribution of different types of vesicles during exocytosis,                  and the assembly and transport of histones in yeast, as well as                 several others.  The proposed instrumentation will bring together               neurobiologists and molecular biologists with widely differing                  scientific backgrounds but with a common interest, and will thus                serve as a focus for the exchange of ideas and technical                        expertise, as well as a means for initiating cross-disciplinary                 collaborations.  It will play an important role in expanding the                range of approaches used by individual investigators, effectively               helping the neurobiologists and cell biologists to become more                  molecularly oriented, and the molecular biologists more                         cellularly oriented.",
