 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based on a successful pilot project in which the junior high school             teachers of Birmingham were involved in a year-long program of                  laboratory activities and chemistry content updating, the University of         Alabama-Birmingham will offer a similar program to twenty-five junior           high teachers from the Central Alabama area per year for three years.           The principal foci of the project are professional development and              laboratory/content updating in topics particularly suitable for                 middle/junior high school students.                                                                                                                             Every month during the school year, teachers will participate in a two-         day workshop geared toward these objectives.  Because they are in their         classroom during the intervening weeks, teachers can not only enhance           their own content background and teaching strategies, but can implement         these activities in their classrooms, sharing those experiences in an           on-going and constructive manner.  This has proven to be a very viable          design for a project of this nature.  The monthly two-day session will          be followed by a week-long summer session.                                                                                                                      The chemical activities will be patterned after those in Chemical               Activities, a recent publication of the American Chemical Society (ACS)         written by one of the consultants to the project, Christie Borgford.            This publication contains over l00 activities suitable for students at          this level and has been thoroughly checked by ACS for safety                    considerations.  A microscale approach to the laboratory work is being          initiated with a thorough evaluation to determine its effectiveness with        this age student.  Emphasis will be on strong updating of chemical              content background in topics covering social and environmental issues as        well the application of chemistry to everyday life.                                                                                                             Extensive follow-up activities are planned and an effective outreach            component will be conducted in which participants, with the support of          the project staff and their administration, will work with their peers          to enhance the laboratory offerings in their science curricula.                                                                                                 The University of Alabama Birmingham and the local school districts are         contributing an amount equivalent to 17% of the NSF request.",
