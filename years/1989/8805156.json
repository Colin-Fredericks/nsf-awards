 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of materials in metastable states is becoming very                      pervasive in many technological applications.  Very often the                   atomic arrangements in such cases have intermediate-range order                 somewhat characteristic of crystalline structure but they are not               in true thermodynamic equilibrium.  The kinetic behavior of                     metastable structures, and especially their relation to the                     equilibrium long-range ordered state, is quite poorly understood                at present.  There has been substantial progress in the theory of               non-equilibrium processes using the concepts of kinetic critical                phenomena, but little experimental work which probes directly the               microscopic mechanisms.                                                                                                                                         We propose a thorough study of this area utilizing powerful ne                  techniques in time-resolved x-ray diffuse scattering.  The                      research exploits the recent developments in x-ray sources (very                brightness synchrotron radiation) and detectors (fast two-                      dimensional CCDs) which are expected to revolutionize time-                     resolved studies.  The goal of the research is to identify                      universal features of the kinetics which can be incorporated into               a general quantitative description of non-equilibrium structural                processes.  Two model systems have been chosen for these studies;               the research will focus on the rapid thermal annealing of thin-                 film heterostructures which have important optoelectronic                       applications, and the growth and relaxation mechanisms of                       electrochemically deposited dendrites and thin film structures.",
