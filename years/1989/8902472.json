 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a mathematical theory to           describe the exchange of substances across the walls of blood                   capillaries and the movement of these substances through the surrounding        tissue.  The purpose of the circulatory system is to transport oxygen           and nutrients to every cell of the body and to remove carbon dioxide and        waste products that the cells produce.  Such substances cross the               capillary wall by fairly well understood physical processes, and they           move through the surrounding tissue either from the blood to the cells          or from the cells to the blood by a variety of different transport              mechanisms.  In addition, there is a large movement of water across the         capillary walls from the blood into the tissue or from the tissue into          the blood; such fluid movement is critically related to fluid balance           and swelling within the body.                                                                                                                                   The objective of this proposal is to mathematically describe these              complex processes in terms of the underlying basic physical principles.         A predictive theory will be developed to indicate how the body functions        under a broad range of normal and pathological conditions.  Such a              theory will provide deeper understanding of the underlying physiology.          In addition, because it is predictive, it will provide information that         supplements and extends experimental techniques, and will lead to a             decreased need for relying exclusively on animal experimentation for            physiological research.",
