 "awd_abstract_narration": "Single crystal fibers will have widespread applications in such             areas as composite materials, medicine, fiber optic sensors, and                superconductivity.  Several techniques have been used to manufacture            single crystal fibers.  However, fibers manufactured by these                   techniques either have low optical quality, short lengths, or high              cost.  These factors have prohibited the availability of high optical           quality long (several hundred meters) single crystal fibers for many            applications.  This project will investigate its laser-heated                   pedestal growth (LHPG) process to manufacture long lengths of single            crystal fibers while obtaining high optical quality and stable                  diameter.                                                                       During Phase l, a spooling mechanism  will be designed, fabricated,             and assembled to be incorporated into a LHPG growth apparatus.  With            the modified LHPG growth apparatus, an assortment of sapphire fiber             lengths of several diameters will be grown.  The minimum lengths will           be 5 meters.  These samples will be tested for diameter variations              and transmission.",
