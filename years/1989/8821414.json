 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cartography has undergone rapid changes recently, as the growing           use of computers in the preparation, construction, and analysis of maps         has transformed the discipline.  One of the most effective forums for           the interchange of ideas and information among cartographers from               throughout the world has been the biennial technical meetings of the            International Cartographic Association (ICA).  Representatives from the         ICA's 63 member nations will meet in Budapest, Hungary, in August 1989          to present research papers, to convene multi-national commissions that          plan and oversee collaborative research projects, and to meet                   informally to discuss scholarly matters of mutual interest.  This award         provides partial travel support to enable roughly one dozen American            cartographers to attend the 1989 ICA meeting.  This participation will          be especially timely, because this meeting is the first ICA meeting             held in 12 years in a Eastern Bloc country at which American                    cartographers will be in attendance.  It therefore will provide an              excellent opportunity for American cartographers to establish direct            contacts with many of their Eastern European counterparts.                           Group travel support to the ICA meetings will improve scholarly            activity by allowing more American cartographers to present the results         of their research and to hear the latest conclusions of scholars from           other nations.  By enhancing the direct exchange of ideas in both               directions, more sophisticated and effective cartographic research will         result.  The presence of more U.S. scholars at the ICA meeting also             will heighten American participation in the collaborative work of ICA           commissions, and this award will foster development of younger                  cartographers, because at least one-half of all funds will be directed          to scholars who have received their Ph.D.s within the last seven years.",
