 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. David                Crerar, Princeton University, and Dr. Jacques Schott, Laboratoire               de Geochimie, University of Paul Sabatier, France.  The objective               of this research is to study the dissolution rates and reaction                 mechanisms of minerals such as calcite, fluorite, quartz and                    feldspar in water from 25 degrees to over 400 degrees Centigrade.               In this joint project, the hydrothermal laboratories at Princeton               University will be used to measure mineral reaction rates, and                  their variation with solution composition and degree of crystal                 strain.  The reacted crystals will then be analyzed by surface                  spectroscopic techniques in Toulouse and affiliated French                      laboratories to provide detailed information on reaction processes              at mineral surfaces and the kinetic mechanisms of mineral                       reactivity.  This work has application  to understanding formation              of mineral deposits under non-equilibrium conditions typical of                 upper crystal processes and should provide insight into the                     behavior of fluids and mineral in projected radwaste repositories.                                                                                              The research by the Princeton and Toulouse groups has been                      complementary, with Princeton concentrating on hydrothermal                     dissolution rates and processes, and Toulouse on lower-T surface                reaction mechanisms.  This project will combine their expertise in              mineral reaction kinetics and allow the U.S. group to use high                  technology surface spectroscopic and analysis facilities not                    otherwise available to them.",
