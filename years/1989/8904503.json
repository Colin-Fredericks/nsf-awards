 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference will examine the ecophysiology of arctic                   plants and soil organisms and consider how this information can                 be used to understand ecosystem processes in general and the                    response of arctic ecosystems to impending climate change in                    particular.  The conference will make a significant contribution                to bridging the gap between physiological ecology and ecosystem                 ecology; ecophysiology can provide insight into the controls over               ecosystem processes, and ecosystem ecology provides a context in                which to evaluate the importance of various ecophysiological                    traits.  The meeting will be held in Churchill, Manitoba, and                   will last 4 days.  It will involve 20-25 presentations by                       physiological ecologists who have worked in the Arctic.  Also                   included in the meeting will be ecosystem ecologists who have not               worked in the Arctic.  Their role will be to provide a global                   context and to ensure that the presentations and discussion                     remain focused on the link between physiological ecology and                    ecosystem ecology.  Additional discussion will address the types                of research at the interface between ecophysiological and                       ecosystem ecology that will facilitate predictions of ecosystem                 response to impending climate change.  The products of the                      meeting will be an edited volume, a symposium at the Toronto                    meeting of the Ecological Society of America, and a summary of                  research needed to provide ecophysiological insight into the                    response of arctic ecosystems to impending climate change.",
