 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tensegrity structures are self prestressed cable networks (i.e.                 do not require anchorages), in which the cable network is                       prestressed against a discontinuous system of bars.  This                       arrangement makes these structures inherently collapsible and                   deployable, since in the unprestressed state, cables are lax and                the disjoint system of bars provides no rigidity.  Tensegrity                   structures share potential applications with other types of                     deployable structures.  They include: 1) Temporary space covering               (e.g. exhibition halls); 2) Temporary shelters in transient                     situations such as for expeditionary forces, flood and other                    natural disaster emergencies, social events; 3) Shelters in                     inhospitable climates or inaccessible areas; 4) Sports halls;                   5) Decorative, architectural space coverings; 6) Deployable                     structures in space such as dish antennae, solar collectors,                    components in space and lunar stations.  The objective of the                   proposed six months project is to demonstrate the feasibility, as               well as potential limitations of double-layer tensegrity                        networks, by fully analyzing and designing a real-scale                         prototype, and comparing the result with a more conventional                    structure such as double-layer space truss.  Combined with                      results of currently underway analytical and experimental work,                 the results of this investigation are expected to provide a firm                basis for a proposal for an investigation of larger scope.",
