 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although operant psychology, the program of research initiated by               B. F. Skinner, is expanding rapidly, the philosophy of Radical                  Behaviorism which Skinner intended to guide and defend that                     program may no longer be adequate to do so.  Not only is Radical                Behaviorism's central claim that \"the appeal to mind explains                   nothing at all\" increasingly difficult to defend, but its                       analysis of operant psychology needlessly exposes this program to               powerful criticisms.  Furthermore, by insisting that the                        behavioral approach is sufficient for the entire domain of                      psychology, Radical Behaviorism tends to disperse the efforts of                operant psychologists wastefully in many directions.                                                                                                            The question thus arises of whether there could be a more                       narrowly focused Non-Radical Behaviorism which would acknowledge                the reality of the mental but would claim that certain important                behavioral phenomena can nonetheless be explained without appeal                to mind. Already, much research in operant psychology is                        performed by psychologists who adopt such a \"Neo-Skinnerian\"                    point of view.  In this project, Dr. Terry Smith is attempting to               turn that point of view into a well-articulated philosophy.",
