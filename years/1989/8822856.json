 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1986, the new AISC Load and Resistance Factor Design                         (LRFD) Specification was introduced which makes the limit                       state design of steel buildings as an alternate to the traditional              Allowable Stress Design.  LRFD represents a major advancement                   in steel design technology that is based on safety reliability                  concepts and an explicit consideration of factored loads and                    limit states.  However, the Specification is primarily intended                 for designs governed by gravity or wind loads.  Thus, in                        regions of high and moderate seismicity, supplemental special                   detailing requirements are necessary to provide adequate                        structural ductility and energy absorption commensurate with                    the degree of earthquake risk.  The currently available seismic                 detailing provisions are in allowable stress terms and,                         therefore, are not directly compatible with LRFD.                                                                                                               The development of a set of seismic design provisions, for the                  first time in LRFD format, has recently been completed by an                    expert AISC Subcommittee.  Only the preparation of an                           appropriate Commentary remains before this needed document                      can be published and broadly distributed for LRFD design                        applications.                                                                                                                                                   This project will support a concerted effort over the next 3-6                  months on the Commentary to finish this document and satisfy                    the urgent needs of engineers and building code officials.  This                will help maintain proper design practice and safety levels as                  LRFD is used for seismic conditions.  The tasks will include                    review and listing of related research references, thorough                     explanation of background material and practical implications of                criteria, and discussion/artwork of additional general                          suggestions not covered directly by the provisions.",
