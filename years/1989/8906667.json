 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will focus on the causes of variation in the number               of seeds that a plant produces by donating pollen to other                      individuals.  Preliminary studies of rose mallow (Hibiscus                      moscheutos) showed that 1) pollen tubes, which carry paternal                   genes to the ovary, often compete for ovules within a flower, and               2) some individuals have faster growing pollen tubes than others.                                                                                               These differences among individuals are probably important in                   determining which plants sire the most seeds in natural                         populations.  The investigators will examine the relative                       importance of genetic vs. environmental effects on pollen                       performance.  They will also test the hypothesis that pollen tube               growth rates are positively correlated with seedling growth                     rates.                                                                               Results can be directly applied to agricultural problems by                determining whether genetically superior seedlings can be                       artificially selected by hand-pollinating flowers with large                    amounts of pollen from a large group of donor plants.                           Fundamental questions will also be addressed about the                          reproductive ecology of wild plants, which should be conserved                  for their potential role as genetic \"libraries\".  Useful genetic                variation in this wild hibiscus could eventually be introduced                  into related species, such as cultivated hibiscus, cotton, okra,                and kenaf, to improve their vigor and yield.",
