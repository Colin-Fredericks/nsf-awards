 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports geological field research                   in Pakistan by the P.I. Dr. John W. Shervais and his Pakistani                  doctoral student, M. Tahir Shah; and laboratory research by                     Mr. Shah in the laboratory of Dr. M. Ikramuddin at Eastern                      Washington University.  The research objectives include:                        1) assessment of the distribution of gold and silver within                     and adjacent to the base metal lead-zinc ore bodies and the                     correlation between precious metal concentrations and base                      metal ore grades; 2) assessment of the usefullness of                           pathfinder elements in locating volcanogenic ore deposits in                    high grade metamorphic terrains, and 3) evaluation of the                       origin of the lead-zinc deposits in the Besham area of                          Pakistan in light of the new geochemical data.  Mr. Shah will                   collect samples in Pakistan in two areas that represent a                       single primary ore body that has been offset structurally, the                  Lahore and the Pazang lead-zinc sulfide deposits.  He will                      conduct geochemical analysis of these samples at Eastern                        Washington University under supervision of Dr. Ikramuddin.                                                                                                      Scope:  The research will bring together, in addition to the                    Pakistan graduate student, scientists from the University of                    South Carolina, and  Eastern Washington University, and                         geologists from the University of Peshwar in Pakistan who have                  extensive experience in the geology of Pakistan.  The work is                   likely to lead to improvement in the understanding of the                       geochemistry of minerals of economic value, and to enhance the                  scientific capabilities of the Pakistani graduate student and                   his potential to contribute to the technical and economic                       development of his country.",
