 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main focus of this study is to test models of climate-                 induced geomagnetic field behavior which predict a correlation                  between time-dependent variations in the volume of global ice and               time-dependent variations in the paleomagnetic vector.  A                       previously-published record of Pleistocene variations in  18O                   from deep-sea sediment cores is used to represent changes in                    global ice volume for last 500,000 years.  The variations in the                magnetic field during this time interval are represented by a                   record of paleomagnetic directional data from a sedimentary                     sequence exposed in south-central Oregon.  Prior to comparing the               two records 1) a detailed sampling program was conducted to                     improve the accuracy of the existing paleomagnetic record and 2)                a moving-window cross-spectral analysis was conducted to improve                the age control.  The latter method is one of three independent                 age control methods underway at three academic institutions to                  improve the age control.  Angular dispersion analysis and band-                 pass filtering are among the methods used in the comparison                     between the improved paleomagnetic record and the  18O record.                  Whether or not the improvements in age control are sufficient to                allow the testing of the above models, the paleomagnetic record                 will contribute significantly to research in geomagnetism,                      stratigraphy, and tectonics.",
