 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lignin is a polymer comprised of a network of propylphenyl                 subunits linked by a series of phenolic ether bonds.  It is known               that the major precursor of lignin can survive, with only ring                  demethoxylation, early diagenesis during coalification and that                 subsequent transformation into aromatic macromolecule occurs                    during catagenesis.  The application of lignin as a paleo-                      vegetation marker depends on the number of methoxyl groups                      present in the phenolic component of the lignin polymer.                        However, the stepwise degradation or demethoxylation of lignin in               the diagenetic stage has not been extensively investigated.                                                                                                          The research project will examine the lignin degradation                   products after short-term thermal alteration of wood and immature               coals with and without mineral (clay) matrices.  The results from               this study should contribute significantly to the understanding                 of the chemical changes undergone by the precursors of coal                     during peatification and early coalification.  The data should                  provide important information on the use of lignin as a paleo-                  vegetation biomarker and paleoclimatic indicator in sedimentary                 rocks, peats and coals.  Further, the artificial pyrolysis trends               could be applicable to real geological samples such as coals in                 correlating the diagenetic changes of lignin phenols.",
