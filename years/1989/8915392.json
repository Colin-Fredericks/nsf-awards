 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Beck and Jones will conduct systematic research to evaluate                the potential of the obsidian hydration technique to determine                  the ages of archaeological artifacts from the Butte Valley,                     Nevada.  Obsidian hydration dating rests on the premise that the                hydration rind which forms on this volcanic glass is time                       dependent and that by measuring the depth of this rim,                          chronological information can be obtained.  While this                          relationship is known to hold true for buried artifacts which                   undergo only moderate temperature change throughout the course of               the year, it is unclear how well hydration works for surface                    materials which undergo large annual fluctuations.  Drs. Beck and               Jones will collect obsidian artifacts associated with known                     cultures in the Butte Valley.  They will then determine chemical                composition by using x-ray florescence and, by this means, divide               them by source of origin.  Hydration analysis will be conducted                 on a large sample and the results analyzed to determine the                     correlation with age as determined by cultural affiliation.                     Temperature sensors planted at sites, both above and below                      ground, will provide information on annual temperature                          fluctuation.                                                                                                                                                    Across much of the U.S. Great Basin, archaeological materials                   which document the early stages of human prehistory are found                   primarily on the desert surface.  These assemblages, while they                 have the potential to yield valuable archaeological information,                must often be ignored because they are so difficult to date.  If                their research is successful, Drs. Beck and Jones will provide                  archaeologists with a technique which may be used in a wide range               of sites in many parts of the world.  It will also allow these                  two archaeologists to proceed with their cultural reconstruction                of the prehistory of the Western United States and, thus,                       increase our understanding of native American cultural                          development.",
