Our work in each          of these investigations is based on two theoretical principles: the             assistant approach (incremental automation) and the exploitation of             cliches (using knowledge of common engineering practice).                                                                                                       Each investigation involves the construction of a prototype system to           provide intelligent assistance for a person performing the task: A              recognition assistant will help reconstruct the design of a program,            given only its source code.  A design assistant will assist a                   programmer by detecting errors and inconsistencies in his design                choices and by automatically making many straightforward implementation         decisions.  An optimization assistant will help improve the performance         of programs by identifying intermediate results that can be reused.  A          debugging assistant will aid in the detection, localization, and repair         of errors in designs as well as completed programs.                                                                                                             These prototypes will be constructed using two shared technologies: a           programming-language-independent formal representation for programs and         programming knowledge (the Plan Calculus) and an automated reasoning            system (CAKE), which supports both general logical reasoning and                special-purpose decision procedures.",
