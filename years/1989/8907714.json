 "awd_abstract_narration": "East-west oriented jets are observed in the high latitudes                 of the troposphere, the oceans and other planetary atmospheres.                 Explanations of \"eddy-forced\" zonal jets usually require some                   external influence, such as geometrical boundaries or localized                 forcing, to account for their spatial persistence.  Preliminary                 calculations indicate that, when motions are quasi-geostrophic,                 energy arising from the instability of an imposed, spatially                    uniform, north-south temperature gradient can be organized into                 jets of a persistence not directly linked to feature of the                     forcing.  The scale of the jet is self-determined, so that once a               region is sufficiently wide to support one jet, further widening                of the region increases the number of jets.                                          The goal of this research project is to examine the source                 of this persistence and its scale using (relatively) simple two-                layer models embodying various numbers of wave-wave interactions.               Special attention will be paid to how maintenance and persistence               are affected during the transition from a regime that supports a                single jet to one supporting two.  The influence of linear wave                 dynamics in determining the scale of the jets will be examined                  using different indices of wave activity.  An examination of the                transition regime may also indicate which low frequency processes               play a prominent role in the Northern Hemisphere where a second                 jet does not emerge.",
