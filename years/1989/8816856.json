 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many authors have stressed the significance of small-scale                 stratigraphic cycles and discontinuity bounded sequences in                     geochronology and in understanding depositional processes.  As a                result of extensive detailed studies of event stratigraphy of the               Middle Devonian (Hamilton Group), we have recognized numerous                   small- and large-scale cyclic, bounded packages, some of which                  are widely traceable and appear to be allocyclic in nature.  We                 also postulate that: 1) an upward-shallowing motif, at least in                 larger-scale cycles, is not pervasive, rather cycles are                        subsymmetrical near basin centers, but grade marginward into                    asymmetrical shallowing-upward sequences; 2) that the bounding                  surfaces of packages may record either sea level fall or rise,                  but 3) that they represent discontinuities of considerable                      magnitude; 4) depocenters of successive cyclic sequences display                a regular westward migration that is consistent with current                    models of thrust loading in foreland basins.                                         As a test of the generality of these patterns we will                      thoroughly document the sedimentology, taphonomy, paleontology                  and regional distribution of small-scale coarsening-upward                      sequences of the Hamilton Group in central New York State, and                  their correlatives in other areas.  In particular, we will focus                on a) correlation of bounded cycles across a shelf-to-basin                     profile; b) lateral symmetry changes within cycles; c) internal                 facies anatomy of small scale cyclic packages; and d) the nature                and temporal scale of bounding surfaces.  This research will lead               to better understanding of relative sea-level fluctuations and                  depositional dynamics of a muddy foreland basin and could serve                 as a model for interpreting similar settings throughout the                     geologic record.",
