 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the participation of approxi-           mately 15 U.S. engineers in a small conference intended to examine the          state of the art in the control of particulate process operations.  The         meeting was organized jointly by Professors K. Rajamani and John A.             Herbst of the University of Utah and Antti Niemi of the Control                 Engineering Laboratory of the Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo,         Finland.  The conference will deal with all aspects of the control of           particulate processes, including modeling, optimization and computer            control.  The processes of interest are: solid-solid and solid-liquid           separation, agglomeration, comminution, crystallization, solvent                extraction and leaching.  Topics for sessions are: dynamic models,              control strategies, theoretical aspects of control and expert systems,          and process optimization.  Advancement in the field of control in the           past decade has been furthered primarily by three factors: new computer         hardware, process instrumentation and process control theory.  Much of          the advanced work combining these three elements has been done in the           U.S. and Finland.  In fact, the earliest plant scale control application        was implemented in Finland in the 1960's.  Thus, Finnish research and           operating experience leads the world in important respects, and it is           highly appropriate that a joint U.S.-Finnish meeting be held to examine         the state of the art and identify directions for future research.                                                                                               The particulate process industries, i.e., those involved with the               processing of minerals, chemicals, cement and coal, face serious                problems in energy costs and the declining reserve of raw materials.            Thus they must constantly seek new technologies to remain competitive.          Process control, or the regulation of their processing operations by            computer, has emerged as one of the most important options available to         these industries to improve plant productivity without enormous capital         investment.  This meeting of researchers and practitioners from the             U.S., Finland, and several other countries, will contribute to the              synthesis and enhancement of existing knowledge in this important field         and set directions for needed future research.",
