 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports interdisciplinary cooperative                               research in the delignification of wood to be                                   conducted by Robert A. Blanchette of the University of                          Minnesota and Eduardo A. Trumper of the University of                           Chile in Santiago.  They will carry out chemical,                               biochemical and structural investigations to determine                          the mechanisms responsible for the preferential                                 degradation of lignin by \"palo podrido,\" a type of                              white rot found only in the rain forests of southern                            Chile.  Cellulose is not degraded and the wood becomes                          highly digestible.  The major enzymes, which move from                          the fungus into the wood, the morphology of how they                            move and how they attack lignin in the cell walls all                           will be studied using immunocytochemical methods.                                                                                                               The research will provide an understanding of                                   decomposition processes, information for use in new                             biotechnologies as well as on how to use enzymes from                           lignin-degrading fungi for industrial purposes.  The                            investigators have complementary backgrounds and both                           have excellent credentials.  The facilities at St.                              Paul and at Santiago are completely adequate for this                           work which will be a good example of cooperation under                          the Science in Developing Countries program.",
