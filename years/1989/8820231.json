 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stars are generally characterized by a decrease in their                        temperature from the interior (where the temperature is typically               millions of degrees Kelvin) to the surface (where the temperature               is thousands or tens of thousands of degrees Kelvin).  In the sun               and other stars with surface (i.e., photospheric) temperatures of               roughly 6000 K and less the temperature rises sharply in the                    transparent, outermost layers due to energy deposited from                      magnetic surface activities.  In the sun, the region in which the               temperature starts rising has traditionally been known as the                   chromosphere.  More recently, the processes giving rise to this                 temperature inversion have been called the \"molecular cooling                   catastrophes\" because radiative cooling by CO and other molecules               appears to be responsible for it.                                                                                                                               The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to study the regions of                temperature inversion in the atmospheres of late-type stars and                 compare them to those of the sun.  The observational input data                 will be spatially-unresolved spectra of these stars, which the PI               and his collaborators have accumulated over the past three years.               This data will be processed by computer codes capable of solving                the molecular non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) problem.",
