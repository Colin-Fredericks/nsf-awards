 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbial ecologist are unsure of the composition and                      Traditional culture dependent methods for microbial communities                 cannot ensure the recognition of all community members.  This                   limits understanding of how toxicants and genetically engineered                organisms affect natural microbial communities.  Recently the                   development of new molecular methods for analyzing a specific                   cellualr component, 16S ribosomal RNA, was completed as a means                 of identifying the various inhabitants of natural microbial                     communities without traditional culture techniques.  The initial                results using these methods demonstrate that natural communities                do contain many inhabitants which were previously not noted in                  microbial studies.  The composition and structure of a model hot                spring cyanobacterial mat community will be determined in this                  proposal through in depth comparative analysis of 16S rRNA                      sequences previously obtained for the microbial mat.  This should               reveal the magnitude of the differences between real community                  complexity and that portion described by the pure culture                       collection.  The well-studied nature of this model will also be                 explpoited to investigate the trophic structure of the community,               as well as possible problems limiting the application of all rRNA               methods usng 16S rRNA-based hybridization probes.",
