 "awd_abstract_narration": "A partnership of the University of South Carolina, the South Carolina           Geological Survey, the Mining Association of South Carolina, and the            South Carolina Earth Science Teachers Association will:                                                                                                             1. Mobilize, develop, and disseminate those resources available in          South Carolina which will strengthen the teaching of earth science at           all levels;                                                                         2. Develop a cadre of fifteen geographically distributed Earth              Science Teacher Resource Agents capable of distributing these and other         resources to their peers;                                                           3. Implement a peer education and support system utilizing the Earth        Science Teacher Resource Agents.                                                                                                                                This program will respond to three broad needs which have been                  identified among the state's earth science teachers:                                                                                                                1. South Carolina mandates that earth science be taught in the              eighth grade, and the state has established earth science as one of             three broad areas of science which will be tested as a \"basic skill\";               2. South Carolina's earth science teachers are under-prepared with          respect to knowledge of content, teaching strategies based on \"inquiry\",        and recent advances in science education;                                           3. There exists no mechanism to mobilize and disseminate human and          material resources for the earth science classroom, or to identify and          develop such resources where they are needed.                                                                                                                   Cost sharing by the partners will total 73% of the National Science             Foundation funding.",
