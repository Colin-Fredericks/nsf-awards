 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the feasibility of             producing model foreign gene products, chloramphenicol                          acetyltransferase (cat) or \u001a-glucuronidase (gus), from genetically              modified tobacco cell culture, Nicotiana tabacum.  The production of            cat or gus enzymes will be monitored in batch, semi-batch, and                  continuous bio-reactors, and optimum conditions will be determined.             The stability of the genetically modified plant cells will be tested            in long-term continuous operations.                                                                                                                             Plant cells can be grown in a liquid solution containing sugar and              other ingredients, which may be employed for the production of                  important plant products, such as pharmaceuticals, flavors, and                 pigments.  The long-term objectives of this proposed research are to            genetically engineer plant cells to produce valuable pharmaceutical             products and to develop an economically viable, industrial-scale                process suitable for production.  As a first step, the study will               examine the feasibility of producing model protein products from                genetically altered plant cell culture in a laboratory-scale fermenter          system.",
