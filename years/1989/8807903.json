 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scholars have long been interested in who does and does not participate         in the voluntary social and political activities that are a fundamental         part of American life.  This study attends to this topic at a time in           contemporary society when individuals are more active and the ways in           which they participate have expanded considerably.  Despite this                heightened activity vast disparities exist in the effectiveness with            which certain groups - - the poor, racial and ethnic minorities, women,         immigrants - - are entering the participatory system.  Of central               concern in this investigation is a focus on these groups in order to            understand better whose interests are represented and whose ignored by          the major social and political institutions.  By analyzing the process          by which some citizens become active while others do not, the                   researchers may generate practical knowledge for dealing with the gap           between democratic ideals of equal representation and reality.                                                                                                  The investigators will undertake a carefully crafted and comprehensive          empirical study, one of the main purposes of which will be to develop a         data resource on participation in American life.  In order to obtain a          representative sample of politically active respondents, the                    investigators will conduct a telephone screener survey of approximately         ten minutes in length with 15,000 respondents.  This will be followed           by a sixty minute face-to-face interview with 2,000 respondents that is         weighted toward activists.  This research design will allow the                 researchers to screen for, and interview, enough minorities and highly          active participators to achieve maximum reliability and validity of             results.                                                                                                                                                        The output of this research will yield important findings about who             participates in political activities and should provide the most                detailed description of American political behavior ever available.             The investigation will also produce a much more theoretical and nuanced         picture of American political and voluntary activity.",
