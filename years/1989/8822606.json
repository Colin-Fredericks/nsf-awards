 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flower development in the plant family Haemodoraceae and                   close relatives will be studied using light and scanning                        electron microscopy by Dr. Michael Simpson of San Diego State                   University.  The purpose of the study is to clarify past                        evolutionary relationships within this group.  Specific                         objectives include:  1) recognizing new descriptive characters;                 2) assessing character homology (similarity by common ancestry);                3) determining character ancestry; and 4) testing hypotheses of                 evolutionary change.  The project is innovative in utilizing                    morphometrics, mathematical techniques for tracing changes in                   shape and form.  Morphometric data will be acquired using a                     computerized video image analysis system that measures                          coordinate, length, and area parameters.  Developmental stages of               ovules, seeds, and ovary will be traced by establishing a                       relative time scale, calibrated by recording embryological stage,               the relative position of the bud in the inflorescence, or the                   length of major floral organs.  Statistical procedures, including               bivariate plots and principle components analysis, will be used                 to trace developmental changes.  By comparing growth rates of                   organs relative to known ancestor/descendent relationships, the                 possible occurrence of heterochrony (change in rate or timing of                development) in structural evolution will be tested.  Finally, an               attempt will be made to assess the possible adaptive significance               of floral organs by correlating these developmental parameters                  with biogeography, ecology, and pollination mechanisms.//",
