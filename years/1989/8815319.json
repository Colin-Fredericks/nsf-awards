 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Winston Knight of the                         University of Rhode Island in collaboration with Professor P.                   Bariani of the University of Padua, Italy.  The objective of                    this joint research is the development of knowledge based                       procedures for computer-aided cold forging process design and                   estimating.  Process planning and estimating for the manufacture                of engineering products are activities that rely heavily on the                 skilled interpretation of experienced personnel for the                         effective development of work plans and estimates.  Computer                    based procedures for process planning have attempted to                         incorporate the manufacturing knowledge of experienced planners                 in a readily usable form through a variety of approaches.                       However, most attention in the development of computer-aided                    process planning (CAPP) systems has been devoted to machinery                   processes and relatively little on the important area of process                planning for forming operations.  This research is concerned                    with basic investigations into the development of integrated                    systems for computer-aided estimating, and process design for                   multi-stage cold forging processes.  The implementation of the                  overall system will require the establishment of a knowledge                    base, the development of the interpretation logic for sequence                  design and cost estimation, and the integration into the system.                                                                                                The problem is an important one for manufacturing operations and                the approach is sound.  The group at the University of Rhode                    Island will focus on the manufacturing knowledge representation                 and cost analysis procedures, while the group at Padua will be                  concerned with the interpretation logic, tool design, and                       sequence evaluation procedures.",
