 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an empirical investigation into the effects of                  changes in corporate capital structure on the long term                         investment strategies of firms, motivated by an interest in the                 general question of whether publicly traded corporations are the                best medium for the financing of investment directed toward long                term growth of the economy.  In the course of this project, a                   large panel data set of manufacturing firms with data from 86                   through 88 will be updated.  This augments the sample of                        manufacturing mergers (about 600 from 76-85) with those which                   occurred during 86, 87, and 88.  The project uses the new sample                to replicate and extend previous findings on the effects of                     mergers on R&D investment, paying particular attention to the                   longer term effects and to the effects of changing leverage on                  the firm's strategies.  Finally, the project builds and estimates               a model of the joint choice of financing and investment by the                  firm which incorporates tax differences, asymmetric information,                and transactions costs.  The model is used to investigate the                   hypothesis that R&D investment is more easily financed out of                   retained earnings than out of new debt or equity (relative to                   other kinds of investment).  If this is true, changes in                        debt/equity ratios may tilt the incentives for investment away                  from R&D.                                                                                                                                                       The project contributes to our understanding of R&D with better                 data, improved theory and empirical studies.  The original data                 set is an important resource for studies of R&D expenditures by                 U.S. manufacturing firms.  The empirical research by this project               addresses an extremely timely issue, the effects of mergers on                  U.S. technology.  Preliminary results by the investigator raise                 the disturbing possibility that certain types of mergers weaken                 U.S. R&D efforts.",
