 "awd_abstract_narration": "+he Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is supporting the work                  of Dr. William H. Okamura of the Department of Chemistry at the                 University of California at Riverside.  Dr. Okamura is                          developing thermal reactions that can be carried out at                         relatively low temperatures that result in the rapid and                        efficient formation of complex ring systems.  These will                        provide new routes to the complex materials needed in modern                    agriculture and industry.                                                                                                                                       The purpose of the research is to carry out exploratory                         mechanistic and synthetic investigations on the manner in which                 chiral conjugated allenes and other polyenes participate in                     carbon-carbon and carbon-hetero atom bond forming                               pericyclization reactions.  The significance of this study is                   that by systematically evaluating pericyclic and other                          reactions of polyenes that lead to new bond formation, both                     mechanistic and theoretical insight into these processes should                 obtain.  Moreover, a detailed understanding of how substituents                 and substitution patterns affect the stereomechanistic course                   of pericyclizations should lend information to the synthetic                    chemist as to how to better develop and design synthetic                        methods.  The synthetic impact of the current proposal is that                  methodology pertinent to the synthesis of chiral polycyclic                     building blocks should emerge.  The topics include the                          development of an understanding of pi-facial stereoselectivity                  effects by substituents on electrocyclic processes and                          exploration of the scope and limitations of the allene variant                  of electrocyclizations, \u01313,3!-sigmatropic shifts and                            cycloaddition processes.",
