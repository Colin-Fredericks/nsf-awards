 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in atomic physics                between Dr. J. R. Mowat, North Carolina State University at                     Raleigh and Dr. Reinhold Schuch, Research Institute of Physics,                 Stockholm, Sweden.  Dr. Mowat will carry out a series of                        experiments on the simulation of electron cooling in the ion                    storage ring, which is a completely new technology for atomic                   physics research.                                                                                                                                               Dr. Mowat's research is directed at experiments to be carried out               on future ion storage rings in the US, but, for the time being, it              is necessary to keep in close contact with the European projects                which are already under construction.  Full realization of the                  potential of these storage rings requires that electron cooling, a              technique for enhancing the quality of stored beams, works for                  ions.  Realistic simulations of electron cooling are needed by ion              storage ring designers, and certain atomic physics effects must be              carefully included in the simulations.  The work in Raleigh will                concentrate on the improvement of computer simulations which model              electron cooling of stored ions and electron-ion collisions                     experiments.  The first summer in Sweden (1989) will be spent                   testing the actual electron cooling device, while the second                    summer (1990) will be spent carrying out atomic physics                         experiments with the newly completed storage ring.",
