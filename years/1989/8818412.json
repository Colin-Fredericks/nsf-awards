 "awd_abstract_narration": "Basic research will be carried out on thermal properties of solid               and liquid phases, kinetics of phase transitions,                               conformationally disordered phases, and strained molecules in                   phase boundaries.  Thermal properties research is to connect to                 prior work that led to a data bank with information on Cp, H, S                 and G on about a hundred polymers.  Experimentation is to                       continue and expand by building a 10-300 K scanning calorimeter,                an instrument not available in this country.  The theory of heat                capacity is to be advanced by the study of skeletal vibrations                  and anharmonicity.  The kinetics of phase transitions are to be                 followed by simulation of molecular nucleation on a supercomputer               using molecular dynamics, and by collection of further data on                  segregation on crystallization.  Condis crystals are to be                      studied by thermal analysis (entropy evaluation), solid-state NMR               (motion assessment), X-ray and neutron scattering (structure                    determination) and computer simulation (understanding of roto-                  repartition).  The strained molecules, finally, are to be                       quantitatively evaluated by thermal analysis (rigid amorphous                   fraction), solid-state NMR (motion), and energy-sensitive                       electron microscopy (location of rigid molecule parts).  Overall,               these projects are designed to advance materials characterization               and understanding of properties and processes in polymeric as                   well an nonpolymeric substances.",
