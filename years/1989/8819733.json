 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is the continuation of a long-term project, begun                 in 1972, to study the ecology, behavior, and demography of                      mantled howler monkeys.  The objectives of the study are to                     examine what influences density, dispersion, reproductive                       success, and food selection of the monkeys.  Ecological and                     behavioral data will be collected on individuals living (1) in                  different habitats; (2) at different population densities; and,                 (3) in different-sized social groups.  A comparative analysis of                the results will be done to test various hypotheses generated                   from sociobiological theory.  One hypothesis, for example, is                   \"Group members share resources with relatives\" more than with                   non-relatives.  The research is able to concentrate on individual               strategies because most of the total population of 350 howlers                  are uniquely marked and identifiable.  Long-term and                            multidisciplinary studies of marked animals can provide valuable                information on life-history variables and kinship relationships,                factors which can change over time.                                                                                                                             Many species of nonhuman primates are either threatened or highly               endangered and attempts are being make to protect the most                      endangered.  One powerful tool in this regard is mathematical                   modeling, and models must be tested with data from long-term                    demographic studies such as this one.",
