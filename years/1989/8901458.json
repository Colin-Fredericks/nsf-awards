 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been increasing, mutual benefit between the mathematical              field of graph theory, a study of finite configurations and their               interconnections, and the theoretical study in computer science of              combinatorial (finite) algorithms.  This research focuses on                    topological graph theory, an area particularly enhanced by these                interrelations:  this field and this proposal, in particular, consider          the embedding (or drawing) of graphs on surfaces (the sphere plus               handles) and seeks solutions to questions both abstract and                     algorithmic.  The project will extend knowledge about noncontractible           cycles in embedded graphs and about sets of vertices whose removal              decreases the genus or after repeated deletion leaves a planar graph.           Results on these structures would lead to information on other                  embedding parameters, such as thickness and layout, and would try               to extend results about the well-understood planar graphs, for                  example, in the areas of graph colorings and embedding algorithms.                                                                                              The interactive activities include teaching a topics course in                  combinatorial theory; giving a series of seminars in the mathematics            department's weekly combinatorics seminar and inviting a number of              distinguished women combinatorics researchers to that seminar; and              presenting one or two panels, including Northwest-area women                    mathematics researchers, on \"Some experiences of women in mathematics\"          and \"On being a research mathematician.\"                                                                                                                        This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
