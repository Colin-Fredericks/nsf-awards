 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Summy-Long is using her Career Advancement Award to learn the               state of the art molecular techniques which will allow her to                   investigate independently gene expression in magnocellular                      neurosecretory cells.  Magnocellular neurons synthesize                         vasopressin, a peptide that regulates fluid balance and blood                   pressure, and oxytocin, a peptide released during lactation to                  initiate milk let-down in response to suckling and at parturition               to contract the uterus.  The oxytocinergic neurons as part of the               magnocellular system undergo plasticity beginning during                        pregnancy at mid-gestation and lasting through lactation.  This                 plasticity is expressed in the formation of new and reversible                  synapses involving growth and adaption of neurons.  Although the                morphological changes and electrophysiological activity are well                understood, knowledge of the control of these adaptive changes at               the cellular level is rudimentary.  Dr. Summy-Long will examine                 the role that proto-oncogenes, especially  c-fos, play in                       oxytocinergic neurons that undergo plasticity during lactation.                 These studies provide a foundation for probing further how and                  when proto-oncogenes are expressed in neurons.  The research has                implications for reproductive neuroendocrinology as well as for                 cancer, since understanding proto-oncogene expression in normal                 cells during changes in physiology may provide clues as to how                  this regulation becomes aberrant.",
