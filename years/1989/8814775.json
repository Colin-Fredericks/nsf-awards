Specifically, Dr.                Wiens and Polhill plan to complete a book-length manuscript on the              classification and biological aspects of the African                            representatives of the plant families Loranthaceae and Viscaeae.                These families are commonly known as mistletoes and have a                      worldwide, primarily tropical, distribution. Both  families exhibit             relatively high species diversity in Africa, with a combined total              of about 250 species.  This project is a culmination of                         approximately five years of collaborative study between the two                 investigators and has encompassed field studies over much of the                African continent.                                                                                                                                              The result of this study should be a significant contribution to                the study of biodiversity of the African flora.  The African                    members of these families have not been studied in detail since the             turn of the century.",
