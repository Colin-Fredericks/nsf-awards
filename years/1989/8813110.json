 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spawning area and oceanic migratory cues for American                       and European eels have long remained enigmatic.  Because young                  eel larvae are concentrated immediately to the south of the                     North Atlantic Subtropical Convergence in the Sargasso Sea,                     it is hypothesized that mature eels cease migration and spawn                   near this front and use physical or biological features of                      the front for orientation.  This research will directly test                    (1) whether maturing adult American eels are concentrated in,                   or immediately to the south of, the frontal zone, and (2) how                   the fine-scale vertical and horizontal distributions of adults                  are related specifically to characteristics of the frontal                      zone and adjacent waters.                                                                                                                                       Quantitative hydroacoustic sampling will be used to identify                    echoes of appropriate strength to be eels and to map their                      distributional patterns and densitites.  Aimed midwater                         trawling, video from a remotely operated vehicle, traps                         baited with mature captive eels, and fine-scale sampling of                     eggs and newly hatched larvae will be used to verify whether                    targets are actually eels.  Hydroacoustic data, midwater                        trawling, and profiles of temperature and salinity will be                      used to characterize the biological and physical features                       of the front.                                                                                                                                                   This research links open-ocean spawing of a physiologically                     unique, long-distance migrating fish to a specific                              oceanographic feature.",
