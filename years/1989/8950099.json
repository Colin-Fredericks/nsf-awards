 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a pilot project to provide nine undergraduate faculty members           with the opportunity to keep up with the newest advances in                     microbiology (immunology, medical microbiology, and molecular biology)          by working on a one-to-one basis with a mentor who is a research                scientist in one of those specialties.  The participants will attend            the 1990 Annual meeting of the American Society of Microbiology and             then visit the mentor's laboratory for a month during the summer,               during which time the participant will be exposed to the mentor's               research program.  This will be followed by a two-day visit of the              mentor to the participant's institution.  A Steering Committee will             select the participants and the mentors, with an eye toward substantial         participation by women and minorities.  The steering committee will             also evaluate the success of the program - how the participants'                knowledge of these areas of biology was enhanced, and how they                  incorporated these new areas into their teaching.                                                                                                               A.S.M. will make an in-kind contribution to cover the time spent by the         senior personnel on the project.",
