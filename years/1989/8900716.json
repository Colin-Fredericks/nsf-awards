 "awd_abstract_narration": "The solar surface layers are characterized by numerous energetic                phenomena that follow an eleven-year cycle, the so-called sunspot               cycle.  The next maximum in this cycle will occur in 1991.  The                 number of sunspots and energetic erruptions is now, in 1989,                    already steadily increasing and building up to the maximum two                  years hence.  The most energetic phenomena of such a cycle are                  called \"flares.\"  They are regions characterized by the localized               buildup of strong magnetic fields, the sudden release of energy                 associated with these fields, acceleration of charged particles,                and heating of plasma.                                                                                                                                          The Principal Investigator  proposes to carry out an                            observational project with the goal of understanding better the                 origin and temporal development of solar flares.  In particular,                he will determine the spatial and temporal distribution of                      energetic particle acceleration in the solar atmosphere and their               effects on the structure and evolution of magnetic fields.  In                  addition, he will study magnetic reconnection, shocks, and energy               and momentum transport during the course of flare development.                  New and existing data will be used.",
