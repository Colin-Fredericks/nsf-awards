 "awd_abstract_narration": "A joint meeting of the Population Biologists of the Northeast                   (PBONE) and the Southeastern Ecological Genetics Group (SEEGG)                  will be held at Virginia Tech on May 17/19, 1990.  Formal                       sessions will consist of three plenary addresses by nationally                  known speakers from outside the PBONE-SEEGG area, 24 short talks                by participants, 36 talks by workshop participants, and poster                  sessions.  A special feature of these meetings are the                          invitations that have been sent to 200 or more small colleges in                a 5-state area (NC-TN-KY-VA-WVA) urging that their biology                      professors and most promising undergraduate students (especially                women and members of minority group) attend.  Special field trips               and other exercises planned for these invited guests; more                      importantly, however, is the opportunity these meetings will give               these young persons for observing how their peers from larger                   institutions comport themselves and for these students to make                  contacts that may facilitate their acceptance into graduate                     programs.",
