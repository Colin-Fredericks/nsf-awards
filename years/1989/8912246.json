 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop an in vivo system                  for study of the effects of maternal serum Insulin.like Growth                  Factor (IGF) levels on fetal rat development.  The recognition                  that\u001a growth factors may influence several aspects of development               has excited interest in defining the true range of their effects                and action mechanisms.  IGF.II has been implicated as a regulator               of embryogenis and fetal growth, and the proposed research seeks                ultimately to determine the soundness of this implication.  The                 experimental approach will utilize IGF.II secreting tumors to                   raise maternal IGF.II levels, and explore the relation of these                 elevated levels to placental.binding and passage of the factor,                 and to patterns of fetal growth.  The initial objective is to                   determine the effectiveness of the tumor system for perturbing                  placental and fetal IGF.II levels.  Subsequent efforts will be                  devoted to reducing the interpretive complexity of the system to                a level that will permit direct analysis of IGF.II effects on the               fetus.  If successful, this system may generate data not easily                 available by other approaches, and increase our understanding of                regulatory mechanisms of growth and development.              //",
