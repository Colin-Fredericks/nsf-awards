 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Natsume's project has to do with functorial                      invariants, called K-theory and cyclic cohomology, for algebras                 of operators. The problems to be tackled concern noncommutative                 ramifications of ideas from geometry. One such problem is to                    exhibit geometrically an explicit nontrivial generator for K-                   nought of certain operator algebras associated to the fundamental               group of a closed Riemann surface, and to find as well a cyclic                 cocycle on an appropriate dense subalgebra that pairs                           nontrivially with this generator. Another facet of the project                  involves foliated manifolds and the operator algebras to which                  they give rise.                                                                      The fundamental insight of the area of mathematical research               in which Professor Natsume works is the following: complete                     information about the structure of a space (a surface, say, or                  some higher dimensional analogue) is stored in an appropriate                   algebra of functions on the space. (Functions assign number                     values to points in the space.) Everything one would want to say                about the geometry of a compact manifold, for instance, can be                  stated in terms of the algebra of infinitely differentiable                     complex functions on the manifold. This algebra, like so many                   interesting objects in mathematics, can be represented usefully                 as an algebra of operators on Hilbert space. Quite often,                       geometrical or topological notions that make sense for algebras                 of smooth or continuous functions also make sense for more or                   less arbitrary operator algebras. Working algebraically has the                 twofold merit of clarifying ideas, and also of permitting the use               of machinery such as K-theory that works much better in the                     context of algebras than of spaces. Professor Natsume's project                 will consider several specific problems in pursuit of this agenda               of looking at geometric phenomena through an operator-algebraic                 lens.",
