 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research                           project in electrical engineering between Zoran Andjelic,                       University of Sarajevo, and S.J. Salon, Rensselaer                              Polytechnic Institute, the investigators will develop a                         mathematical model and computer based programs for three                        dimensional nonlinear field modelling and optimization for                      3D electromagnetic field distribution of electrical                             devises.  Such a model will be used to determine the optimal                    performance of an electrical devise in the design stage or                      during operation.  The University of Sarajevo research team                     is expert in software development while the RPI group is                        experienced in code verification and data testing on large                      electrical equipment.                                                                                                                                           This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution  in Yugoslavia, but                        include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
