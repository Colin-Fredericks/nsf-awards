 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little is known about the process of long-term                                  reconstruction after damaging urban                                             earthquakes.  Large metropolitan earthquakes                                    are scattered over time and the globe in a way                                  that makes assembly and sharing of experiences                                  difficult.  Many U.S. metropolitan areas                                        including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Salt                                      Lake City, Seattle, Charleston, Memphis and                                     Boston face the prospect of a large magnitude                                   earthquake and the tasks of rebuilding.  Many                                   large cities throughout the world are also                                      subject to major earthquakes.  Yet few                                          planners, here or abroad, are aware of the                                      problems they may face or the resources                                         available to help before and after an                                           earthquake.                                                                                                                                                     Through this project an international                                           symposium will be organized to discuss                                          specific issues related to reconstruction                                       after urban earthquakes.  Planners or other                                     officials from cities around the world who                                      have planned for the rebuilding an earthquake-                                  damaged city will be invited to share                                           experiences with planners from vulnerable U.S.                                  cities and selected government officials and                                    researchers.  The aim is to learn from others'                                  experiences how to seize opportunities and                                      avoid pitfalls in planning for rebuilding                                       after large magnitude earthquakes.  Foreign                                     participants will have the opportunity to                                       learn first hand from each other.  In addition                                  they will have a chance to learn informally                                     what actions U.S. and foreign cities are                                        taking to reduce losses prior to an earthquake                                  and prepare for rebuilding.  A report                                           distilling the main points of the symposium                                     will be prepared to share the insights of                                       symposium participants with a wider audience.",
