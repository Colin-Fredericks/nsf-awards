 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in              modern mathematical analysis between Naza Tanovic-Miller of the                 University of Sarajevo and Martin Buntinas of the Loyola University             of Chicago.  The investigators will study the connections between               problems in Fourier analysis, summability theory and the theory of              topological sequence spaces.  These areas contribute to the                     interpretation, mathematical formulation and understanding of                   physical phenomena.                                                                                                                                             This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The grants are            composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to               Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
