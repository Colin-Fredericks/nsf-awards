 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical vapor decomposition (CVD) is one of the important                      techniques in the fabrication of semiconductor and compound                     semiconductor materials which are crucial in high speed                         electronics and supercomputer technology.  Barrel reactor is a                  commercial CVD reactor operating at atmospheric pressure or                     reduced pressure.  Unfortunately, uniformity in film deposition                 is a real concern in this reactor.  The flow patterns are three                 dimensional asymmetric.  The objectives of this proposed work are               as follows.  The first is to use state-of-the-art finite element                techniques in computational fluid dynamics to solve for the                     complex reactive flows in a barrel reactor.  Different finite                   element methods lead to different consistent mass matrices.  The                goal is to find an algorithm which provides an \"optimal\"                        consistent mass matrix with minimum numerical diffusion and                     spurious oscillation.  The developed algorithm will be used to                  study the effects of gas flow rates, suspector rotating speed,                  gas nozzle locations, substrate temperature and operating                       pressure on the deposition rate and uniformity of existing                      reactors.  It can also be used as a design tool for new gas                     distribution system and reactor design.",
