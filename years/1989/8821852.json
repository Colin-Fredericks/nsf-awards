 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research centers on measurement and substantive                    issues raised by the investigator's recently completed  book,                   The Measurement of Durable Goods Prices,  as well as by his newly               released data and estimates on real GNP covering the period 1869-               1908.  The primary focus will be on the low rate of productivity                growth in the U.S. private economy in the 1968-84 interval.  Many               of the conceptual and substantive questions involving the                       productivity slowdown are directly related to the series on                     durable goods prices,  particularly the role of computers and                   other electronic equipment in changing the quality of consumer                  and producer services in ways that do not enter present measures                of output.  In addition to exploring the implications of                        previously collected data,  the puzzle of slow productivity                     growth outside of manufacturing in the U.S. will be addressed by                developing new output measures for individual industries,                       studying the effects of different methods of measurement used in                other major OECD economies,  and searching for new data that may                reveal changes in the quantity and quality of services.  A                      secondary focus will be on issues raised by the historical                      research on GNP.  While the latter provided new measures only of                cyclical deviations of output from trend,  not of the trend                     itself,  it yet uncovered new data sources that will improve                    estimates of those trends.  Also, it revealed puzzling                          contradictions in the measurement of real output and prices in                  the important period after World War I,  1919-23,  which need to                be addressed by primary data.  Resolution of the conflict between               major indicators of the depth of the 1920-21 recession is                       extremely important in developing an understanding of what went                 wrong in 1929-33.  A third issue is the unsatisfactory state of                 price data during the period between the end of Rees' classic                   (1961) study and 1947, when the period covered by the durable                   goods book begins.   The overall significance of the improvements               in the historical as well as the more current indicators of                     economic activity is the increased capability they create for the               effective analysis of the central problems of macroeconomics.",
