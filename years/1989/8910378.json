 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most current research on optimal repair and replacement                    policies for machines operating in parallel does not utilize all                of the information that is available.  The purpose of this                      research is to provide repair and replacement policies that                     incorporate the dynamic information an engineer receives as the                 system is operating.                                                                 The second major direction of this research is to                          investigate the situation where the parameter of an underlying                  exponential failure time distribution is unknown.  A prior                      distribution for the unknown parameter is provided.  This                       distribution is continually updated as information on the                       performance of the machines is gathered.  A decision rule based                 on this updated information will be developed.  The novelty of                  this approach is that it incorporates Bayesian statistical                      inference together with the probabilistic reliability methods                   that have traditionally been used.",
