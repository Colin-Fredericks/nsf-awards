 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of three U.S.                         scientists in a workshop intended to lead to the creation of a                  European repository for late Quarternary pollen data, to be held                in Lund, Sweden in August 1989.  The workshop is co-organized by                Dr. G. L. Jacobson, University of Maine, and Dr. Bjorn E.                       Berglund, University of Lund, Sweden.                                                                                                                           Fossil-pollen data provide the principal evidence of variations                 in vegetation and climate during the past 20,000 years, and serve               as the major basis for reconstructing long-term climatic changes                and testing in paleoecological studies throughout Europe during                 the past half century.  Unfortunately, the information remains                  for the most part scattered among many laboratories in many                     countries.  Almost all quantitative approaches to climate                       reconstruction and model testing require access to the original                 data from individual sites, and there is urgent need for a single               repository for the European data.  Specific goals of this                       workshop are to reach agreements on (1) the location and                        administration of the databank; (2) who should have overall                     responsibility for its development and maintenance; (3) how data                in the repository can be most conveniently accessible to users;                 and (4) how contributors can retain appropriate control over what               is done with their data.  The major result of the workshop will                 be formal creation of European Data Repository, which will be                   comparable to the COHMAP database that was established at Brown                 University for North American data.",
