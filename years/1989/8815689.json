 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar, \"Biological Monitoring of                    Occupational Exposure\", organized jointly by Professor Vera Thomas of           the University of Miami School of Medicine and Prof. Masana Ogata of            the Okayama University Medical School, Japan.  Participants will meet           in Honolulu, Hawaii from August 22 to 25, 1989, to exchange information         on methods for biological monitoring of occupational exposure to                toxic chemicals in the U.S. and Japan, clarify factors which influence          biological levels of exposure indicators, discuss differences in                monitoring practices in the two countries, and promote sharing of               data, partially through establishing reference values for biological            monitoring.                                                                                                                                                     The seminar will bring together researchers affiliated with univer-             sities and governmental and industrial laboratories in the U.S. and             Japan.  Those invited are experts in fields related to biological               monitoring, including physicians, industrial hygienists, chemists,              and toxicologists.  In addition to sessions intended to instruct each           side on the monitoring practices of the other country, discussions              will be held on unifying monitoring data bases, and on the current              status of research on monitoring in each country.  Specific problems            of monitoring in the mining and semiconductor industries will also be           discussed.  This seminar should be valuable in helping scientists               bridge the gap between the usual air                                            measurements of toxic chemicals, and actual biological absorption.",
