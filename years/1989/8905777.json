There is a map f of the amalgamated free                    product into G; the smallest length of a non-trivial element of                 the kernal of f, in terms of the amalgamated free product                       structure, is an even number 2n.  The angle of (A,B;C) is                       defined to be pi/n.  We can now imagine that to each cell of a                  two-dimensional complex K there is associated a group, so that                  to each corner of a 2-cell there is associated a triad embedded                 in the vertex group.  Now, in some cases (for instance, when K                  is a triangle), we can define a \"non-spherical\" condition (if K                 is a triangle, this is simply the condition that the sum of the                 three group-theoretic angles is at most pi); and we can then                    prove that there is a big group H containing all the label                      groups of the 2-complex, and that this group has a K(H,1)                       complex which is constructed in a natural way.  This is proved                  by a topological construction, but there are more rigidly                       geometrical things underlying the situation, which lead to a                    more detailed understanding of the group H.  This work is very                  recent.  The project is to continue in this vein, to generalize                 to more complicated 2-complexes, to try to classify groups                      acting on \"piecewise-Euclidean 2-complexes of non-positive                      curvature,\" to generalize to higher-dimensional complexes in                    the spirit of Gromov's hyperbolic groups, to relate this to                     classical problems in combinatorical group theory, and to see                   where this theory leads.                                                             Groups are algebraic systems with a multiplication which                   satisfies a few natural rules.  (These rules are abstracted                     from groups of symmetries.)  The concept is ubiquitous in                       mathematics and theoretical physics, and any substantial                        advances in group theory are likely to be followed by a large                   audience and to have wide repercussions.",
