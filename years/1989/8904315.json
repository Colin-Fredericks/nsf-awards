 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand the fundamental                       role of malate metabolism in plant cells.  13C NMR                              spectroscopy is being used to determine the compartmentation                    of malate between cytoplasm and vacuole in maize root tips.                     These determinations are coupled with in vivo and in vitro                      measurements of malate synthesis, decarboxylation, vacuolar                     transport and the conversion of malate to other metabolites                     to obtain a comprehensive picture of the behavior of malate                     within the cell.  The results of these analyses will help                       establish 1) the extent to which malate (versus pyruvate) is                    the major metabolite utilized to drive the operation of the                     TCA cycle in plant mitochondria, 2) the role of malate in the                   regulation of PEP carboxylase activity in the cytoplasm and                     3) the interplay between cytosolic bicarbonate levels and                       malate metabolism in response to salt stress.%%%                                                                                                                Malic acid (malate) has long been recognized for its                            potential as a major intermediate compound associated with                      respiratory and related metabolisms in higher plant cells.                      However, the exact importance of malate has eluded precise                      clarification due to a lack of ability to measure malate and                    its rates of synthesis/breakdown within the intact cell.                        This project uses NMR spectroscopy, coupled with a series of                    more classical biochemical assays, to look at the levels.                       rates and directions of movement of malate within corn root                     tip cells to develop a precise picture of the role of malate                    in plant respiratory metabolism.  A better understanding of                     the function of malate in plant respiration should lead to a                    clearer picture of what factors act to regulate plant                           respiration and, ultimately, plant productivity.***",
