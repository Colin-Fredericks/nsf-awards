 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthetic Organic Program supports the work of Dr. Patrick.                 Patrick, professor of chemistry at SIUE, is carrying out                        research on the project, \"Monofluoro Reagents for Organic                       Synthesis\".  The replacement of a hydrogen atom by a fluorine                   can have remarkable effects on the chemical and biological                      behavior of the molecule.  Methods for carrying out these                       changes have been difficult.  Patrick is developing new ways to                 incorporate the fluorine atom into organic molecules.                                                                                                           Patrick is developing several new reagents for incorporating                    fluorine into relatively complex organic molecules.  This is                    accomplished primarily through the preparation of unique                        fluorinated synthons that can find general application in the                   development of synthetic strategies.  Specific target                           intermediates include fluorinated oxazines and oxazolines,                      masked carbonyl compounds that contain fluorine, and a                          fluorinated butadiene.  Successful completion of the                            preparation of these targets will provide a supply of general                   and versatile reagents that can be applied to the synthesis of                  fluorinated analogs of natural products.",
