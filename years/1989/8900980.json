 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy (CASA) will host                6-8-undergraduates for the summer of 1989. The students, half                   drawn from the University of Colorado (CU) and half drawn from                  other institutions in Colorado or adjacent states, will spend ten               weeks in a program designed to maximize both their educational                  and research experience.  The program will begin with an                        intensive, two-week training period in which students will be                   given a thorough overview of the facilities and research tools                  available at CASA, and will be introduced to the CASA faculty and               the available research projects.  By the end of the training                    period each student will choose, or be assigned to, an individual               research project under the guidance of a CASA scientist.                        Throughout the ten-week program, students will continue to meet                 for a daily seminar, entitled \"Research in Astrophysics\", for                   which they will receive three units of academic credit at the                   University of Colorado.  The seminar will present students with a               theoretical framework in relevant astrophysical topics, provide a               wide survey of the astrophysical research at CASA, and offer                    advice and guidance on graduate school or future careers in                     astrophysics' as a \"final exam\", students will present oral and                 written summaries of their own research.                                                                                                                        In summary, the Principal Investigators' program anticipates a                  progressive pattern of student activities.  Students begin by                   participating in CASA's  summer program, in which they will                     develop the background and skills needed for continued research                 success.  Following the summer program, it is hoped that students               will continue with independent support to the development of a                  senior thesis in astrophysics, which in turn can lead into a                    successful graduate experience and career.",
