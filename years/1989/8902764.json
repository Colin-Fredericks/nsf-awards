 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is to design and build an interactive system for high              speed electrical simulation of digital and analog circuits.                     Characteristics of the system are: simple to use, programmable, much            faster than highly optimized simulators, capable of hierarchical and            mixed mode simulation, and able to produce efficient code for parallel          processors.  Logical simulators have been greatly speeded up by                 compiling each circuit into a program to simulate that one circuit.             Still, each kind of simulation requires that a separate circuit                 compiler be written and debugged.  This research is extending this              methodology from logical to electrical simulation.  It is also general,         in that it compiles a pair consisting of a circuit and a conventional           interpretive simulator. The approach uses partial evaluators to do this         compilation.  Signals are implemented as real data values that can be           assigned to variables, be put in data structures, and be arguments to           signal processing functions. This allows a signal produced by a                 simulation to be used as a voltage or current source in a subsequent or         simultaneous simulation.                                                                                                                                        The proposed research is meritorious, relevant, and the approach is             innovative.  The prototype work of the P.I. is promising.  Simulation           is an important area, and the research will improve the state of the            art in electrical simulation, making a fundamental advance.  Results            could be applied to a wide variety of simulation programs and                   computationally intensive programs.  Professor Weise has already a              distinguished record of achievement in IC design simulation, and should         make significant contributions to the field.",
