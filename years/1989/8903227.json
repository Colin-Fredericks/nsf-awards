 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mr. Bruce Owen, a graduate student at the University of                         California, Los Angeles, will conduct excavations at two                        archaeological sites located in the lower Osmore valley in                      southern Peru.  The sites, El Algodonal and Loreto Viejo, were,                 on the basis of preliminary work, occupied between 300 and 1200                 A.D. and relate to the expansion of the Tiwanaku empire.  The                   massive site of Tiwanaku is located in the Bolivian highlands,                  and its influence extended far to the North into Peru.                          Archaeologists wish to understand how expansion occurred and how                outlying colonies, such as those in the lower Osmore valley,                    wereintegrated with the core area.  Such an examination will shed               light on how the empire functioned.                                                                                                                             Mr. Owen will conduct surface surveys at both sites.  With the                  information thus obtained, areas will be selected for careful                   excavation.  Data collected will allow reconstruction of the                    social organization of both groups.  The extent of status                       differential, for example, will be determined.  The economic                    basis of the communities will also be reconstructed and trade                   relations with the parent colony of Tiwanaku examined.  Analysis                of skeletal material will permit insight into the relationship                  between colonists and the local population.                                                                                                                     Because the Andes Mountains come close to the sea, this area of                 South America consists of narrow ecological zones which differ                  greatly in resources available.  Because foodstuffs are really                  limited, early empires were forced to devise complex strategies                 to both produce and redistribute goods and these can be discerned               in the archaeological record.  Thus, they can provide insight                   into how these empires functioned.  Mr. Owen's research will                    contribute to this goal.                                                                                                                                        The research is important because it will increase understanding                of the emergence of complex societies such as our own.  It will                 also facilitate the training of a highly competent, young                       scientist.",
