 "awd_abstract_narration": "C.V. Hollot's research interests are in the systems and control area.           In particular he is concerned with the performance evaluation and               control of uncertain dynamical systems; i.e., robust control.  His              objective is to develop techniques which are non-conservative -                 techniques which ensure system robustness without sacrificing system            performance.  To illustrate, consider a robotic arm which handles               payloads varying between one pound and a hundred pounds.  The payload           is uncertain and a control law based upon a nominal payload of one              pound may perform poorly (perhaps become unstable) when lifting the             one hundred pound payload.  One way to cope with this payload                   variation is to make the robot arm massive - this helps minimize the            relative impact of the payload.  However, this \"margin of safety\"               comes at the expense of performance - increased controller effort and           reduced response time.  Professor Hollot's research is aimed at                 reducing such conservatism.  He is developing analysis and design               techniques which exploit the complex manner in which uncertain                  parameters affect the behavior of differential equations.",
