 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Studies in Science, Technology and Society program supports                 research that examines the structures and processes that                        influence the direction and use of science and technology in                    their social, political, and economic contexts.  Ethics and                     Values Studies supports research that examines the social,                      professional and individual values and mutual obligations and                   responsibilities that arise in interactions of science,                         technology and society.  Research projects often examine social                 controversies surrounding impacts of or on sciences or                          technologies.  This research addresses a very important EVS issue               .. controversies surrounding the use of animals in research.                    Prior EVS.supported research on this issue has examined ethical                 foundations for views about animal experimentation, legal                       developments, and the views of Animal Care and Use Committees.                  The current research takes an empirical approach that will                      provide data and insight on (1) contrasting perceptions of the                  ethical dilemmas raised by animal experimentation and (2) the                   dynamics and impacts of these controversies on science,                         technology and society.  Assisted by an advisory group including                scientists and social theorists with different views of the                     merits of arguments for and against animal research, the two                    investigators will review scholarly as well as popular media                    accounts of animal rights and animal welfare concerns and                       activities; and they will interview and observe activists and                   scientists concerned with several crucial cases and new                         legislation and regulations concerning animal care and use.  The                research and analysis will focus on recruitment of members and                  supporters to different factions in the controversy, evolution of               the organizations and tactical choices, and effects on scientific               research.  Results will include a series of articles for                        researchers, STS scholars and policy makers, and a book directed                at the wider public that is interested in these issues.                                                                                                         This project will contribute to professional and public                         discussion of issues surrounding uses of animals in research.                   The investigators are very well.qualified; results from prior                   support of the co.principal investigator have been timely,                      informative and well.received.  Institutional support is                        adequate and costs are reasonable.  Total support in the amount                 of $80,705 is recommended.",
