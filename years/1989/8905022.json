 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cytokeratin filaments from a major cytoskeletal system in the                   Xenopus oocyte and early embryo. Using wholemount                               immunocytochemistry Dr. klymkowsky has discovered a dramatic                    asymmetry in the organization of cytokeratin filaments in both                  the oocyte and early embryo. During oocyte maturation cytokeratin               filaments break down. Cytokeratin breakdown appears to be                       regulated post-translationally and is induced by maturation                     promoting factor (MPF). Dr. Klymkowsky will determine whether MPF               acts directly or indirectly to disrupt cytokeratin organization                 using an in vitro assay system. With fertilization cytokeratin                  filaments reform; this asymmetrically organized embryonic                       cytokeratin system persists until the end of gastrulation. To                   define the function of cytokeratin filaments in the embryo, he                  will develop new monoclonal anticytokeratin antibodies. The                     epitopes of these antibodies will be mapped on the cytokeratin                  protein and its effects on cytokeratin filament integrity and                   embryonic development will be determined. This will enable him to               define regions of the cytokeratin molecule involved in                          cytokeratin filament organization and function. Dr. Klymkowsky                  has already identified two monoclonal anticytokeratin antibodies                that specifically disrupt normal gastrulation in Xenopus. To                    define further the mechanism by which these                                     antibodies act, he will use light and electron microscopy to                    characterize the movement and morphology of cells during                        gastrulation and immunocytochemistry to examine cytokeratin                     organization within the embryo. Injection of antibodies into                    specific blastomeres will be used to determine the regions of the               gastrulating embryo affected by these antibodies. Together these                studies offer an opportunity for defining the functions of                      cytokeratins, understanding how their organization if controlled                and for furthering our understanding of the major morphogenetic                 event of vertebrate development, gastrulation.                                  %%%                                                                             One of the most dramatic events during the maturation of the egg                in the amphibian, Xenopus is the reorganization of the                          subcellular cytokeratin-type intermediate filaments. The                        resulting mature egg is asymmetric and this asymmetry defines the               axis of the mature organism. Clearly the events leading to the                  setting up of this polarity are key events in development.",
