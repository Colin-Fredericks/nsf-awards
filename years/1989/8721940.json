 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Optimal Control Studies for Steamflooding\" between            Dr. W. Fred Ramirez of the University of Colorado at Boulder and                Professor Qi Yufeng of the Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration          and Development (RIPED) of China, is jointly sponsored by NSF and               RIPED.                                                                                                                                                          The investigators propose to use optimal control theory to determine            operating strategies that maximize the economic attractiveness of the           steamflooding enhanced oil recovery process.  Because the computation           of optimal injection strategies is a stringent test of the usability            of the mechanistic model which describes the physical process, the              evaluation of optimization results with optimal control theory helps            develop adequate predictive mathematical models for new enhanced oil            recovery techniques.  For the steamflooding process, the investigators          will consider the optimal use of foam drives.  They also will                   investigate for the first time the effect of reservoir heterogeneties           and fractures on optimal injection strategies.  To the best of their            knowledge, the principal investigators are the only ones currently              applying optimal control theory to oil recovery problems.  By                   combining superior computational facilities in the US with the                  Chinese' superior mathematical model, the investigators hope to                 advance a solution of this new optimal control problem.",
