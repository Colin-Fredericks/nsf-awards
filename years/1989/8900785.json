 "awd_abstract_narration": "An REU site project will focus on the use of advanced                      computational experimentation to expose undergraduate researchers               to a variety of current mathematical research frontiers.                             A program to carry out numerical experiments on the                        qualitative behavior of solutions of nonlinear evolution                        equations and elliptic systems will be available.  Studies of                   asymptotic behavior of solutions to the porous medium equation                  represents one specific area.  Numerical data obtained will                     amplify recent theoretical results on uniqueness for extremal                   functions in the Sobolev inequality.                                                 Other work will concentrate on the phi-transform, a new                    technique developed for decomposing general functions into sums                 of simple terms.  It is based on important advances in harmonic                 analysis in the last twenty years.  In addition to being                        relatively easy to understand, this transform exhibits certain                  speed characteristics of the fast Fourier transform.  Properties                of the transform make it useful in numerical work; understanding                these properties is a task well suited for undergraduate                        research.                                                                            Student interns will also be involved in the creation of                   numerical models for calculation of automorphism groups for                     domains in the space of several complex variables.  This highly                 theoretical field lends itself to numerical interpretation                      through certain boundary differential quantities known as the                   Chern-Moser-Tanaka invariants.  Tedious calculations necessary to               put the boundary of a domain in normal form can now be carried                  out.  Students will develop the basic algebra and symbol                        manipulation algorithms which will be needed, learning about the                complex mathematical structures and their analysis                              simultaneously.",
