 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study problems arising in the                        classification of foliated manifolds (as represented by the                     homotopy type of foliation classifying spaces),  and how the                    analytic structures (the analytic K-theory and spectral theory)                 associated to elliptic operators along the leaves of a foliation                are related to the algebraic topology of the ambient manifold.                  This project will study the role of global topology in the                      spectral properties of foliation operators, especially regarding:               leafwise eta-invariants and odd analytic K-theory; Chern                        characters and asymptotic methods for transverse operators; gap                 phenomenon for leafwise Schrodinger operators based on                          generalizing Brillouin zone theory of solid state physics via                   Fourier integral operator methods.                                                   Recent work of T. Tsuboi has introduced a new method for the               study of the algebraic topology of the Haefliger classifying                    spaces of foliations.  The investigator hopes to extend the                     approach of Tsuboi to make a comprehensive study of how the                     cohomology of a classifying space is related to the dynamics of                 the foliation groupoids that it classifies, and to their                        transverse differentiability.  He intends to continue his                       research into the application of the transverse cyclic cohomology               invariants of Anosov foliations to providing rigidity phenomena                 for Riemannian manifolds with negative sectional curvatures.                         The classical foliation problem is whether one can comb the                hair on a cocoanut (without whorls).  Vast generalizations of                   this have been conceived and elaborate algebraic and analytic                   machinery evolved for treating them.  Still the underlying ideas                have a natural appeal to geometric intuition which gives a                      special flavor to the entire subject and inclines one to bear                   with its many technicalities.",
