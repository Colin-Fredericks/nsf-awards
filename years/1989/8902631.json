 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Gary Feinman, Ms. Susan Kepecs will                  conduct her doctoral dissertation research in the Chikinchel                    region of the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.  In this                             archaeological research, she will conduct a surface survey to                   locate large sites which were occupied during Early and Late                    Postclassic periods.  From these a group will be drawn for more                 intensive analysis.  Small settlements and other features will be               surveyed and mapped.  Surface distributions of elite                            architecture, housemounds, trade goods, and other remains will be               plotted.  Subsequent analysis will reveal relationships between                 architectural indicators of social class and the remains of                     economic activities.  Through a comparison of Early and                         succeeding Late Postclassic sites, it will be possible to                       determine how economic and related social organization changed                  over time.                                                                                                                                                      Archaeologists have long been interested in the \"decline\" of the                Mayan empire.  The Classic period saw the construction of temples               and other major monuments and associated large scale ceremonial                 activity.  In the succeeding Early and Late Postclassic periods,                these large centers were abandoned and the population dispersed                 into smaller groups.  Traditionally this has been interpreted as                a \"decline.\"  However, others argue that what is involved is a                  change in economic organization characterized by decentralization               and increasing economic competition between groups.  Because                    economic and social organization during the Postclassic period                  have not been well examined, it is not possible to choose between               these two options.  Ms. Kepecs research will provide much needed                data.                                                                                                                                                           A major goal of archaeology is to understand the processes which                lead to the rise and decline of complex societies.  The Mayan                   case has provided a textbook example of social decline and many                 researchers have attempted both to discover the cause and to                    generalize to other societies.  Ms. Kepecs' research is important               because it will shed additional light on this question.",
