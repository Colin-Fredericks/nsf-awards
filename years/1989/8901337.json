 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates award gives                        continuing support to The Whitney Laboratory, a research                        institute of the University of Florida, located on the Atlantic                 Coast, to provide research training for undergraduates in cell                  and neurobiology using marine animals.  Eight faculty members                   will train students throughout the year in modern, experimental                 techniques of anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and               electrophysiology for which the facility is exceptionally well                  equipped.  Students are recruited nationwide, and special efforts               are made to attract women and minority students, and students in                humanities departments who may be encouraged to try science as a                career.  The students will live on the campus of the laboratory,                have access to all facilities, and will become full partners in                 the ongoing research efforts of their faculty advisors.  Their                  independence will be encouraged, and they will receive full                     credit for their work in publications.  In addition to their                    practical research training, the students' intellectual growth                  will be stimulated through participation in the Laboratory's                    regular seminar series, a special student seminar series, and                   research discussions provided by each member of the faculty.",
