The IAB is                     responsible to the Federal Research Internet Coordinating Council               (FRICC) comprising members from government agencies concerned                   with scientific research: Defense Advanced Research Projects                    Agency, National Air and Space Administration, National                         Institutes for Health, Department of Energy, and National Science               Foundation.  The IAB manages the evolution of the Government                    Research Internet which continues to expand to more and more                    institutions including government laboratories and academic                     research institutions each year.  This rapid growth has been                    stimulated in large measure by the NSFNET, Regional networks, and               Supercomputer Center initiatives sponsored by NSF.                                                                                                                The secretariat will assist the IAB in carrying out its                       responsibilities, including development and adoption of new                     Internet Standards, short and mid-term engineering of the                       Internet, identification of pressing research areas and long term               transitions to standard international protocols and super high                  speed networks.  The dedicated support is essential to maintain                 and improve the utility of the research Internet and the research               infrastructure it provides to U. S. scientists and engineers.   //",
