 "awd_abstract_narration": "An undergraduate research program has been established involving about          one-half of the college's graduates each year.  This program was                developed after thorough review and revision of the curriculum.  To             implement the program and perform research on a variety of topics of            interest, the department will purchase a research quality light                 microscope for study of cells, tissues, plankton, and chromosomes, a            horizontal laminar flow hood and inverted microscope for cell and               tissue culture studies, a low temperature freezer for storage of a              variety of materials used in cell, tissue, and biochemical studies, and         a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system for analysis of          red oak flavonoids and bacterial toxins.  The equipment will be housed          in the research lab to be used by undergraduates.  The department will          now be able to offer high-quality research experience, a key                    ingredient in undergraduate science education.                                                                                                                  The college will provide 50% matching funds.",
