 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the study of basic problems                 in universal algebra and lattice theory. The specific areas of                  investigation will be the study of the complexity of certain                    algorithms in finitely presented lattices; modular congruence                   varieties; the determination of a common generalization to                      Ore's and Jonsson's theorems on direct decompositions;                          development of a computer algebra system dealing with finitely                  presented lattices; and projective planes over prime fields.                         Lattices are discrete mathematical objects with a                          structure reflecting to some extent the structure of set theory                 or logic. This very weak structure means that lattices can be                   found in many mathematical environments. It also means that                     problems are easy to state, difficult to solve and of a very                    general nature.",
