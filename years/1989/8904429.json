 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the physiology of the maternal-fetal                  relationship in developing embryos.  The elasmobranchs (sharks, skates          and rays) are used since they represent a relatively simple system              compared to the more complex mammals and humans.  The mother, to varying        degrees, provides oxygen and nutrients as well as for the removal of            wastes for embryos developing in the uterus.  This study will promote a         better understanding of the movements of oxygen and carbon dioxide              between the mother and embryo, and the mechanisms by which these gases          move across tissues in general.  Nitrogenous wastes accumulate in the           fluids bathing the embryo, and must be eliminated.  The manner by which         waste products such as ammonia and urea are detoxified and transported          will be better understood.  Lastly, salts are also regulated by the             mother, until the embryo may regulate for itself.  The role of the              various organs involved in the regulation of salt (kidney, gills and            rectal gland) will be described as well as the mechanisms by which salt         is transported across tissues.  The information gained in this study            will be used to provide a model to describe the physiology of the               maternal-fetal relationship.",
