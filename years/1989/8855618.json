 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomical telescope and image processing system will be developed for        educational use.  This \"MicroObservatory\" will be designed to be used           for classroom instruction by teachers as well as for original scientific        research projects by students.  It could also be used by the public in          planetariums and science museums.  By adding the recently developed             powerful technologies of CCD optical detectors and of microcomputers to         a small optical telescope, it will be possible to produce a self-               contained, integrated and user-friendly astronomical telescope and image        processing system.  These are the technologies in the forefront of              research in optical astronomy, yet costs have decreased enough to allow         these technologies to reach into the schools in the next few years.             Probably in no other area of frontier science would it be possible for a        broad spectrum of high school students (not just the gifted) to have            access to state-of-the-art technologies which would allow them to do            original research.  We see several important additions to the American          scientific educational enterprise by the development and broad                  dissemination of the MicroObservatory:  (1) For the large number of             earth science, physical science, physics and astronomy courses taught in        the schools, this would be a system which would allow for astronomical          observations in the daytime when students are in school, making                 astronomy a laboratory science like others in the schools.  (2) Students        themselves could undertake a wide range of research projects which would        allow them to learn by doing rather than just by reading, listening to          lectures or performing standard laboratory exercises.  (3) Students             would develop a variety of skills, from computer programming, to image          processing, to data analysis, to planning and designing of their own            original projects.  The proposed program includes construction of               prototype systems from off-the-shelf components for use in area schools;        development of teaching and research activities; design of the                  production MicroObservatory; and evaluation and testing throughout the          two year project.",
