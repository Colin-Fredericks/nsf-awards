 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme which catalyzes the                             interconversion of the two forms of inorganic carbon, carbon                    dioxide and bicarbonate ion, which predominate under                            physiological conditions.  In various species of unicellular                    green algae, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, one or more                   forms of carbonic anhydrase are critical components of an                       inorganic carbon concentrating system which allows these                        organisms to efficiently utilize the low levels of ambient                      carbon dioxide which would otherwise limit their growth.                        This project investigates the nature of the structure of the                    extracellular form of carbonic anhydrase in Chlamydomonas                       reinhardtii in vivo an in vitro and examines the effect of                      this structure on the catalytic properties of the enzyme.                       The localization of the extracellular enzyme in C.                              reinhardtii will be more clearly defined by chemical cross-                     linking and direct cellular binding studies.  In addition,                      the stabilization, purification and localization of the                         intracellular form(s) of the enzyme will be investigated.                                                                                                       These studies are critical in terms of identifying the                          components, and describing the details of the mechanism by                      which Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is able to efficiently                          concentrate inorganic carbon to provide carbon dioxide for                      photosynthesis.  It is potentially useful for improving                         photosynthetic capacity of crop plants.***//",
