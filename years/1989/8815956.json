 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar, \"Earthquake Resistant Design of              Reinforced Concrete Beam-Column Joints,\" organized jointly by Prof.             James O. Jirsa of the University of Texas, Austin, and Prof. Hiroyuki           Aoyama of the University of Tokyo, Japan.  Participants will meet in            Honolulu, Hawaii, from May 24 to 26, 1989, to report results of                 research programs under way in both the U.S. and Japan, and to                  discuss the implications of those results to the design of structures.          In this meeting structure designers have been invited in addition to            pure earthquake researchers, in order to facilitate rapid transfer of           conclusions into practice, and to assist in the evaluation of                   research data.                                                                                                                                                  The seminar will bring together researchers in the field from the               U.S. and Japan, with some observers from both countries and from New            Zealand.  Thus, continuity with several earlier joint seminars                  involving participants from those countries with the strongest                  efforts in the field, viz. the U.S., Japan, and New Zealand, is                 assured. This seminar will concentrate on the previously little-con-            sidered problem of beam-to-column connections, and will be important,           therefore, in assisting the rapid development and utilization of                techniques for earthquake resistant, reinforced-concrete construction.",
