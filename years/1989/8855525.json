 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight museums in the Greater Boston area have collaborated to                   help 96 elementary teachers from cooperating school districts                   improve their overall science literacy and their ability to                     transmit such literacy to the children that they teach.  The                    summer institute and school year followup program has created                   a professional partnership between classroom teachers and the                   diverse resources of the museums, both staff and collections.                   Such partnerships contribute to the development of greater                      knowledge of the processes and content of science as well as                    heighten the excitement and improve attitudes towards science                   by both teachers and their students.                                                                                                                            Key summer activities focus upon helping teachers understand                    the commonalities among diverse scientific fields that make                     each field \"science\", and developing understanding of the                       nature of inquiry and ways to foster it among children in                       school and out.  Teachers also have the opportunities to                        actually \"do\" science and to broaden their informational                        background in an area of science of their choosing, since                       they select the museum in which they will study.  Throughout                    the school year a variety of programs help the teachers with                    lesson planning, resource consultation, loan materials, and                     other support activities.  The approach is perceived as a                       potential model for expanded collaborations among museums and                   schools in New England and elsewhere around the nation.                                                                                                         An amount equivalent to 28% of the NSF request has been cost                    shared by private foundations, museums and school districts.//",
