 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the initial hydrolysis of                               triacylglycerols to fatty acids in seeds.  Lipase catalyzes                     the first step in the overall gluconeogenesis and thus may be                   the rate-controlling, and there is evidence that its action                     is subjected to internal and external controls.  The                            triacylglycerols surrounded by a half-unit membrane.  In this                   project, the specific binding between the maize lipase and                      lipid bodies will be probed.  Their recognition signals will                    be studied by different biochemical methods and by analyses                     of the protein structures via their amino acid sequences.                       Site-directed mutagenesis of the proteins will also be                          performed to complement the above studies in pinpointing the                    binding sites.  The general pattern of the findings on maize                    will be extended to cotton lipases.%%%                                                                                                                          Seed germination and post germinative growth represent an                       active and dynamic period of the life cycle.  The system                        offers an ideal opportunity for the study of metabolism and                     development.  The most prominent aspect of metabolism in seed                   germination is the mobilization of food reserves to support                     the growth of the embryo.  In the storage tissues of seeds,                     three major food reserves are present; namely, lipids,                          protein, and starch.  Most seeds contain a sizable amount of                    lipids, with notable exception in cereal grains.  Even in                       cereals, some (2-5% of seed weight) storage lipid is present                    in various parts of the grains, depending on the species and                    variety.  Lipids are good food storage in seeds since on a                      per volume basis they possess about twice as much energy as                     starch or proteins.  The storage lipid is mobilized to                          provide carbon skeleton and energy for growing embryonic                        axis.  This project supports studies on how lipids are                          utilized in seeds.***//",
