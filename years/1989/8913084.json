 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research                 project between Dr. Thomas Kerlin and Dr. Janox Valko of the                    Central Research Institute for Physics, Budapest, is to draw upon               long-term output data  from several hundred instrument channels of              a Hungarian Paks pressurized water reactor to determine baseline                behavior of the power plant.  The researchers intend to consider                these data along with those of a reactor noise diagnostic system to             further advance signal processing techniques useful in monitoring               plant subsystems and detecting maloperation.  The expected                      theoretical and implementable results of this collaboration should              yield new information on:  1) behavior of reactor process signals;              2) cause of variations in plant signatures; 3) use of signal                    fluctuating components for instrument fault monitoring; and 4) use              of non-invasive tests for component surveillance and preventive                 maintenance.                                                                                                                                                    This project in engineering systems fulfills the program objective              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in                the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                   talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                   interest and competence.",
