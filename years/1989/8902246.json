 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is one of determining the                        structure of differential operators from information about the                  spectrum of the operator.  In non-mathematical terms, this means                that one is attempting to reconstruct an object (such as an                     obstruction to a flow) or a force field from data obtained by                   remote observations.  This particular work will concentrate on                  reconstruction from quantum backscattering data.  Several issues                arise.  First, there is the question of whether or not sufficient               information is available for the reconstruction, whether the                    resulting potential (the object sought) is uniquely determined                  and the problem of reconstructing the potential by some practical               means.                                                                               Much of the work is a continuation of efforts to understand                the three-dimensional Schroedinger equation.  This equation has                 been studied extensively in one dimension.  In three dimensions,                the obstacles to progress are much greater, and it is only                      recently that mathematical research in the area has shown any                   progress.  Solutions are given in terms of a pure exponential                   part plus a term which is recovered from knowledge of the                       physical properties of the problem - the scattering amplitude.                  The inverse scattering problem consists of recovering the                       potential part of the Schroedinger equation from the scattering                 amplitude.  An immediate problem one encounters is that the                     inverse problem is over-determined; one is forced to characterize               those scattering amplitudes which can arise from three-                         dimensional potentials.                                                              One procedure currently under investigation is to restrict                 the scattering amplitude (normally defined on five-dimensional                  space) to three-dimensional manifolds.  One of these is the                     so-called backscattering data.  This choice has led to reasonably               good progress in those cases where the potential is known to be                 small.  The present work will continue along the same vein.  A                  primary objective is to define the proper function classes which                will give a controlled, well-defined backscattering map.  In                    addtion, work will continue on related issues of finding minimal                data sets necessary to solve the inverse problem, specifying the                range of the inverse map and showing that the Frechet derivative                of the map is invertible.",
