 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to recommence an NSF Research                         Experience for Undergraduates Site at the Cold Spring Harbor                    Laboratory.  To encourage the development of young scientists in                the field in the field of biology, the Undergraduate Research                   Program at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has, since 1959,                       annually sponsored between ten to twenty undergraduates from                    throughout the United States for an intensive ten-week long                     summer research experience.  The students are housed on grounds                 and each one is assigned to a permanent Laboratory staff member                 to perform an independent research project in the mentor's field                of expertise.  Each student begins his or her project with the                  advisor's close guidance and is subsequently encouraged to work                 independently.  This allows students to develop to their full                   potential and to sample first hand the excitement of experimental               science.  During the program the students present two series of                 seminars: one in which the students describe their proposed                     research and a final series in which the results of each project                are summarized.  There is also a series of seminars specifically                for the undergraduates in addition to daily lectures given as                   part of the Laboratory series of post-graduate biology courses.                 This undergraduate research program is very oversubscribed and,                 therefore, focuses on selection of individuals who, with proper                 direction, are likely to make a serious contribution to science                 in their ensuing careers.  Particular emphasis is placed on                     recruiting women and minorities who might otherwise not have an                 opportunity to experience such a scientifically active                          environment.  The success of the program is evidenced by the                    number of past participants who have become eminent scientists.",
