 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to investigate the                         petrographic and palynologic characteristics, surficial processes               of formation, and early stages of coalification (peatification)                 of several contrasting wet-tropical, peat deposits in the                       Caribbean region.  This data will be compared and contrasted with               data generated previously from temperate settings, such as the                  Okefenokee Swamp of Georgia, and Snuggedy Swamp of South                        Carolina.                                                                            Three tropical deposits have been selected for study:  1)                  the Moin Deposit of Costa Rica; 2) the Changuinola Deposit of                   Panama; and 3) the Arecibo Deposit of Puerto Rico.  Although all                of these are found in the same general type of setting, each                    exhibits one or more significant differences from the others and                was selected because it is expected to yield new and essential                  information with which to interpret and predict the composition                 and geometry of the many ancients coals that have been reported                 in the literature to have formed in tropical shoreline-related                  settings.                                                                            Methodology to be employed in this study will include:  1)                 field measurements of pH, salinity and other surface conditions;                2) field descriptions of peat sequences; 3) collection of surface               litter and surface samples; 4) collection of oriented piston                    cores; 5) transmitted, reflected, and fluorescent light                         microscopy from microtome thin sections; 6) low temperature                     ashing and x-ray analysis of surface and subsurface samples                     combined with radiocarbon dating, for interpreting the                          paleoecological and developmental history of the deposits.",
