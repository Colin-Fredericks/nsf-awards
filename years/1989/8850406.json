 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goals of the project are to improve the quality of                     mathematics and engineering education available to American                     Indian youth. The project proposes a model program consisting                   of a teacher workshop to be held concurrently with a camp for                   students at the middle school level, grades 6 through 8. The                    camp for students is to be funded from non National Science                     foundation funds, namely from AISES (American Indian Science                    and Engineering Society.) It is planned that 25 mathematics                     teachers attend workshops during the summers 1989 and 1990 at                   the Colorado School of Mines. The workshops emphasize                           mathematics and computer applications and improvement of                        teaching skills. Arising out of the workshop would be a                         tangible product in the form of a math kit which would be                       used in the schools and aid in transfer of knowledge and                        skills. The kit is to include culturally relevant,                              mathematically challenging lesson plans, manipulatives,                         computer software techniques, and reviews. Teachers and                         students are to benefit from constructive interaction and                       hands-on exercises during the training period. Funding for a                    prototype project to be conducted during the summer 1988 has                    already been funded by Cray Research, Incorporated. It is                       intended that the participants would become master teachers,                    as a product of the workshop experiences, who would be                          capable of helping other teachers in their districts. Through                   this mechanism, potentially hundreds of teachers and                            thousands of students should be impacted by the project. The                    process of participant selection is based on cooperative work                   by the College and AISES. The latter will advertise the                         workshop to American Indian schools using an existing mailing                   list to alert the school and community populations. Criteria                    used by AISES to judge applications includes evidence of                        need, commitment to teaching in an American Indian school,                      administrative support to ensure application of workshop                        training, and the teacher's willingness to adopt innovative                     approaches to the teaching of mathematics. There is to be an                    education selection committee comprised of educators and                        professionals in science and engineering which will select                      the participants from among the applicants. The emphasis                        during the workshop experiences for teachers is on teaching                     techniques, mathematics content, and computer content. A                        discovery learning process is to be utilized to invite                          teachers to more fully engage the academic subjects on which                    they may have deficiencies. The mathematics emphasis is on                      the development of algebraic and geometric thought utilizing                    spatial visualization and diagrammatic models.  The computer                    classes involve literacy as well as programming techniques                      using the BASIC and Logo languages.                                                                                                                             The staff seems to have excellent knowledge of the academic                     and didactical topics as well as experiences in working with                    the target populations.                                                                                                                                         An amount equivalent to 61% of the NSF request has been cost                    shared by the university, public and private institutions.",
