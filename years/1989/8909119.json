 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is the study of states that lead to               turbulence in buoyancy-driven flows.  The competition between                   dissipation (viscosity or conduction) and forces caused by gradients            of thermodynamic variables (temperature or concentration) drives the            system away from equilibrium and creates spatial and temporal patterns          (bifurcations).  Attention is focused on two classes of two-component           systems:  fluid-saturated packed beds and non-reacting binary fluids.           Driven dissipative two-component fluid systems are most frequently              encountered in nature or in modern technological applications of the            physical and chemical sciences and are associated with energy                   production and transport.  The investigation hinges on the assumption           of two-dimensional models of convection.  Such models are not only              simple, they are realistic as well.                                                                                                                             The project consists of two tasks:  (1) studying the fundamentals of            fluid convection in coarse packed beds by performing stability                  analysis (Problem                                                               interstitial circulation on a parallel computer (Problem                        numerically investigating onset and pattern formation during natural            convection in thin annuli filled with mixtures of binary fluids                 (Problem",
