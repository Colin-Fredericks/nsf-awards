 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to characterize the                           relationship between synaptic structure and function in the                     cardiac ganglion of the frog \u001aXenopus laevis.\u001a                                                                                                                  Each parasympathetic neuron in the ganglion is innervated by an                 axon which deposits several synaptic boutons on its cell body.                  Extracellular recording techniques will be used to monitor the                  release of transmitter from individual synaptic boutons.  Voltage               clamp techniques will be used to measure the quantum content, \u001am,\u001a              and to calculate the number of quanta available for release, \u001an,\u001a               which will be compared to the number of active zones.                                                                                                           The total number of synaptic boutons on the ganglion cell body is               correlated with target cell size in adults.  Voltage clamp                      techniques will be used to learn whether inputs with more                       synaptic boutons elicit proportionately more synaptic current                   when stimulated.  The functional significance of the observed                   parallel increase in both cell size and bouton number during                    postmetamorphic growth will be assessed, again with voltage clamp               techniques.  If transmitter release from individual boutons                     elicits a constant amount of synaptic current, regardless of the                stage of growth, then synaptic boutons presumably represent                     functional units of synaptic growth.                                                                                                                            These studies should increase our understanding of the                          relationship between the structure, function and growth of                      interneuronal synapses.",
