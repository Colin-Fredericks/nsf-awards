 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Interactive Video Science Consortium is a non-profit group of               fifteen science centers and museums that proposes to develop interactive        video exhibits about Earth and Planetary sciences with two purposes in          mind.  One, the video exhibits on the two subject areas will serve as           educational vehicles for four million visitors, representing the                combined audiences of the fifteen participating museums.  Two, through          extensive testing and visitor research during the development process           the consortium members will enlarge understanding of the appropriate and        effective uses of the interactive video medium in science museums.              Consortium members will fund the costs of conducting research on the            subject matter and producing the first two discs.  The request to the           National Science Foundation is for the systematic analysis of the               effectiveness of this type of program and of the educational impact of          the medium in science museums.",
