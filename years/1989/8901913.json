These networks often involve oscillating subnetworks                 or cells interacting with other oscillators or non-oscillating                  neurons.  One of the most studied C.P.G.'s is a network that is                 roughly configured as a chain of oscillators.  One goal of the                  mathematics is to intuit and test conjectures about general                     kinds of constraints on the connectivity, in order that the                     network be able to function appropriately.  The current effort                  builds on former results and focuses on three areas:  (1) the                   role of long-range coupling in the network, (2) the                             construction of networks not composed of modular oscillatory                    subpieces, but behaving like chains of discrete oscillators,                    (3) the interaction of the neural activity of the C.P.G. with                   the mechanical activity that it directs.  In addition, work is                  proposed on issues arising from small invertebrate network                      C.P.G.'s.  The focus of that work is to relate properties of                    the cells to emergent properties of the network.  All work is                   to be done in coordination with experimentalists.  Finally,                     some purely mathematical topics are proposed.",
