 "awd_abstract_narration": "A doctoral student will conduct an eighteen-month study on                 the feeding ecology and behavior of the aye-aye (Daubentonia                    madagascariensis), a nocturnal primate endemic to the island of                 Madagascar.  No long term field studies have previously been                    conducted on this animal.  The aye-aye has a considerable number                of unique morphological characteristics, including a filiform                   middle finger on the hand, continuously growing incisor teeth,                  inguinal mammary glands, the largest brain size relative to body                size of any prosimian primate, and it is the only Malagasy                      primate that is sexually dimorphic in body size.  Its nocturnal                 and insectivorous habits set it apart from other primates of                    similar body weight.                                                                                                                                                 Like humans, the aye-aye has a significantly larger brain                  for its body size than closely related species.  Since a large                  brain size may allow for more complex sensorimotor processes,                   permitting the exploitation of stationery or hidden foods not                   available to other species, Daubentonia and humans may each                     differ from closely related primates in their greater capacity to               exploit difficult-to-access resources.  Studies on the aye-aye's                relationship to its environment may contribute to our search for                general principles pertinent to the development of human social                 behavior.  Since the aye-aye is one of the most endangered                      species of primates in the world, study of its behavior and                     ecology are of extreme importance in developing conservation                    management plans for this unique species.",
