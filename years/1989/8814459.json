 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between U.S. and                 British computer scientists in the area of the formal specification             of software systems.  The U.S. investigator is Dr. Stephen Fickas;              the British researchers involved are Dr. Alan Bundy, Department of              Artificial Intelligence, University of Edinburgh, and Dr. Anthony               Finkelstein, Computer Science Department, Imperial College of                   Science and Technology, London.  The construction of a complete and             consistent software specification is critical to modern software                engineering methodologies.  At the same time, a characterization of             the construction process itself remains an open research question.              In essence, formal specifications to drive our implementation                   systems are needed, but the means of constructing such                          specifications in any disciplined manner are still lacking.  The                principal investigator proposes to collaborate with two U.K.                    research groups, one at the University of Edinburgh and one at                  Imperial College, London, in an effort to both formalize and                    automate a model of specification design.                                                                                                                       Up until this time, each of the three groups has focused on a                   different aspect of the specification problem:  Edinburgh has                   focused on mapping from informal descriptions to formal                         specifications.  Imperial College has focused on identifying                    necessary specification activities, and tracking the dependencies               among them; the principal investigator has focused on                           knowledge-based approaches to specification analysis.  Dr. Fickas,              in cooperation with the two U.K. groups, will lead an effort to                 integrate the three approaches into a more general model of                     specification construction.  The results will be twofold.  First,               the integration attempt itself will force each of other three                   current models to become more refined.  Second, Dr. Fickas plans to             incorporate parts of the Edinburgh and Imperial models into his                 existing computer-based system, thus providing further extensions               to an automated tool for specification construction.",
