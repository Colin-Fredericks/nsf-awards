 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports the U. S. component of a                    cooperative project by Dr. C. N. R. Rao, Professor, Solid                       State and Structural Chemistry Unit of the Indian Institute                     of Science, Bangalore, with Dr. John Honig, Materials                           Research Center, Purdue University.  The research covers                        development of novel oxide materials with special focus on                      high temperature superconductors.  The work includes                            synthesis of interesting oxide systems and examination of                       structure-property relations. It also includes the discovery                    of new classes of oxides with unusual electronic and magnetic                   properties, including the very inportant property of                            superconductivity at relatively high temperatures.  This                        project is a renewal of research that Drs. Honig and Rao                        carried under earlier NSF grants.                                                                                                                               Scope:  The collaboration of Professor Rao's team at                            Bangalore and Professor Honig's team at Purdue has been                         successful and resulted in a significant number of                              publications.  Rao is one of India's most distinguished                         scientists.  He has done pioneering research in numerous                        areas of materials and structural chemistry.  It is likely                      that this project will result in significant advances in the                    field of new materials and better material characterization.                    Dr. Honig is a participant in a newly established Indiana                       Center for Innovative Superconductivity Technology, which was                   provided $500,000 for the first year of operation by the                        State of Indiana.  His work with Dr. Rao would fit well with                    the objectives of that center, and with enhancing materials                     science research in the U. S.",
