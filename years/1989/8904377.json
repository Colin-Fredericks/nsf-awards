 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Ridgway and Freeman have recently discovered that the eggs                 and embryos of several species of hydrozoans contain endogenous                 calcium indicators similar to aequorin. Because the calcium                     indicators are natural, exist in high concentration, and emit                   light specifically in the presence of calcium, these preparations               offer unique opportunities for studying the role of calcium in                  early development. They propose to investigate the mechanism that               controls the appearance of calcium channels in the membrane at                  first cleavage in these organisms. These channels could play a                  role in establishing the anterior-posterior axis of the                         developing embryo. They will determine where and why these                      channels appear by using image intensification and image                        enhancement techniques in conjunction with microinjection of                    heterochronic cytoplasm. They have discovered that potassium                    depolarization of cleavage stage embryos leads to a bright flash                which is due in part to calcium release from an internal store.                 They will investigate the mechanism that couples the calcium                    entry through the calcium channels to the calcium release                       internally. They will study the propagation of four sorts of                    calcium waves: 1. those due to IP3 diffusion in unfertilized                    eggs, 2. those that may occur at fertilization, 3. those due to                 depolarization of cleavage stage embryos, and 4. those                          accompanying metamorphosis.                                                     %%%                                                                             The importance of calcium as a regulator of a number of cellular                processes has been established. The question remains as to how is               the level of calcium itself controlled. Drs. Ridgway and Freeman                have developed a powerful model system in which to address this                 question. It exploits a naturally occurring luminescent protein                 found in hydrozoan embryos which emits light in the presence of                 calcium.",
