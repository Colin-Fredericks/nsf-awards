The Principal Investigator is investigating                  and documenting the Creole language of St. Barthelemy Island in                 the French West Indies.  Her previous fieldwork was in the Au                   Vent (\"Windward\", or eastern) side of the island.  That work,                   combined with existing knowledge about St. Barthelemy Creole                    (SBC), made it clear that there are two quite distinct varieties                of SBC.  The new research will take place in the Sous Le Vent                   (\"Leeward\", or western) side of the island, where the second                    variety is spoken.                                                                                                                                                   The existence of two distinct dialects on such a small                     island (25 sq. km.) is really quite remarkable, and poses a                     significant challenge to theories of language contact and                       creolization.  Some explanations which have been proffered relate               to the history of the island's settlement; these theories imply                 the existence of a dialect continuum connecting the two major                   varieties.  Whether such a continuum actually exists is an open                 question, however, which will be one focal point of the research                project.  If investigation discloses a sharp boundary between the               dialect areas, other explanations will need to be sought.  The                  Principal Investigator will be attempting to gather relevant                    social and historical data, as well as linguistic data, to                      develop such an explanation.",
