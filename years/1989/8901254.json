 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Old World blow fly, Chrysomya rufifacies, is one of four               Chrysomya spp. that have recently invaded the New World, and the                first to enter the United States.  These flies are pests in their               home range and pose a threat to U.S. agriculture and human                      health.  Displacement of native blow flies by these introduced                  species has been reported, but no mechanism of displacement has                 been demonstrated.  The biology of blow flies suggests that                     important population interactions occur during the larval stage.                These experiments will measure the impact of C. rufifacies on                   Cochliomyia macellaria, an native fly whose ecological habits                   most resemble those of C. rufifacies.  The time at which females                arrive at carrion and oviposit, along with the time larvae leave                carrion, will be used to determine the temporal overlap of fly                  species in carrion of 3 sizes and in 3 types of habitat.                        Densities of these two species in carrion will be manipulated to                determine the interaction between larvae of C. rufifacies and                   larvae of C. macellaria.  Preliminary observations indicate that                the red imported fire ant, an exotic insect that has recently                   invaded the study area may have become the dominant predator in                 the carrion community.  Exclusion experiments will define the                   role of this ant in carrion, and in particular, its effect on the               interaction of the two fly species.",
