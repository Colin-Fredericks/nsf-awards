 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is directed towards developing a methodology that         will ease the modelling and the implementation of multi-channel signal          interpretation problems.  An object-oriented approach is followed and           the system is organized around two separate but collaborating knowledge         bases.  The first involves the heuristics and the subjective knowledge          commonly utilized by expert interpreters, the second uses the more              qualitative knowledge utilized by a signal processing specialist.  The          collaboration between the two knowledge bases are handled by a coupling         mechanism.  The proposed system permits the modelling of interpretation         problems in terms of events and relations between events, and provides          a series of operators to express and represent spatio-temporal and              contextual information.                                                                                                                                                          This research is a first attempt at separating domain-         dependent and domain-independent (signal processing) knowledge, thus            improving generality, reusability, and facilitating the collaboration           of the two types of expertise typically required for the development of         automatic signal interpretation systems.  Specifically, it advances the         understanding of the theory of deep coupled systems where numerical and         symbolic methods are combined to improve overall system performance,            and addresses the problem of control flow and accumulation of evidence          for spatio-temporal reasoning.  To demonstrate the generality of the            approach, the system is tested on two different applications taken from         the medical domain: the interpretation of recordings of the cerebral            activity (EEG) and of muscular activity (EMG).",
