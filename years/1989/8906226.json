 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns several problems involving viscosity                      solutions and optimal control problems.  The first problem                      involves the extension of viscosity solution results to systems                 with quadratic and non-local coupling terms.  These coupling                    terms can represent interaction terms in competition and                        cooperative systems.  Monotone iteration schemes will be                        developed to solve such systems.                                                The second problem involves viscosity solutions for second                      order elliptic systems associated with two player games.  In an                 illustrative example, one player controls the switching of a                    diffusion process and the other player controls the stopping of                 the process.  One wants to show existence results for the                       system and prove that the viscosity solution gives the value of                 the saddle point of the game.                                                   The third problem is a direct study of optimality systems in                    which the state is governed by first order PDEs.  In minimizing                 a cost functional involving a target function, the goal is to                   characterize the optimal control and solve the optimality                       system (state equation with optimal control and the adjoint                     equation).",
