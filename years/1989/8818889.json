 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulation of the P element transposon in Drosophila                            melanogaster involves a cellular, maternally-transmitted,                       repressive condition known as P cytotype.  The major focus of                   this project will be a transinteraction where the repressor                     that constitutes P cytoype affects the expression of certain                    genes with P elements inserts.  This unusual interaction                        provides a model for the action of the P element repressor,                     and is a sensitive assay for the presence of repressor.  A                      large sample of affected alleles will be gathered, primarily                    at the singed locus.  These alleles will be characterized                       molecularly, and Northern analysis of singed transcripts will                   illuminate the mechanisms involved.  The cis requirements of                    the P inserts will be examined using deletions induced by P                     transposase.  An additional sensitive assay for the repressor                   is the ability to suppress in trans a special, stable,                          transposase-producing element called  2-3(99B).  This element                   will be characterized genetically and molecularly to                            determine the basis for its unusual properties of stability                     despite extraordinary, and apparently unregulated,                              transposase activity.  Together these assays provide the                        means to continue an examination of the nature of the P                         element repressor.                                                                                                                                              This work will improve our understanding of a major                             transposon in Drosophila, which will facilitate the                             understanding of comparable DNA parasites in other organisms.",
