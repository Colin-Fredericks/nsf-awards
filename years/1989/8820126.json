 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nickel sulfide deposits at Kambalda, Western Australia                 are the type-examples of Archean komatiite-associated nickel sul-               fide ores.  Stratigraphic and volcanological relationships at                   Kambalda suggest that the lowermost flows were channelized, that                they may have assimilated underlying sediments and basalts, and                 that this may have induced sulfide separation, modified magma:                  sulfide ratios, and influenced the composition of the sulfide                   ores.  An essential element in the evaluation of this process is                a determination of the degree of hybridization experienced by the               host units.  Although there is abundant geochemical and isotopic                evidence that associated komatiitic basalts have been                           contaminated by granitic crust during ascent, geochemical                       recognition of hybridization in the komatiites is hampered by the               dynamic nature of the lava flows and a paucity of detailed geo-                 chemical data in critical areas.                                                     The purpose of this project is to evaluate the degree of                   hybridization within the basal host units and across the                        komatiite sequence, using the trace element geochemistry of                     specially selected samples taken from diamond drill core and                    underground miner openings.  Geochemical analyses will be                       performed by wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence                           spectrometry and isotope dilution mass spectrometry.  Metasomatic               alteration during low grade regional metamorphism will be                       evaluated using mass balance calculations and emphasis will be                  placed on least-mobile trace elements.  The degree of hybridi-                  zation will be established by linear least-squares mixing calcu-                lations and  the combined effects of fractional crystallization                 and assimilation will be modeled thermodynamically.  The results                of this study will have wide applications in the fields of                      Archean geology, volcanology, and economic geology.",
