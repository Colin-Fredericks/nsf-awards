 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of related problems arising in the mathematical                   theory of several complex variables will be addressed in this                   project.  They are concerned primarily with the theory of                       analytic functions of several variables and the domains on which                the functions are defined.                                                           The first question concerns curves in two complex dimensions               on which restrictions of holomorphic functions can be expressed                 as a sum of two functions of a single variable.  The requirement                for this is that the two coordinates projections of the curve                   have multiplicity equal to one.  Work will be done in determining               what the form of the function can be if the multiplicities are                  known but are not equal.                                                             A second line of investigation will consider the higher                    dimensional form of a famous theorem of Carleman which relates                  the quadratic norm of the derivative of a holomorphic function                  with the integral of (the modulus of) the derivative along the                  boundary of a domain.  This result is the general isoperimetric                 inequality which allows for multiple coverings of the domain.  A                first step in this direction will be to consider n-sheeted covers               of a disk with boundary which has finite linear measure.  An                    interesting by-product of such a result would be to prove that                  such covers have finite measure, a fact which is not yet                        established.                                                                         A continuing investigation will also be carried out on the                 structure of polynomial hulls in two complex variables.  The                    polynomial hull of any compact set is the largest set to which                  all polynomials can be extended without increase in uniform norm.               Hulls are easy to describe in one complex dimension and almost                  impossible to visualize in several.  If the compact set lies over               a disk in the first variable, and the fibers are convex, then the               hull can be described precisely.  The current work will seek to                 analyze the hulls when the fibers are no longer connected, for                  example when then are the join of two disjoint Jordan curves.                   Some form of two-sheeted cover of the disk is the anticipated                   result.",
