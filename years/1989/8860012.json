 "awd_abstract_narration": "To support large currents in multifilamentary superconductors               based on niobium-titanium alloys, a fine scale substructure is                  required within the superconductor wire.  To produce substructure of            the order of 100A, the conventional multifilamentary superconductor             fabrication technology requires a rather large number of tedious                processing steps.  Typically a 5 inch diameter niobium-titanium alloy           ingot is mechanically worked through extrusion and wire drawing,                until 5 micrometers diameter filaments are obtained.  The chemical              inhomogeneity in the starting ingots that arises due to segregation             of alloying elements during solidification is often deleterious to              the superconductor properties.  An altogether new manufacturing route           for the preparation of multifilamentary superconductors is proposed,            which has the potential of producing superconductors with improved              characteristics, and significantly lower cost.  The approach involves           preparing continuous superconductor filaments, typically 40                     micrometers thick, directly from the melt.  Such thin filaments, when           extracted from the melt experience high solidification rates.  The              high solidification rates lead to a chemically homogeneous                      microstructure with extremely fine grain sizes and sub-structures of            the order of 100A.                                                                  This project will address the feasibility of obtaining desirable            microstructures for flux pinning and high critical current density.             This development will obviate all the                                           processing steps requiring extensive mechanical deformation.                    Approaches to incorporate the superconductor filaments prepared                 directly from the melt, into composite wires will also be                       explored.  The work will result in significant property                         improvements in fine multifilamentary composite niobium-titanium                superconductors, and considerable cost reduction in the                         production of such wires.  The material will be suitable for a                  wide range of applications including dipoles and quadrapoles for                future high energy accelerator magnets.",
