 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to develop a small, easy-to-use                      instrument to perform cell cycle studies, and related work on                   cellular proliferation, aging, partitioning and development, on                 both eukaryotes and prokaryotes in steady-state growth.  This new               technology will apply a concept currently used for cell cycle                   studies on bacteria.  In the procedure, cells are grown on a                    surface such that each time a cell divides, one new daughter cell               remains attached to the surface and the other is released form                  the surface.  As a result, newborn cells are shed continuously                  form the surface for use in any cell cycle/cell age                             investigation.  The unique aspect of the technique is that the                  investigation can be performed on large quantities of cells in                  long-term, undisturbed, balanced growth.  In the instruments to                 be developed in this project, the surfaces will  be covered with                a pattern of small spots to which cells will adhere, with a                     matrix between the spots to which the cell will not adhere or                   will adhere less firmly.  The project entails:  the production of               appropriate cell adherent surfaces the testing of the surfaces in               an experimental flow cell system, the design and construction of                the culture apparatus for large-scale production of cells of                    uniform age, and the evaluation of the instruments for cell cycle               studies on cells in steady-state growth.",
