 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Missouri at Columbia curates a large                          archeological collection which resulted from over 50 years of                   intensive fieldwork throughout Missouri.  It constitutes the                    largest and best documented holding of prehistoric materials in                 the state.  Particularly noteworthy within this are specimens                   from a seven-county area in southeastern Missouri.  Recently, the               university acquired the Naylor collection, curated by Southwest                 Missouri State University, which also consists of materials from                this part of the state.  Because of the poor storage conditions,                the University of Missouri at Columbia has agreed to move the                   Naylor materials to Columbia and incorporate them within the                    larger collection.  Both sets of material, especially the Naylor                part of the collection, are in need of extensive curation.                                                                                                      With National Science Foundation support the currently held and                 newly acquired materials will be consolidated into a single                     integrated collection ordered by site.  Materials will be sorted,               inventoried, stabilized, and treated as necessary.  They will be                restored and all organized together with their accompanying                     documentation.  A computerized data management system designed                  for rapid and efficient retrieval of information will be                        developed, and, in sum, these actions will serve both to conserve               the collection and make it maximally useful for scientific                      research.                                                                                                                                                       This project is important for several reasons.  The materials in                the collection document an important aspect of American                         prehistory.  Perhaps the most complex native American societies                 developed along the Mississippi river and the Missouri materials                shed light on this process.  Therefore, they are of great                       scientific importance.  If they are allowed to deteriorate                      further and become separated from their documentation,                          irreplaceable specimens will lose their scientific value.                       Through this project they will be saved for generations of                      scientific research.",
