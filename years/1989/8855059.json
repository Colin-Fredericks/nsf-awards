The college proposes to accomplish these goals through                     activities planned for a six-week summer program for students                   followed by a series of after-school sessions one day a week                    during the academic year.  Interaction with local industries                    relevant to individual projects is also planned in the form                     of plant visits and a day in industry one-on-one as                             understudies to practicing engineering or scientists.  The                      program will be an expansion of two different pilot programs                    that have been conducted successfully during the past few                       months with groups of underachiever junior high students.",
