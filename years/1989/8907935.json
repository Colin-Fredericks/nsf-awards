WFEO, currently                     headquartered in London, comprises 85 national members and several              regional associations of engineering societies.  UPADI,                         headquartered in Venezuela, has national members from 27 Western                Hemisphere countries and is an international member of WFEO. UITA               is headquartered in Paris and is a federation of thirty technical               organizations, without national members.                                        The U.S. engineering community has made great strides toward the                creation of more effective, more unified international engineering              organizations.  New U.S. appointments have been made to major WFEO              Technical Committees, the management of WFEO has been strengthened              under new leadership, WFEO and UITA have agreed to cooperate on                 joint projects of mutual interest, and links with major                         international programs are being developed.  The U.S. is also                   playing an enlarged role in UPADI.  Enhancement of these efforts,               will strengthen the voice and influence of U.S. engineering                     internationally, help to encourage the further development of                   joint activities between international engineering organizations,               and provide other important benefits.",
