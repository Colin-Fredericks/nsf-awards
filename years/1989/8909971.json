 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum interference effects have been experimentally observed in               semiconductors.  Electron waves in semiconductors possess many common           characteristics with the electromagnetic waves in dielectrics.  Two             separate analogies are necessary for amplitude and phase effects in             relating electron to electromagnetic waves.  These analogies can be             exploited for designing electron-wave devices that are analogous to             optical wave devices.  For these devices to work, their dimensions              should be smaller than the electron coherence length.  Quantum                  interference bandpass electron filters, emitter/filters and, electron-          wave slab waveguides have recently been proposed.  The objective of             the research in this Research Initiation Award is to analyze                    theoretically the potential performance of these structures.  Included          in this research would be: (a) Modeling of the quantum-mechanical               electron waves and electron-wave semiconductor waveguides including             the: analysis of the effective mass anisotropy calculation of the               waveguide density of energy states, and current flow distributions in           the substrate, film, and cove regions.  (b) Design of lowpass,                  highpass, and bandpass electron filters, emitter/filters, and                   waveguides.  (c) Analysis of electron diffraction gratings, electron            beamsplitters, electron modulators, switches, and deflectors.  (d) The          possibility of designing integrated guided-electron wave devices that           are analogous to integrated optics devices.  Applications of the                proposed research include the areas of supercomputers, high speed               communications, electron spectroscopy, and other.",
