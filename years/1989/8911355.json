The instrument                   will make in-situ measurements of chlorophyll absorption at                     675 and 750 nm.  The key to this instrument is the applica-                     tion of newly developed LED technology.  A new dual wave-                       length light source at 675nm and 750nm will be designed and                     fabricated.  They will then be placed in a prototype instru-                    ment and validated.  The absorption meter will measure the                      ratio of light source output to received signal at a fixed                      distance within the submerged tube.  The ratio of light                         emitted to that received at the wavelengths of maximum                          chlorophyll absorption will then indicate the abundance of                      chlorophyll and phaeophytin pigments in the water.  Such                        information is important in a variety of ecological, environ-                   mental, and remote sensing studies.  The absorption meter                       will provide an unobtrusive measure of chlorophyll abundance                    and represents a major improvement over present methods of                      making these measurements using fluorometers.  Furthermore,                     the LEDs require very little power so profiling and long-term                   mooring applications are more feasible.",
