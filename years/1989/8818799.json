 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the seminar is to investigate the apparent                           discrepancy between recent rapid and pervasive technological                    change and the long-term fall in the rate of growth of total                    factor productivity and of gross national product.  The                         seminar will permit the findings of recent and ongoing                          U.S.studies to be integrated into an international empirical                    and analytical framework allowing for a comparison of results,                  an analytical confrontation with European and Japanese                          approaches.  The above issue will be examined from four main                    angles:  the measurement of technical change and the                            calculation of factor produtivity;  the management of the                       productive resources, the organization of firms in the face                     of current change and obstacles to the diffusion of new                         technologies; the relationships, interface and interactions                     between current major technological development and its                         structural impact on the orgnization of the manufacturing                       service sectors; economic growth modelling, macro/micro                         relationships and macro-economic policy for technical change                    and growth.                                                                     The seminar will map out areas of economic and social                           research that is required for improved policy making to                         facilitate the diffusion and adoption of new technologies and                   their subsequent development. It is also anticipated to                         provide the U.S. with new information on measuring economic                     returns to R&D.",
