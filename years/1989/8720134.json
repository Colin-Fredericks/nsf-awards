 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the purchase of a high-field NMR             spectrometer and computer equipment, and of an X-ray generator, area            detector and associated smaller items.  The equipment will be shared by         an group of outstanding structural biologists at the University of              California at Berkeley.  Studies to be performed by the group include           experimental studies of the structure and function of enzymes, of other         proteins and of self-splicing and other RNAs.  More theoretical work            aimed at prediction of protein structure will also be undertaken.                   The development and application of 2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy           and X-ray crystallography to the study of the structure and function of         biological macromolecules like RNA and protein is currently one of the          most exiting areas of biological research.  Although NMR instruments            have been available for many years, it is only within the last few              years that high field instruments with the requisite resolution and             sensitivity for such studies have been developed.  Similarly, the               development of X-ray area detectors and of high speed computers has             made the acquisition and interpretation of X-ray crystallographic data          a relatively routine procedure.  Thus, equipment of the type to be              purchased with these funds now plays a vital role in the progress of            our understanding of macromolecular structure.",
