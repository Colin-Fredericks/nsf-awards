 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)                             spectroscopy offers the chemist one of the most powerful tools                  available for the study of the physical and chemical properties                 of materials.  Fundamental knowledge of structure and dynamics                  of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals, and                      liquid crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques.                    Solid-state NMR studies often complement those carried out                      using solution NMR and X-ray analysis.  Access to solid-state                   NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    and the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program will                     help the Department of Chemistry at the University of North                     Carolina, Chapel Hill, to acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer                 suitable for carrying out solid-state NMR studies.  The areas                   of chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition                   include the following:                                                                                                                                          1) Solid-state NMR of chemically modified surfaces                              2) NMR of polymer melts, liquid crystals, solids and gels                       3) Solid-state NMR spectral studies of polymer-bound transition                    metal electrocatalysts                                                       4) Carbon-13 and phosphorous-31 CP-MAS NMR studies of                              dioxyphosphoranes                                                            5) Electroactive polymers and films                                             6) High-resolution electrophoretic NMR and MRI for the                             characterization of microemulsions.",
