 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the petals of carnation flowers, the phytohormone ethylene is                involved in the initiation and regulation of petal senescence.                  Here Dr. Woodson aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms                   involved in petal senescence, and determine how ethylene acts to                initiate this developmental program. His approach to the problem                is to clone genes that are expressed during carnation petal                     senescence and study how the expression of these genes is                       regulated both during the temporal development of senescence and                by ethylene. He will use these cloned cDNAs as hybridization                    probes to determine the relative abundance of the mRNAs they                    represent during the senescence of petals and in response to                    ethylene treatment. He will determine the spatial distribution of               these senescence specific mRNAs by in situ hybridization.                       Transcriptional regulation of senescence specific genes will be                 assessed by nuclear run off experiments. He will correlate                      senescence specific genes to gene products by in vitro                          translation of hybrid selected mRNAs. Expression of antisense RNA               will be used to determine if these genes are essential for                      senescence. Selected cDNAs will be used to isolate genomic cones                for analysis of the cis elements which determine the expression                 of these genes. Gene chimeras will be constructed that contain                  the 5' flanking sequences of these genes and the coding sequence                for the reporter gene beta-glucuronidase (GUS). Following                       transformation of carnations and petunias, the capacity for the                 promoters from senescence specific genes to direct the                          developmental and/or hormonal regulation of gene expression will                be assessed by assaying for GUS activity.                                       %%%                                                                             Senescence represents the final stage in the development of a                   whole plant, organ tissue or cell. The flower is often the organ                with the shortest life span, and as such provides a useful tissue               for studying the mechanisms underlying control of senescence.",
