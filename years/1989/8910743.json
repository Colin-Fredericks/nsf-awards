 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal develops and empirically tests a theoretical                      model of self-regulatory processes as they affect the                           acquisition of skills needed for performance of complex,                        high-consequence decision making.  Self-monitoring of                           learning affects both job performance and job training, and                     this project has general implications for the study of                          decision making and specific implications for the training                      and performance of the selected target population of Air                        Traffic Controllers (ATC).  The behavior in question includes                   establishing realistic performance goals, anticipating the                      consequences of activities, and monitoring the effects of                       one's own actions.  The proposed study involves three parts:                    a first phase in which a theoretical model is refined and                       initial hypotheses tested on ATC trainees, a second phase in                    which experiments are conducted using a computerized,                           real-time simulation of an ATC task, and a third phase in                       which self-regulatory determinants of behavior are tested                       using advanced ATC trainees.  The proposed hypotheses are                       interesting and complex, including questions about when                         task-related demands are sufficiently high that                                 self-monitoring may become counter-productive.  The                             empirically-verified research results could have direct                         implications for the design of job-training programs and                        for increasing the effectiveness of complex decision making                     in stressful job situations.",
