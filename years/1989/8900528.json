 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symbiotic dinoflagellates are single-celled organisms that                 inhabit a variety of invertebratre hosts (e.g., coelenterates).                 Dinoflagellates belong to a diverse and poorly understood                       assemblage of unicellular organisms known as protists.  They are                also important indicators of water quality, which makes them                    important to ecologists and physiologists.  Dr. Robert Trench is                a leading researcher on the life cycles and ecology of                          dinoflagellates, and he proposes to widen his research by                       learning to analyze the RNA sequences of symbiotic                              dinoflagellates in order to reconstruct their evolutionary                      relationships.  Dr. Trench will learn these techniques in the lab               of Dr. Clifford Brunk of the University of California, Los                      Angeles, who uses molecular techniques to study other protists.                      The proposed research will equip Dr. Trench to pursue an                   unexplored aspect of dinoflagellate evolution.  The results of                  his studies will address the ways in which symbiotic organisms                  come to inhabit their hosts, a question of wide interest to                     biologists.  The collaboration between Drs. Trench and Brunk will               energize the current efforts to understand the evolution of                     protists, among which the ancestors to multicellular life will be               found.",
