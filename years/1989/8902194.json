 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is much current interest in isolating nuclear proteins that               bind to specific DNA sequences in and around eukaryotic genes.                  The rationale behind this often derives from data that show the                 sequence elements bound are important in mediating expression or                regulation of the gene in question.  However, it is increasingly                clear that the question of whether the particular DNA-protein                   interaction under investigation actually occurs in vivo in a                    given tissue should be addressed.  Often specific factors are                   unable to bind to their recognition sequences because a precise                 pathway of chromatin assembly has excluded them from the                        nucleoprotein complex.  Moreover, distinct protein species may                  recognize identical sequence elements, but in a given cell type                 only one of them may be utilized for gene regulation.  In this                  light we plan to use rapid and sensitive genomic footprinting                   techniques recently developed in this laboratory to study, at                   single base resolution, the in vivo nucleoprotein organization                  and specific binding patterns characteristic of Drosophila locus                67B1.  In this manner it is expected that important regulatory                  sequences and details of their binding interaction will                         uncovered.  Consisting of at least seven closely-linked genes                   that are hormonally regulated in differing tissue-and                           developmental-specific patterns (in addition to thermal                         induciblity in virtually all tissues) locus 67B1 is obviously                   highly complex in regulatory terms.  Organization at hsp22 and                  hsp27 is of particular interest since their expression patterns                 show elements of both coordinate and independent modes of                       developmental regulation.  With a precise developmental and                     tissue-specific description of the effects of hormone on the in                 vivo nucleoprotein organization, together with the results of DNA               sequence-related effects obtained via P-element mediated                        transformation, it is expected that this project will provide the               detailed baseline to which in vitro binding and transcription                   assays must be referred for relevance.  We plan to initiate such                in vitro work with extracts  prepared from both hormonally naive                and exposed cells and tissues, with a long term goal of                         recapitulating aspects of the hormonal regulation imposed upon                  these genes.                                                                                                                                                    Understanding what actually happens in the cell as contrasted to                what can happen in a test tube is often difficult.  The results                 of this in vivo study of a gene family with a complex regulatory                pattern should give insight into some of the those potential                    differences and, with luck, the reasons for those differences.",
