 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                         research of Dr.Robert S. Sheridan dealing with the independent                  generation, isolation, characterization and reactivity of                       energetic intermediates which have been proposed in aromatic                    photochemistry.                                                                                                                                                 The general approach centers on the synthesis and study of                      precursors to these reactive intermediates.  Major goals are:                   (1) Elucidation of the factors distinguishing stepwise from                     concerted thermal and photochemical reactions; (2) Mechanistic                  elucidation of aromatic photoadditions; (3) Synthesis of novel,                 high-energy precursors to aromatic compounds; (4) Examination                   of \"hot-molecule\" effects in condensed phases; (5) Definition                   of the limits to the observation of highly unstable molecules.                  Highly exothermic precursor molecules will be synthesized where                 aromatic moieties are formally bound to small, stable fragments                 such as CO, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The chemiluminescence                  and adiabatic photoluminescence of these molecules will be                      observed as these molecules react to form benzenoid structures.                 Spectroscopic studies of the photoreactions of the molecules of                 interest will be investigated using low temperature matrix                      isolation techniques.",
