 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the dynamic control of the welding                 process.  The objective of the research is to investigate                       simultaneous adaptive control over two variables of the welding                 process.  This will be accomplished by using advanced infrared                  sensing techniques to monitor the thermal field in the vicinity                 of the weld pool.  While both theoretical solutions and                         experiment agree sufficiently to enable dynamic control of one                  weld variable such as seam tracking, the simultaneous                           identification, sorting and correction of two or more                           perturbations presents an immense problem in theoretical and                    practical analysis.                                                                  This research will develop theoretical and experimental                    tools to identify, sort and understand changes in surface                       temperature distributions resulting from the simultaneous                       encountering of two or more defects.  Theoretical models of                     heat transfer will be advanced to describe the surface                          temperature distribution for simultaneous perturbations in the                  process.  Computer hierarchial methods of analyzing the thermal                 fields and the implementation of the control responses will be                  developed.  The ultimate result of this research will be the                    advancement of the scientific basis upon which future machines                  may be produced that are capable of eliminating defective                       welds and increasing the productivity of the welding process.",
