 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support cooperative research between Professor C.W.             Berisford of the University of Georgia, Dr. D.L. Dahlsten of the                University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. F.D.Morgan of the                   University of Adelaide, Australia.  The investigators will study the            effects of insect parasites and predators on the pine bark beetle in            Australia and, in so doing, will also develop a reliable sampling               technique for future evaluations of this type.                                                                                                                  The Australian environment is a uniquely suitable one for this study,           since the pine bark beetle is the only species of bark beetle there,            and its interaction with parasites and predators can therefore be               studied without the confounding effects of competitor species.  The             project combines the experience and expertise of the three inves-               tigators; those from the U.S. are experts on the parasites and                  predators of the pine bark beetle, and their Australian  collaborator           has been directing a biological control program for these insects.              The work has the potential to increase our understanding of the                 biological control process for agricultural pests, as well as of some           basic aspects of classical biological control, such as single vs.               multiple introductions of biological enemies.",
