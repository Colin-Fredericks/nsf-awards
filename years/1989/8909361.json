 "awd_abstract_narration": "A promising development in economics is the development and use                 of computational experiments.  This entails computing the                       equilibrium process for a well specified model economy.  These                  methods have been used to address various economic questions such               as the dead weight loss associated with various tax schemes or                  the quantitative contributions of various stochastic disturbances               to the business cycle.  But previously, the application of these                methods has typically used a representative agent or                            deterministic economy.                                                                                                                                          Some heterogeneous agent economies are known to behave as if                    there were a single standing household. For addressing some                     questions, however, the justification for the use of a standing                 agent abstract is dictated purely by computational                              considerations.  Recent findings that show that standing agent                  economies underestimate the cost of inflation by a factor of                    three, and this suggests that for most issues in monetary                       economics, heterogeneous agent economies are needed. The                        investigator has developed practical computational methods for                  analyzing multi-agent economies, and one part of this project                   will apply these methods to study such economies with explicit                  stochastic monetary policy rules.  This analysis will provide a                 better understanding of the relationship between the monetary and               real sectors.                                                                                                                                                   The second part of the project will exploit recent developments                 in general equilibrium theory to develop a way to measure the                   output of the financial intermediation sector.  These methods                   entail the hedonic pricing of complex contracts.  Using these                   same theoretical advances, an analysis of economies, in which                   both the number of workers operating each plant and the number of               hours each plant is operated can be varied, will be conducted.                  Preliminary results indicate this is an important consideration                 for business cycle accounting.  Finally, an empirical study to                  determine the nature of productivity and output movements at the                industry level will be undertaken.  The key feature of this                     analysis is that human capital is in part firm specific.  The                   question being addressed is whether procyclical productivity                    movements are an artifact of abstracting from this feature and                  not the result of exogenous technological change. This question                 is another important issue in business cycle accounting.",
