 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports collaborative research by                   Dr. J.N. Reddy, Department of Engineering Science and                           Mechanics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State                             University, Blacksburg and Dr. K.N. Seetharamu, Department of                   Mechnaical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology,                         Madras, India.  These two scientists plan to develop a finite                   element computer program for the analysis of complex fluid                      flows with heat transfer in three-dimensional domains.  The                     solution of the Navier-Stokes equations with the energy                         equation in three dimensions will use the finite element                        method based on the penalty-function approach.  Account will                    be taken of variation of material properties, such as                           viscosity, coefficient of thermal expansion, thermal                            conductivity, with temperature and/or strain rates.  The                        result could be the development of a powerful tool for solving                  complex problems in engineering applications such as in heat                    exchangers.  The development of such a tool is possible at                      this time with the availability of extremely powerful                           computers in many laboratories thus making it possible to                       apply the finite element methods to geometries of material and                  flows that are unwieldly by analytical methods.                                                                                                                 Scope:  The topic of this research project was developed                        following an Indo-U.S. workshop on research needs in heat                       transfer, held in Madras, India in December, 1981.  The                         development of the proposal was completed in 1986 with                          contributions by Drs. Reddy and Seetharamu who are leaders in                   the field of numerical and finite element analysis.  The                        cooperative research is of direct importance to the                             development of these tools of solving engineering problems,                     and should benefit engineers and scientists in both countries.",
