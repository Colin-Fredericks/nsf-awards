 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project seeks to improve the teaching of geometry in            kindergarten through grade 8 by increasing the quantity and quality of          the geometry that is taught.  Each summer, forty teachers from the              Baltimore area will participate in a four-week workshop that integrates         instruction in mathematical content and methodology, especially the use         of manipulatives and educational software.  Follow-up activities include        four meetings during the academic year and visits by the project staff          to the participants' classrooms.  The evaluation will assess the                project's effect on the participants' knowledge of and attitudes towards        geometry and on their teaching practices.                                                                                                                       The emphasis on manipulative activities and concrete applications, as           well as the focus on lower grade levels, makes this project especially          beneficial for teachers of minority students.  The project represents a         collaborative effort by a university research mathematician, an                 independent school, and the Baltimore Public Schools.  A majority of the        participants will be teachers from schools with large minority                  enrollments.                                                                                                                                                    The Abell Foundation and the Baltimore Public Schools are contributing          in cost-sharing an amount equal to 19% of the NSF award.",
