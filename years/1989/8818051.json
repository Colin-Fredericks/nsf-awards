 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mosses form a conspicuous element in many tropical                         ecosystems, yet they remain little known to those residing in                   tropical countries and little known even to those conducting                    research on mosses.  Dr. Steven Churchill of the New York                       Botanical Garden has embarked on the first complete moss                        inventory of a South American country, Colombia, to produce an                  illustrated and descriptive account of the estimated 900 species                of mosses of this rich, mountainous country.  The project                       involves cooperative activities with Colombian institutions; Dr.                Churchill will lecture on his moss researches, will help build                  reference collections for museums, and will work with staff and                 students to promote better understanding and research                           possbilities for this group of plants.                                               The first phase will include intensive field collecting in                 half of the 32 departments of Colombia, to augment existing                     herbarium collections in the U.S., Colombia, and elsewhere.  The                area for collection will inlude the western half of Colombia from               the coastal Pacific and Atlantic departments which contain both                 wet and dry tropical vegetation, and extending to central montane               regions.  Concurrent with this phase will be the preparation of                 descriptions and illustrations for half of the expected species.                Also to be accomplished are preparation of a checklist of                       scientific names of Colombian mosses and a catalogue of herbarium               specimens of Colombian taxa, compiled in a computer database at                 the New York Botanical Garden.",
