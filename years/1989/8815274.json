 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in organic                       synthesis between Dr. James Hendrickson, Brandeis University and                Dr. Michel Chanon, Laboratory of Inorganic Molecular Chemistry,                 University of Aix-Marseille III.  The project has two interrelated              goals.  The first is to explore a number of quantitative measures               of the efficacy or \"optimality\" of any synthesis plan, with an                  ultimate view to developing a unitary optimality value to judge                 and compare synthesis plans.  Synthesis plans for this search will              be taken both from the literature and from computer generation and              will be incorporated into a computer database for automatic                     calculation of defined values.  The investigators will use                      multivariate analysis to classify and rank the plans for global                 comparison.  In the second area they will seek to use such                      measures to develop a clearer formalization of synthesis design                 and so more specific procedures for synthesis plan generation.                  Among their research groups they have already explored several                  such design procedures (SYNGEN, FORWARD, REKEST); the optimality                measures will help to judge the efficacy of different design                    models.                                                                                                                                                         Both the US and French investigators have significant expertise in              this area of research.  Dr. Hendrickson has been one of the                     pioneers in the adaptation of computers for the design of organic               synthesis.  The results of this project should lead to improved                 computer programs for this important area of chemistry.",
