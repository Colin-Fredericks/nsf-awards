 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will collect,  store and catalog a wide range of                   materials pertaining to the announcement of \"cold fusion\" at the                University of Utah on March 23, 1989.  These documents --                       collected in the midst of on-going and heated debates among                     chemists and physicists -- will enable scholars to better                       understand science \"as it happens\".  Whether or not recent                      experimental claims are defined as valid,  the episode is a                     strategic research site for historians,  sociologists,  policy                  analysts,  communication scholars and others interested in how                  science works.                                                                                                                                                  Several features of the cold fusion case make it of special                     interest.  Communication patterns among scientists have been                    altered dramatically by recent electronic and computer                          innovations (FAX machines,  computer mail networks,  electronic                 bulletin boards),  which have allowed virtually instantaneous                   communication of both fact and rumor,  raising troubling                        questions about the viability of \"peer review\" systems associated               with traditional forms of print communication in scientific                     journals.  The simultaneous promise of an enlarged understanding                of nature and a lucrative technology based on cold fusion have                  blurred the boundary between \"pure\" and \"applied\" science.  At                  the same time, the mass media have played a fundamental role in                 bringing the cold fusion controversy to national attention and                  scientists themselves have used the mass media for communicating                among their professional peers.                                                                                                                                 In order for scholars to be able to investigate these and other                 topics,  primary source materials must be collected today.  With                so much communication moving by electronic means  -- relatively                 ephemeral compared to print --  it is imperative to act quickly                 before valuable materials are \"purged\",  and thus irretrievably                 lost.  It is especially important to collect these data before                  consensus has formed and the facts have been settled.  Later                    accounts,  experience tells us, will \"reconstruct\" the events in                often creative ways.",
