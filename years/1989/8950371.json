 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to develop a laboratory course in fermentation                  processes, an area of biotechnology that has been neglected, and one in         which trained Bachelor's level people are in great demand.  The                 laboratory involves exercises in: 1. fermentation processes from shake-         flask stage to scale up in minifermentors; 2. culture selection,                maintenance and management; 3. product analysis and recovery. The               fermentation equipment request is for a series of 1 to 2-liter                  fermentors ranging from basic to computer-interfaced, as well as for            auxiliary equipment (waterbaths, lyophilizer, freezer) to be used for           inoculum preparation, culture, and product management. It will add to           the students' ability to gather and analyze fermentation process data           as well as to understand the physiological processes involved. This             course could serve as a model for biotechnology training at the                 undergraduate level.                                                            The university will provide 50% matching funds.",
