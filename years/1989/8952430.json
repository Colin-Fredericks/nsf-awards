 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Psychology Department emphasizes research and has a required three          course research sequence.  The ten PC-AT computers currently on hand do         not have the software or hardware to update this research sequence.             Therefore, the students do not have an adequate exposure to the                 development and completion of contemporary research.  With equipment in         this award, these PC computers are linked in a network which makes it           practical to use experimentally oriented software.  In addition to the          network, hardware and software is being purchased that a) simulates             theoretical models and typical research results, b) runs the students           in classic and contemporary experiments, and c) allows students to use          these computers for stimulus presentation, data collection and analysis         for their own independent research projects.  Additional course                 materials are being developed locally.  Results of this project will be         presented at professional meetings and published to encourage other             departments to extend their use of computers into undergraduate                 instruction.  The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal           amount of funds.",
