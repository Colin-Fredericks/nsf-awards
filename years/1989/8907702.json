 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal for a Research Planning Grant of the               ROW program is to determine the feasibility of a new theoretical                approach to study the elastic properties of disordered solids.                  In this project preliminary studies will be performed to                        determine whether it is feasible to apply a new analytic method                 based on Wilson`s renormalization-group theory of phase                         transitions \u0131Nobel Prize in Physics 1982! to some challenging                   unsolved problems of elasticity of disordered solids, which                     numerical analysis and computer simulations have been unable to                 solve.  In these preliminary studies, the focus of attention will               be on two microscopic models of elasticity which are currently                  studied by many researchers, the central-force model and the                    bond-bending model.  There are two fundamental unanswered                       questions concerning the behavior to disordered elastic solids                  which will be addressed in this preliminary study:  1) What are                 the elastic properties of the central-force model (1) and the                   bond-bending model (2) in the neighborhood of the elasticity                    threshold pc?  2) Are the critical elastic properties of the                    central-force model universal, i.e., independent of the nature of               the lattice?  It is proposed to examine whether it is feasible to               answer the above questions 1) and 2) by using a new analytic                    renormalization-group approach partly based on ideas and methods                they developed in their studies of the pure percolation model and               of the conductivity of disordered solids.",
