 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support for continuation of Brookhaven                 National Laboratory experiment 791, a search for very rare                      decays of the neutral K meson.  This experiment has had an                      engineering run and one physics run.  Another physics run is                    anticipated this winter.  Wojcicki was the spokesman for two                    years and remains in a leadership role.                                              The experiment searches for K zero-long decaying into muon                 and electron (forbidden by lepton number conservation) and into                 muon and muon (suppressed by the standard model).  The latter                   mode will be studied with good statistics; the former is a                      probe to mass scales much higher than can be achieved in direct                 reactions with current accelerators.                                                 An additional mode to be studied is into neutral pion,                     electron and positron.  This is a CP violating decay; it is                     possible that direct CP violation may dominate in this decay.",
