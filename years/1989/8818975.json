 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prospects for achieving ultrastrong magnetic fields is of                   fundamental significance to engineers and physicists who are concerned          with challenging current limits of physical understanding and                   innovative technological achievement.  An exploratory theoretical               study, based on previous NSF supported work (ECS-8614652), is proposed          on a new approach to ultrastrong magnetic field generation.  The new            approach includes induction of return-electron-currents driven by               laser beams and magnetic flux compression by laser implosion.  The              proposed concept may be capable of producing magnetic fields limited            in magnitude only by the brightness of available laser sources.                 Theoretically, there appears no limit on the magnetic field strength            that can be generated by the method of laser irradiation.  With the             proposed approach, magnetic fields of up to 100 MG at rising speeds             higher than 100 MG in 100 psec can be achieved essentially without              modification of existing laser facilities.  Potential applications              include microparticle acceleration, studies of geological and                   industrial material samples under extreme pressure conditions,                  simulation of an EMP and study of its effects on high-Tc materials and          semiconductors, solid state physics, high-energy-density physics and            developments of high energy radiation sources.  This work is intended           to provide a theoretical model for future experimental efforts to               bring the concept up to the level of practical applications.",
