 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed toward an improved, mechanistic                       understanding of the factors affecting drying rates, particle                   morphology, and other product-quality attributes in spray drying.               Hot-wire anemometry and tracer studies are used to define flow and              mixing patterns in the region outside the spray envelope in a                   laboratory dryer.  In a second experiment rates of loss of a trace              volatile component are monitored during drying of a suspended drop,             with simultaneous monitoring of morphological change by video                   techniques.                                                                                                                                                     This research should make it possible to obtain superior flavor and             aroma attributes and better bulk-density control of food products --            such as instant coffee, tea, and milk -- made by spray drying.  It              should, as well, enable more knowledgeable design and selection of              operating conditions in spray dryers, leading to more cost-efficient            operation, and more reliable product quality.",
