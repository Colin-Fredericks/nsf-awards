 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will employ a technique called total internal reflection          microscopy (TIRM) for the measurement of colloidal particle position            relative to a flat surface.  TIRM is based on measuring the intensity           of light scattered by a particle in the evanescent wave region of an            otherwise totally reflecting surface.  Due to the strong variation of           intensity with distance, nanometer resolution is possible.  By                  measuring the time variations of position for a system at equilibrium,          one is able to infer the potential energy of interaction or force               between the particle and surface as functions of the separation.  The           technique will be improved and used to deduce electrical double layer           forces.                                                                                                                                                         The research should provide a new and extremely useful tool for                 colloid science.  It will give a critical evaluation of the theories            for colloidal forces.  The results will be very important to                    understanding particle deposition rates and deposition patterns as              well as consolidation of green bodies dominated by colloidal forces.",
