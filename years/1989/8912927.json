 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental and theoretical work will be carried out on quantum                and charging energy effects in sub-micron sized tunnel junctions,               on high-temperature superconductivity, and on arrays of Josephson               junctions; ongoing work on quantum conductance fluctuations in                  amorphous microbridges will be completed this year.  The proposed               work will be carried out with the aid of our new clean room                     microfabrication facility and microwave facility, together with                 our dilution refrigerator facility, which allows us to reach the                low temperatures which are required for the work on quantum                     effects in small junctions.  The objective of the work on small                 tunnel junctions is to understand the interplay between forces                  dependent on the phase of the superconducting pair wavefunction                 and those dependent on deviations from electrical chage                         neutrality; devices sensitive to the charge of a single electron                may be possible.  Their work on high temperature superconductors                is focussed on the phenomena of flux creep and flow with                        associated energy dissipation; their emphasis is on ac                          measurements at frequencies from dc up to microwaves.  The                      potential practical significance of these materials is well-                    known.  Their work on fabricated Josephson junction arrays will                 emphasize their use as model systems serving as a controlled                    laboratory prototype for study of the behavior of granular high                 temperature superconductors.",
