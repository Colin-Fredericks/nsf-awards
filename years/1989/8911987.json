 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extensin mRNA and protein in plant cell walls have been shown                   to increase in response to wounding, ethylene, pathogen                         infection and exposure to fungal and plant cell wall                            elicitors, suggesting a protective function for this cell                       wall protein.  This project studies another cell wall protein                   in carrot storage roots and soybean, called p33, that also                      increases in wounded tissue and also plays a role in normal                     plant development.  The recent identification of a number of                    proline/hydroxyproline-rich protein genes which share                           sequence homology with the carrot p33 sequence suggests that                    p33 may represent a new class of structural cell wall                           proteins.  Promoter deletion analysis is used to identify DNA                   sequences which are responsible for the synthesis of p33 in                     wounded carrot roots.  These studies will allow                                 the cis-acting regions which modulate p33 expression in                         wounded tissue and allow determination of whether these same                    sequences are used to regulate the expression of p33 during                     normal plant development.  Deletion analysis of specific                        regions of the carrot p33 sequence will be used to identify                     possible \"domains\" within the p33 protein necessary for its                     function and interaction with other cell wall components.                       These domain deletion studies will represent a new approach                     to identifying sequences which may be necessary for the                         function of structural cell wall proteins in higher                             plants.%%%                                                                                                                                                      The cell walls of higher plants are dynamic structures which                    undergo changes in composition and structure in relation to                     cell age, tissue type and environmental stimuli.  Much of the                   analysis of the structural protein component of the cell wall                   has dealt with extensin, a hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein,                    and the genes which encode it.  This study centers on a newly                   discovered cell wall protein which plays a role in normal                       plant growth.***//",
