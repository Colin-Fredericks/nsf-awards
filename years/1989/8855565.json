 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Board of Regents University of Wisconsin System is                          expanding a comprehensive plan for the in-service education                     of teachers of elementary, middle and high schools through                      the establishment of Science Education Service Centers at                       seven campuses of the University of Wisconsin.  The Wisconsin                   Department of Public Instruction will cooperate to develop a                    network of these model science education service centers that                   will be designed to meet the diverse needs of elementary,                       middle/junior high and senior high school science teachers                      from all parts of the state.  The seven sites chosen for the                    continuation of the Centers represent different population                      profiles.                                                                                                                                                       Programs will be held at the following university campus for                    the following levels:                                                                                                                                                Green Bay - High School                                                         La Crosse - Elementary School                                                   Milwaukee - Middle School                                                       Parkside - High School                                                          Platteville - High School                                                       Superior - Elementary School                                                    Stevens Point - Elementary School                                                                                                                          Programs at each of the sites include appropriate content                       courses, laboratory-based activities and a structured follow-                   up schedule insuring support for these participating                            teachers.  A network will also serve as an initiator for                        similar Centers at additional campus sites throughout the                       state.                                                                                                                                                          Cost-sharing equal to 96% of the amount funded by NSF has                       been added to the program by the contributing partners.",
