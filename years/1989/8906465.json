 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests a real time mass monitor for the measurement of          particles from a model combustor.  The particle mass monitor is to be           coupled to a halogen-specific detector for the analysis of                      organochlorine compounds, in particular polychlorinated                         dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF).              There is evidence that the formation of PCDD/PCDF may occur                     heterogeneously and may be catalyzed over fly ash.  Rate data for               these complicated reactions are virtually nonexistent.  A (almost)              real time mass monitor would measure particles coming off the                   combustor (soot, fly ash) and enable the determination of mass rate of          particle accumulation, total particle mass, and particle                        concentrations.  If one or more of these measures correlate with                levels of PCDD/PCDF or their precursors, a better understanding of the          heterogeneous processes leading to their formation may be obtained.                                                                                             The equipment purchased will complement and greatly expand the                  capability to perform quantitative experiments aimed at understanding           the formation of PCDD's and PCDF's from the combustion of chlorine              containing fuels.  A better understanding of the conditions under               which PCDD and PCDF are formed is vital for meaningful incinerator              design improvements that minimize their emission to the atmosphere.",
