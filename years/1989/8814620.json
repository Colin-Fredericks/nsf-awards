 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genetic structure of populations can range from one                    large interbreeding population with genetic variation distributed               throughout to a series of small interbreeding subpopulations                    which are genetically differentiated from each other.  The                      genetic structure of populations results from the interactions                  of gene flow, natural selection, and genetic drift and also                     influences how these evolutionary forces will affect that                       population.  The proposed research will determine whether natural               selection can cause genetic differentiation within forest tree                  populations by measuring mating system (i.e. the degree of                      outcrossing), local selection due to microhabitat, and population               genetic structure of two oak species, white oak (Quercus alba)                  and red oak (Q. rubra).  This study will be conducted over a                    three year period in an oak-hickory forest in central eastern                   Missouri.  Most of the research will be conducted within a 4 ha                 study plot which contains four types of microhabitat: north-                    facing slope, southwest-facing slope, west-facing slope, and                    bottom land.  Genetic structure will be described with F-                       statistics and other appropriate measures using enzyme genetic                  markers identified through starch gel electrophoresis.  The                     mating system for each species will be measured each year also                  using enzyme genetic markers.  Local selection due to                           microhabitat will be studied using a reciprocal transplant                      experiment.                                                                          The project addresses significant questions for evolutionary               biologists about the potential of local selection to influence                  population structure in angiosperm tree species which may have                  high outcrossing rates.  This study will also provide useful                    genetic information on an ecologically and economically                         significant genus in North American forests.  Oaks are a valuable               commodity for lumber and they provide crucial resources for                     wildlife.  Understanding the distribution of genetic variation                  within a forest species will help in determining sampling schemes               for forest management.  In addition, such information will help                 us understand the ability of increasingly fragmented forest tree                populations to respond to natural and human-induced stress.",
