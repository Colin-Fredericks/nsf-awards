 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intent of the project is to identify the biochemical                        mechanisms that control the differentiation of vegetative cells                 into heterocysts (sites of aerobic nitrogen fixation) in Nostoc                 spp. Dr. Meeks hypothesizes that heterocyst differentiation is                  under control of a global nitrogen regulatory system in the free-               living state, that may be superseded by a symbiotic specific                    system when Nostoc is in association with the bryophyte                         anthoceros. He proposes to continue characterization and                        complementation - to identify and isolate regulatory genes                      involved in heterocyst differentiation. The specific objectives                 include isolation of additional mutants with the pleiotropic                    phenotype of inability to grow with nitrate and N2 as nitrogen                  sources, but able to fix N2 in symbiosis. Such mutants will be                  characterized by analysis of classes of revertant (single site                  suppressor mutations). The mutant phenotypes will be complemented               by conjugational transfer of wild type or \"revertant\" DNA cloned                in E. coli or packaged in vitro in plasmids and transferred into                the Nostoc recipient by electroporation. complementing fragments                will be sequenced and compared to established data banks. They                  will also be used in physiological genetic studies with wild type               and mutant strains of Nostoc to define their role in                            differentiation.                                                                %%%                                                                             This study has implications for two areas. First it is a rare                   example of pattern formation in bacteria and therefore provides                 an example to study with the powerful genetic techniques                        available in bacterial system. Additionally, the cyanobacteria                  are important components of the environment and play a unique                   role as primary producers of reduced carbon and nitrogen. An                    understanding of how these processes are controlled is therefore                of general importance.",
