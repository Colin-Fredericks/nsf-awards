 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will investigate how a substance (hormone) from the brain         of a primitive fish, sea lamprey, controls reproductive functions.  This        substance from the brain is a protein called gonadotropin-releasing             hormone.  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone is present in all brains of all        vertebrates including mammals (which includes humans), birds, reptiles,         amphibians, and fish.  Most studies on this brain substance have been           done in mammals.  More information is needed in other vertebrates.  In          mammals, many analogs (related compounds to gonadotropin-releasing              hormone) have been made and used in research to test these proteins as          conceptive and contraceptive measures.  Some of these gonadotropin-             releasing hormone analogs are presently being used in therapeutic               clinical applications (breast cancer, prostatic cancer, etc.).  Before          these analogs could be made, numerous studies were (and are) necessary          for the basic understanding on how these substances function.                   Dr. Sower's studies will focus on the basic understanding of how this           gonadotropin releasing hormone works in a very primitive fish.                  Knowledge of the structure and function of this protein in vertebrates          other than mammals will further our understanding of reproduction in            vertebrates.                                                                                                                                                    In addition, these studies may lead to the development of gonadotropin-         releasing hormone analogs which could be used for controlling                   reproduction in sea lampreys.  One of the major goals of the Fisheries          Commission is the development of a lamprey control program that will            include not only the use of lamprey poisons in streams but also the             development of contraceptive methods for reducing the numbers of sea            lampreys in the Great Lakes Region.  These investigations will include          if gonadotropin-releasing hormone and analogs could be used to inhibit          by sterilization or control reproduction in lampreys as a complementary         method in maintaining numbers of lampreys in the Great Lakes.",
