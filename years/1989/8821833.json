 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop in                                computational methods and function theory to be held in                         Valparaiso, Chile at the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa                     Maria from March 13 - 18, 1989.  The U.S. organizer is                          Edward Saff of the University of South Florida and there                        are two Chilean organizers, S. Ruscheweyh and L. Salinas                        from the University in Valparaiso.  The participants                            consist of 16 from the U.S., 5 from Chile, 14 from South                        American countries other than Chile and 7 from Europe.  The                     principals from the U.S., Chile and Europe are very                             distinguished in the research area of the workshop, one                         which is developing quickly and is important to mathematics                     and its applications.                                                                                                                                           The workshop will provide an opportunity for the exchange                       of ideas and knowledge as well a chance for researchers in                      a common field to explore new discoveries and, important to                     the goals of the Science in Developing Countries Program,                       new common interests and future collaborations.  The timing                     is particularly good for this conference; there are many                        new developments to report and the inclusion of                                 participants from a number of countries will enhance the                        dissemination of that information and increase the benefits                     of the workshop.",
