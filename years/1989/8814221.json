 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will continue investigations of air-land-plant-                   water-human interactions in aggrading and disturbed northern                    hardwood forest ecosystems.  Historically, the Hubbard Brook                    Ecosystem Study has coupled long-term investigation of ecosystem                biogeochemistry and forest growth with detailed experimentation,                including laboratory and plot-level studies, whole ecosystem                    manipulations, as well as the development and application of                    computer models.  Studies of precipitation inputs, ecosystem                    pools and stream outflow will be continued.  This long-term                     biogeochemical research will be integrated with ongoing and                     proposed process-level studies through the development of proton                budgets and analysis of element cycle interactions.  The research               includes two new initiatives.  First plot- and watershed-level                  chemical manipulations using (NH4)2SO4, H2SO4, Na2SO4 and CaSO4                 will investigate present-day, anthropogenically-induced changes                 in hydrogen ion, sulfur, nitrogen and metallic cation cycles.                   Second, the research will test a new hypothesis relating the                    timing of plant growth and physiological processes to regulation                of hydrological and nutrient export.  Research on northern                      hardwood forest ecosystems at Hubbard Brook is a multi-                         investigator-/multi-institutional effort.  Most work will be                    conducted at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, yet the                 concepts and processes to be investigated are generally                         applicable to many types of ecosystems.  This research will, as                 in the past, contribute to the fundamental understanding of                     forest ecosystems and yield information useful to the better                    management of their valuable natural resources.                                                                                                                 The project team is excellent and comprises proven collaborative                performers.  USDA/Forest Service collaboration is quite positive.               Institutional accommodations are first-rate.                                                                                                                    The Ecosystem Studies Program confidently recommends that this                  collaborative, four-year continuing award be made.",
