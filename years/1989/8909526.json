 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last few years have been witness to renewed interest in the                 analysis of models of growth because of recent contributions of                 the basic capital model to our understanding of a wide variety of               economic phenomena.  This project develops convex models of                     endogenous growth with special emphasis on the following areas:                 (1) the analysis of the determinants of growth and the                          possibility of sustained growth; (2) the study of the process of                innovation or new product development; and (3) the study of the                 dynamic effects of taxation.  The project explores the                          connections between these three areas and extends this work into                open economy settings.                                                                                                                                          This research should provide new insights into economic growth,                 technological change and tax policy.  Previous work by the                      investigator tying the literatures on dynamic taxation and the                  determinants of growth demonstrates that different tax policies                 and trade policies can generate permanent differences in the                    growth rates of different countries.  This project will extend                  the past work with special emphasis on the effect of market                     power, education and different economic policies on sustained                   economic growth in an open economy.",
