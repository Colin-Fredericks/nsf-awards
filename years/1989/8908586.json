 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops algorithms and architectures for high-speed               implementations of digital signal and image processing applications.            Based on previous results on lookahead, decomposition, and incremental          computation techniques for hardware-efficient implementation of high-           speed linear recursive and adaptive digital filters, a method is                developed to transform these algorithms into equivalent forms, which            can operate at sample rates beyond the inherent limits in the original          algorithms.  Extensions are being carried out on these techniques to            nonlinear recursions, such as dynamic programming, quantizer loops,             adaptive differential pulse code modulation, and adaptive decision              feedback equalization.  Implementations for these algorithms in bit-            serial, nibble-serial, and bit-parallel architectures are currently             under study.                                                                                                                                                    The computational needs in many real-time signal and image processing           algorithms can only be met by dedicated implementations.  Success of            dedicated designs require appropriate choice of algorithms                      architectures, and implementation methodologies.  A complete                    examination of the algorithm and architecture approaches, as studied in         this project, will provide the application-specific designer a wide             design space, which can be exploited to obtain more efficient                   implementations.  This research will impact future integrated design            environments for VLSI implementations of dedicated signal and image             processing applications.",
