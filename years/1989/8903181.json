 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effect of the clumping of matter on the form that Einstein's                equations should take on various scales (e.g. those including                   stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies) will be explored.  It                is already clear from work done on the first two of these scales,               that such parameters as the rate of expansion of the universe, as               estimated from observations, will be affected.  Before                          quantitative estimates of such effects can be made, it will be                  necessary to refine the procedures used for averaging quantities                in the Einstein's equations over a discrete matter distribution.                A Swiss-cheese model will be used for the galaxies, rather than                 the almost-point model used so far, and this can be extended to                 clusters of galaxies.  Such clustering must obviously be taken                  into account.  Filament-void structure may also be investigated                 eventually, using computer simulation to find an appropriate                    probability distribution.  The other refinement needed is finding               a more realistic stress-energy tensor for a galaxy, and                         afterwards for a cluster.  The zero-pressure dust model used so                 far was sufficient to establish the general nature of the                       results, but not to allow evaluation of constants in the                        expression for the rate of expansion of the universe.",
