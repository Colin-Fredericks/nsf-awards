 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Cincinnati has several researchers who would                benefit from access to supercomputers and access to other                       researchers connected to the NSFNET.  These scientists constitute               a growing number of faculty and graduate students who require                   advanced computing facilities in order to carry out their                       research.  The campus requests a portion of the funds needed for                equipment for connection to the NSFNET through the State of Ohio                communication network centered at Ohio State University.                                                                                                          Consistent with the NSFNET Program policy regarding connection                to existing mid-level networks, this grant is an award of $20,000               for routing equipment at the campus, which will be used as a                    gateway to networks external to the campus.  Connections to the                 Ohio State University hub will be provided by the University of                 Cincinnati.  Ohio State University is connected to the NSFNET                   Backbone network as member of the the CICNET regional                           (multicampus) network and as such has computer communication                    capability with all institutions currently connected to the                     nation research network, NSFNET.",
