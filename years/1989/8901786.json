 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in plant                               pathology to be conducted by Ronald Brlansky of the                             University of Florida Citrus Experiment Station and                             Maria Julia G. Beretta of the Biological Institute of                           Sao Paulo, Brazil.  They will characterize amorphous                            occlusions in citrus trees which have citrus blight in                          Florida and declinio in Brazil.  These diseases cause                           a loss of 60 million dollars in the U.S. and 7 million                          in Brazil yearly through reduced water uptake caused                            by amorphous plugging.  These plugs are similar in the                          two diseases.  The chemical composition of the plugs                            will be determined which will help in the search for a                          causal agent.                                                                                                                                                   This problem is clearly of interest to both countries                           and therefore is a good example of how mutual benefits                          can be derived from a collaboration between scientists                          from the U.S. and Brazil.  Previous work has resulted                           in progress on the enzyme degradation of the xylem                              occlusions and their formation in the xylem tissues.                            The methodologies of both researchers will be                                   exchanged and both the blight and declinio compared to                          aid in the discovery of the causes and to develop                               tools for the detection of diseased presymptomatic                              trees.",
