Conduct of immediate post-earthquake investigations has                         improved technical knowledge of earthquake effects and                          has provided significant new information leading to                             improved building practices, thereby contributing to                            the reduction of earthquake losses.                                                                                                                             The scope of the EERI Learning from Earthquakes Program                         will continue to involve three principal activities:                                                                                                               l)  Conducting post-earthquake field investigations;                            2)  Providing a clearinghouse for post-earthquake                                   field investigations; and                                                   3)  Disseminating the lessons learned through public                                briefings and special reports.                                                                                                                           EERI will obtain increasingly focused information about                         the effects of earthquakes on the built environment and                         the concomitant ramifications in the societal arena;                            document findings from those investigations; improve                            procedures and guidelines for conducting future                                 investigations; and broaden the dissemination of                                lessons learned to researchers, practicing engineers,                           and others concerned about reducing future earthquake                           losses.",
