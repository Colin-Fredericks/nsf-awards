 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers in many of the social and behavioral sciences often                 need to analyze the data of a complex experiment into a few                     essential features or trends, in order to ascertain the essential               dimensions of variations in the phenomenon under investigation.                 Methods involving the mathematics of geometry can be very helpful               in this regard, because they can provide the experimenter with                  potentially enlightening graphic representations of the data.                   There has been relatively little development of truly geometrical               methods tailored to those fields.  Useful techniques have been                  developed (e.g., factor analysis, multidimensional scaling) which               are sometimes labeled `geometrical'.  However, these techniques                 are based on extremely strong models (i.e., based on very                       restrictive assumptions), in which the geometry of the                          representing structure plays only a minor role.  Moreover, the                  fundamental assumptions of these models are not easily testable,                so that it is never quite clear how much of the results of the                  analysis have been forced upon the experimenter by the method                   itself.  This research will remedy this situation and provide a                 collection of purely geometrical models suitable for a very                     general experimental setting in use by social and behavioral                    scientists.  The experimental method is a variant of the so-                    called `method of triads', but the interpretation of the data                   differs drastically from traditional ones.  The mathematical                    developments are largely based on the methods and concepts of                   modern geometry.  One of the advantages of this approach is that                the models tend to be weaker than traditional ones (i.e., to                    involve less restrictive assumptions) while being easily                        testable.",
