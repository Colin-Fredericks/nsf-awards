Marshall Institute of Human Origins, Berkeley, California and Dr.               Christian de Muizon of the Institute of Paleontology, National                  Museum of Natural History, Paris, France.  Drs. Marshall and de                 Muizon have worked together successfully in the past in the                     collection of mammals and other vertebrates from the Late                       Cretaceous age El Molino Formation in Bolivia.  The investigators               now propose to prepare two monographs on some the most important                species in the oldest mammalian faunas of South America.                                                                                                        Monograph 1 will be on specimens of Alcidedorbignya inopinata--the                                                  _______________ _________                   earliest, smallest, and most generalized member of the order                    Pantodonta known.  Monograph 2 will be on specimens (including                  complete skulls and nearly complete associated skeletons) of the                didelphid marsupial Pucadelphys andinus.  A. inopinata is the most                                  ___________ _______   _  _________                          abundant placental, and P. andinus is the most abundant marsupial                                       _  _______                                              in the Tiupampa fauna.  Preparation of both monographs will                     involve:  1) assessment of dental variation within each species; 2)             assessment of possible sexual dimorphism within each species; 3)                detailed descriptions of all dental, skull, and postcranial                     elements; 4) comparative descriptions and assessment of phyogenetic             affinity with other taxa; 5) assess functional aspects of the                   skeletons of Pucadelphys; 6) make photographs for study and                                  ___________                                                        publication; and 7) discuss the evolutionary and biogeographic                  importance of each species.  The results of this work should be of              great interest to scholars of mammalian evolution.",
