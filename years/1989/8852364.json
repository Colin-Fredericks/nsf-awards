 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Florida has a strong research group in the area of            Computer Vision.  Undergraduates at the university, however, currently          have no exposure to this increasingly important field of study.  They           plan to offer an upper level undergraduate course in Computer Vision to         familiarize students with this area.  It is their contention that               without access to near-realtime computer processing and display                 capabilities, such a course has little relevance; it is critical that           one learn what the qualitative and quantitative behaviors of various            computer vision algorithms are by directly manipulating high resolution         imagery.  Their current equipment holding prohibit them from offering           such a course to a reasonable size class (twenty of so) of                      undergraduates.  To support this coursework, they are seeking funds to          purchase a small group of workstations.  These workstations will be             used for laboratory support of the undergraduate computer vision class.         The class and laboratory work envisioned will give undergraduates an            opportunity to bring together many of the concepts that have been               conveyed to them in their mandatory course work in a fascinating field          of study.",
