 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the unfortunate but fundamental features of aging is the                 decline of recent memory, that is, the retention of newly                       acquired information.  In order to understand this age-related                  memory loss, Dr. de Toledo-Morrell and her colleagues are                       carefully examining which types of memory decline with age, and                 studying how structural changes in individual synapses may                      contribute to senile (and possibly pre-senile) dementia.                                                                                                        Dr. de Toledo-Morrell has chosen an animal model of age-related                 memory dysfunction, recently identified in the Fischer 344 rat.                 Two-thirds of the members of this rat strain will spontaneously                 develop an impairment in spatial memory as they age.  As is seen                in the human amnesias, this rodent memory loss is also associated               with a disturbance in the function of the hippocampal formation                 of the brain.  Since not all members of this strain develop the                 memory impairment, the individual differences provide an                        excellent model for investigating the synaptic substrates of                    normal memory, and of its decline.                                                                                                                              This research project combines behavioral, electrophysiological                 and quantitative electron microscopic techniques to examine the                 neurobiological basis of the age-related memory deficit.  In                    addition, Dr. de Toledo-Morrell is providing a detailed analysis                of the effects of pentoxifylline (found to reverse the age-                     associated memory loss in some species) on the electro-                         physiological and morphological characteristics of hippocampal                  synaptic plasticity.",
