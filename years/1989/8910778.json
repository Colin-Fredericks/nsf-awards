 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad goals of this project are to understand how the brain                 encodes sound patterns and how the prior acquisition of some                    patterns influences the perception of others.  Experiments and                  computer simulations will provide tests of a theory of these                    processes.  The experiments will measure the speed and accuracy                 with which the perceptual system processes sounds as a function                 of the pattern within which the sounds are embedded.  The theory                holds that sounds will be processed more quickly and accurately                 and will be heard as more consonant when they occur in typical                  patterns than when they are in atypical patterns.  These                        experiments will provide objective measures of the perceptual                   expectations that depend upon the kinds of patterns to which                    people have been previously exposed.  The experiments will employ               digitally synthesized musical sequences.  A computer will record                the speed and accuracy with which a person judges whether or not                a designated sound is in tune.  Computer simulations will                       generate precise predictions about how a network of neurons in                  the brain could encode patterns and consequently influence the                  perception of other patterns.  The simulations will employ                      recently developed computational algorithms that model the                      organization of neurons into networks that exhibit intelligent                  behavior.  This project will focus on neural networks that can                  encode sequential patterns.  As an automatic consequence of                     encoding a large numbers of sequences, a network will learn the                 regularities inherent in the set of sequences as a whole.  The                  sequential expectations generated by the network will then be                   compared with those of people as measured in the experiments                    described above.  These results will contribute to our                          understanding of how the ability to learn sequential patterns                   depends upon the patterns to which we have previously been                      exposed.  The results will thus have implications for how this                  ability might be improved by an appropriate schedule of exposure.",
