 "awd_abstract_narration": "The stiffness and moduli of plant stems and tissue samples can be               measured from natural frequencies of vibration (=fundamental                    frequency and higher harmonics).  By measuring shifts in these                  frequencies as a stem is cut and shortened in length, and by                    comparing these shifts with those anticipated for different                     geometries, the extent to which a stem's morphology conforms to                 one of many competing geometric models can be determined.  An                   apparatus has been designed that can measure simultaneously all                 of the natural frequencies of a plant stem of tissue sample.                    Funding is requested to purchase additional instrumentation that                will facilitate data gathering analysis.  The equipment will                    allow the collection of biomechanical data having bearing on                    plant structure, development, ecology, and such practical aspects               as stiffness and resistance to compression.",
