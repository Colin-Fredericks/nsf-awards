 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project links properties of transversely vibrating                    mechanical systems with electromagnetic waves at radio                          frequencies.  Currently, there are few attempts in lower division               physics laboratories to demonstrate any of the properties of                    electromagnetic waves at radio frequencies.  In lower division                  laboratories, electromagnetic waves are presented in terms of                   oscillations of current and voltage in wires at audio frequencies               which leaves the student with the impression that electromagnetic               waves in space are a topic entirely separate from transverse                    mechanical waves, hidden from comprehension by a formidable                     mathematical formalism.  Understanding the similarities of                      electromagnetic waves to transverse mechanical waves gives the                  students an appreciation of the physical basis of electrical                    phenomena.  Concepts like impedance, reflection coefficient, and                matching are seen as general properties of all transverse waves                 and are not unique to electromagnetic waves.  Understanding the                 differences between electromagnetic waves and transverse                        mechanical waves leads the student naturally into the modern                    theories of electrons and relativity.  The major instruments to                 be purchases are Wiltron Model 6409 RF Analyzer.  The Wiltron                   Analyzer will be used to investigate.  A.
