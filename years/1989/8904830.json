 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meteorite impacts played a fundamental role in the evolution               of planetary surfaces in the early Solar System.  The present                   record of the early bombardment history of the Earth and                        terrestrial planets derives largely from studies of lunar rocks                 and cratering.  Studies to date by the principal investigator of                distinctive spherule layers in rocks of the Barberton Greenstone                Belt provide substantial evidence that they are parts of distal                 ejecta and condensate blankets produced by giant meteorite                      impacts on the Earth 3.2 to 3.5 billion years ago.  These                       deposits provide a direct source of information on impact                       mechanics, the processes by which impact debris is generated,                   dispersed and accumulates and the latest stages of terrestrial                  and planetary accretion.                                                             Comparison of the thickness of these Early Archean distal                  debris blankets, commonly 30 to 50 cm of virtually pure                         spherules, with terminal Cretaceous boundary spherule and clay                  layers suggests that the Archean impacts were of enormous size                  and must have had profound effects on early terrestrial                         depositional and biological systems.  The objective of the                      proposed research program is to evaluate through both field and                 laboratory studies the nature of these effects.",
