 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atmospheric sulfur cycle is controlled to a large                      extent by natural processes involving the release of biogenic                   sulfur gases into the troposphere.  An understanding of these                   processes is of importance to a number of global problems in                    atmospheric chemistry, including:  the origin of sulfur dioxide                 and sulfate aerosol in remote regions; the impact of sulfur                     gases on tropospheric oxidant cycles; the contribution of                       biogenic sources to acid precipitation in pH sensitive                          ecosystems; and possible long-term climate controlling                          feedbacks between greenhouse gases and cloud condensation                       nuclei.                                                                              This project will provide for a workshop to bring together                 many of the principal researchers who are making sulfur gas                     measurements in the atmosphere.  The purpose of the workshop is                 to discuss the present analytical and field scientific problems                 so that a successful intercalibration and validation of                         techniques and methods can be planned and developed in the next                 three years.  A successful intercalibration on the measurement                  of sulfur gases will be an important mechanism of determining                   the reliability of available research data on atmospheric                       sulfur chemistry to develop future strategies for studying the                  biogeochemical cycling of this environmentally important                        element.",
