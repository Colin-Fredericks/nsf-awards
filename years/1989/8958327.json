 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young investigator award will be used to support a            research program in high speed circuits and devices for picosecond and          millimeter-wave functions.  Electronic circuits and devices performing          time-domain (pulsed and other transient signals, logic) are an order            of magnitude poorer in performance (speed) than comparable circuits             and devices in narrowband millimeter wave systems.  This discrepancy            arises from both technological reasons (the bandwidth-efficiency                limitations in matching to lumped-element devices) and                          historical/economic factors (strong research funding and large markets          for narrowband microwave technologies used in radar).  There is now             strong demand for pulse and time-domain circuits operating on the 1-            100 ps time scale, in high-speed logic, multi-gagahertz fiber-optic             digital transmission, real-time high-capacity signal processing, and            instrumentation.  We will address these areas by concurrent                     development of novel circuit designs and the required high-speed                semiconductor devices.  In the first year of the program, we will               start development of devices and circuits for multi-gagahertz fiber-            optic transmission.  The bandwidth of semiconductor laser,                      photodetectors, and optical fibers has exceeded the capacity of                 digital decision, retiming, and multiplexing/demultiplexing circuits.           The required digital functions can be performed with diode switching            and pulse generation circuits similar to those previously demonstrated          for picosecond pulse generation and sampling.  A target goal for the            NSF program will be the first demonstration of working diode                    multiplexing circuits at the end of the first year.  The PYI funding            will then be used to support initial investigation and process                  development for fabrication of high-speed 3-terminal devices                    (heterojunction bipolar transistors or modulation-doped field-effect            transistors) to be used in novel high speed fiber-optic and                     millimeter-wave receivers and high-speed instrumentation.",
