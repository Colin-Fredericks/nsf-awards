 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a PYI award.  Dr. LeMaster is studying the protein,                     dienelactone hydrolase whose X-ray analysis has recently been                   carried out.  The combination of solution and crystalline                       structural analyses will prove useful for studying the enzymatic                properties of this protein which plays an important role in the                 ecological detoxification of chloroaromatics.  By means of                      nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the ionization state and                conformation of the active site residues of the enzyme can be                   monitored in the presence and absence of substrate analogs as a                 means of gaining a better understanding of the mechanistic                      properties of this important class of enzymes.                                                                                                                  High resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has begun               to provide solution structures of small proteins.  This technique               offers an important complement to X-ray crystallography in                      structural analysis in that macromolecules can be studied under                 conditions more closely approximating the physiological milieu.                 This will prove particularly advantageous in studying association               reactions such as protein-peptide and protein-nucleic acid                      complexes for which X-ray analysis has met with only partial                    success.",
