 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to strengthen manufacturing processes                and product design education in mechanical engineering schools in               the United States.  Manufacturing processes are typically taught                without significant laboratory experience, are taught apart from                product design, and do not integrate well other key disciplines                 such as stress analysis, materials selection, and component and                 product design.  This project will provide students with an                     experimental course which integrates mechanical design principles               with manufacturing processing principles in a structured                        analytical and experimental format, following a design for                      manufacturability concept.  The laboratory sequence requires CAD,               CAM and data acquisition software, that is microcomputer based, a               milling machine that can be externally controlled, digitally                    controlled testing machine, state-of-the-art process monitoring                 equipment including a video digitizing imaging system and tooling               dynamometry, and testing instrumentation.  All equipment selected               is capable of interfacing with PC's to provide for an integrated                approach of analysis, control and monitoring throughout the                     sequence.",
