Four groups (three                                    groups of disabled persons and a non-disabled                                   group) will be involved in the study.  A                                        static room will be set up to simulate the                                      effect of earthquakes on the interior room                                      objects and arrangements typically found in                                     residential dwellings.  After viewing an                                        audio-visual tape showing earthquake shaking                                    and effects, subjects will be asked to perform                                  different safety-related tasks that would be                                    carried out immediately after earthquake                                        impact.  The room simulator will be able to                                     reflect the after-effects of two levels of                                      earthquake shaking (low and high).

An attempt will be made to determine:                                                                                                                        a)   Whether disabled persons differ from                                            able-bodied persons in their ability                                            to carry out self-protective tasks;                                                                                                                        b)   Whether the type of disability is                                               related to task performance;                                                                                                                               c)   How earthquake intensity affects                                                occupants' ability to take self-                                                protective measures.                                                                                                                                  Analysis of variance techniques will be used                                    to analyze the data.  In addition to providing                                  data for quantitative experimental analysis,                                    the video tapes should be an important source                                   of qualitative data on the coping behavior of                                   building occupants following earthquakes.",
