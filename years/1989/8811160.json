 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will examine the general hypothesis that                  desertification has altered a previous, relatively uniform                      distribution of water and nitrogen by increasing their spatial                  and temporal heterogeneity, leading to changes in community                     composition and biogeochemical processes in Chihuahuan Desert                   ecosystems.  The Jornada Experimental Ranch (southern New                       Mexico), with a 75-year history of rangeland research, has                      documented extensive changes in vegetation cover - from perennial               grassland to several kinds of shrublands - which are one result                 of desertification.  The work will include measurements of net                  primary production, root growth, decomposition, soil water                      dynamics, surface hydrology, dynamics of animal populations,                    animal-produced soil disturbance, nitrogen cycling processes, and               stable isotope distributions of nitrogen and carbon in widespread               ecosystems, ranging from black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda)                       grassland, to desertified, persistent shrublands of creosotebush                (Larrea tridentata), tarbush (Flourencia cernua) and mesquite                   (Prosopis gladulosa).  A conceptual model of desertification will               be tested by long-term water augmentation and mechanical                        homogenization of water and nutrients.  Data from these studies                 will be used to parameterize process models.  Measurements of                   water, wind, and gaseous transport and run-on diversion                         experiments will provide data for a desert landscape model.  Data               derived from satellite remote sensing of vegetation and soils                   will be incorporated into a dynamic geographic information system               model of the Jornada Basin.                                                                                                                                     Institutional support remains excellent for the continuation of                 this project.  Facilities are very good.  The three-institution                 collaborative arrangement involving several investigators has                   been well thought out and should prove to be highly beneficial                  and productive.                                                                                                                                                 Results from this research project should yield major findings                  that are fundamental to the broad field of ecology.                             Additionally, results should be important to the future, better                 enlightened management of arid land resources.",
