 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a ROW Planning Grant to develop a more complete picture                 of the evolution of commercial bank lending to developing                       countries.  More specifically, the project focuses on the effect                of a country's nonpayment of debt on its subsequent credit terms                in the new loans issued and its subsequent credit terms in                      debt reschedulings.  The investigator constructs a model that                   focuses on borrowers' reputation to study interest rate dynamics                after defaults.  This is a significant contribution because                     existing models of borrower reputation assume that a defaulter is               never able to borrow again in capital markets which is not true.                In this project the investigator extends data bases employed in                 previous research to construct the data base necessary to                       investigate empirically the behavior of interest rates following                defaults in the Eurocurrency credit markets.  Creating a more                   comprehensive data base on the recent era of defaults is very                   valuable because past empirical work has been concentrated on                   earlier episodes of default by borrower nations.  Preliminary                   work by the investigator on partial data demonstrates that the                  recent defaults have had a different impact on the credit of                    borrower nations than earlier episodes.  Better data will permit                a systematic investigation of the reasons why recent defaults                   have had different effects on the capital markets than in the                   past.                                                                                                                                                           This planning grant should be supported because it improves the                 theory and the data on the timely and important issue of                        developing country debt.  The work completed under this project                 will lay the foundation for empirical studies by the investigator               of the many unresolved questions in this area.",
