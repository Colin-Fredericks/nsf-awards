 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop a set of composite indicators                 of international technological competitiveness.  Preliminary                    indicators have already been developed in a just-completed                      project by Viking Instruments and Georgia Tech.  These are                      based  on data from available statistical data sets and new                     data derived from expert opinion.  The data cover 20 countries                  through 1985.  Validity of the indicators and their utility for                 policy purposes appear promising based on initial analysis.                     The current project extends this work by: (1) augumenting                       the data from statistical series and expert surveys;                            (2) conducting sensitivity analyses on indicators developed;                    (3) analyzing the validity of the indicators by several methods,                including comparing the indicators against the several underly-                 ing dimnesions of competitiveness and comparing the ranking of                  countries on each new indicator against similar rankings using                  existing indicators; and (4) performing reliability tests on data               sets by tracing them back to their sources and on opinion data by               resurvey of respondents and analysis of interrespondent                         reliability.                                                                         The anticipated result is a set of practical indicators of                 technological comptetitiveness suitable for inclusion in                        subsequent editions of Science & Engineering Indicators.",
