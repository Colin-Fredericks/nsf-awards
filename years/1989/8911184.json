 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent success in preparing carbonyl complexes of palladium in                  the cages of sodium zeolite-Y using a \"ship-in-a-bottle\"                        technique potentially offers new catalytic processes                            exploiting both geometric and electronic properties of the                      zeolite.  In this work, palladium catalysts on zeolite-Y are                    prepared, including some that are highly dispersed and some                     containing palladium clusters.  These are characterized using,                  among other techniques, extend X-ray absorption fine                            structure, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,                             temperature-programmed reaction, and temperature-programmed                     desorption.  The exchangeability of carbon monoxide in                          gaseous, adsorbed, and ligand forms is determined using                         infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed isotope                        exchange.  Catalytic activity for methanol synthesis,                           neopentance conversion, and related reactions are measured.                                                                                                     The new class of catalysts investigated in this work is                         potentially revolutionary.  It should offer types of                            selectivity not available with catalysts presently in use for                   a number of industrial processes.  At present, it is difficult                  to predict how the activities of these new systems compare to                   those of older catalysts, but this effort should go a long way                  toward answering that.",
