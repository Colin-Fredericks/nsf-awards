 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to evaluate a new system for                  generating mutants in \u001aC.\u001a \u001aelegans\u001a, and to utilize this system to             generate mutants for genetic studies of embryonic differentiation               pathways.  The mutagenesis system is based on light.catalyzed DNA               crosslinking by trimethylpsolaren, and is thought to be biased                  toward modification of genes being actively transcribed.  This                  hypothesis will be tested in experiments designed to generate                   lethal mutations in genes which are activated during early                      embryogenesis.  Mutations generated in Linkage group II by this                 approach will be isolated, and characterized in comparison to                   known mutations generated by the action of ethylmethane sulfate.                Studies on the phenotypes of the most promising mutants will also               be initiated.  Possible bias toward active genes will be analyzed               by the effects of trimethylpsolaren applied at defined times                    during embryogenesis.  This research, which is highly exploratory               in nature, has the potential to provide a new, generally useful                 experimental system for the generation and analysis of                          developmental mutations.",
