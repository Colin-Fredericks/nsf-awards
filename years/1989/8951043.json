 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computer-based laboratory with a primary emphasis on research in              cognition is being developed.  With multipurpose computer interfacing           with lab instrumentation and with comprehensive software packages,              students are able to conduct experiments, computer simulations, and             exercises for lab classes accompanying courses in cognitive psychology,         physiological psychology, and psychology of learning and for                    undergraduate independent study and senior thesis research.  Labs in            cognitive psychology feature experiments on topics such as perception,          memory, and prose comprehension.  Electrophysiological recording and            other equipment used in physiological psychology labs give students             hands-on opportunities to study electro-physiological and                       neuropsychological factors of cognitive processing (e.g. evoked                 potentials.)  The grant also upgrades and improves current learning             labs; for example, it incorporates simulations of classical                     conditioning, experiments on concept formation, and biofeedback                 research.  Also, students interested in conducting their own research           have far more options than currently available.  In summary, this grant         gives students opportunities to become familiar with the use of                 computers and modern scientific equipment as well as helping them               develop the scientific skills and understanding necessary to                    participate more fully in the reserach process in psychology.  The              institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
