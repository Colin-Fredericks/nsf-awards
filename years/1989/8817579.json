 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal discusses a planned study for a 200-m deep ice core and           various surface sample collections to be made at, and in the vicinity of        Byrd Station, Antarctica.  The 200-m deep ice core is estimated to              represent approximately 10 centuries of snow accumulation.  It will             extend from the present snow surface and overlap the profile of the deep        ice core augered to bedrock there in 1967 and 1968.  The recovered core         and surface samples will be measured and analyzed for stable isotopes,          volcanic activity, megascopic stratigraphy, ionic concentrations, trace         metals, dust concentrations, gas content and composition, and physical          properties.  The entire investigation will provide new continuous               results for the last millennium for this scientifically important               Antarctic location.  Results will include updated information on the            short- and long-term changes in the accumulation record and climate             variability, the anthropogenic trends, the volcanic disturbances and the        variations in the chemical composition of the atmosphere as they are all        reflected in the deposited snow layers.  The various chronologies will          extend down to, overlap and be compared with existing records from the          deep ice core obtained at Byrd Station and other Antarctic locations.           Significant geochemical and climatological signals will be compared with        similar environmental records already obtained from studies of Greenland        ice cores.",
