 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program consists of exploring the interconnections                between (1) welfare economics, (2) social choice theory, (3)                    decision theory and rational choice, and (4) social ethics and                  the theory of justice.  Each of these fields can be strengthened                by taking more substantive note of the others.  To illustrate,                  welfare economics can benefit substantially from the progress                   recently made in formal social choice theory in accomodating a                  wide class of informational inputs  (including cardinality and                  comparability of different types and non-utility information in                 the form of liberty,  rights,  freedoms and living standards).                  It can also benefit from the wider ethical concerns in                          substantive theories of justice and from admitting a greater                    variety of norms and strategies of individual behavior in the                   presence of social interdependence.  Similarly,  rational choice                theory can be foundationally enriched by taking more explicit                   note of the agent's ethical concerns and of welfare-economic                    sophistication.  The reexamination of the foundations of social                 choice theory,  welfare economics and rational choice theory                    will be carried out in the first research phase of three years,                 followed in the next two years by a critical examination of the                 demands of an informationally richer approach to social justice.",
