Grigera and F. Vericat of the Physics                          Institute in La Plata, Argentina.  They will study the                          theory of ionic solutions in the bulk phase and near                            surfaces with the aim of finding simple, analytical                             expressions for the thermodynamic and structural                                properties.  One of these is the electrical microfield                          seen by an ion or molecule in solution.  This quantity                          plays a central role in the theory of chemical                                  kinetics and the spectroscopy of molecules in                                   solution.  The microfield will be investigated near a                           charged and structured electrode surface.                                                                                                                       This work will continue an extraordinarily productive                           collaboration over the last ten years.  Blum is well                            known for his work in the statistical mechanics of                              liquids and solutions.  The Argentine effort has built                          up a capable and active group.  Each side has a good                            track record and this collaboration is fundamentally                            important for the continued research productivity of                            both.",
