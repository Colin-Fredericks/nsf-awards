 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have recently identified chloroplast-derived DNA sequences                   in an intron of a tomato nuclear gene that we had cloned.                       Although it had been demonstrated, by hybridization                             experiments, that the nuclear genomes of many plants contain                    sequences derived from the chloroplast genome, this is the                      first example of the physical isolation of such integrates.                     Our analysis of the integrates and of the integration sites                     suggests the involvement of homologous recombination                            mechanisms in the transposition events.  In this proposal we                    outline experiments designed to physically isolate and                          characterize many chloroplast DNA integrates in the tomato                      nuclear genome.  The date obtained will be used to test the                     hypothesis that homologous recombination is involved in the                     transposition of such chloroplast sequences into the nuclear                    genome.                                                                                                                                                         The presence of DNA sequences integrated into the cellular                      genome which originated in the organelle genomes has been                       abundantly documented.  However, little or nothing is known                     about the mechanism(s) involved.  The results of this study                     should provide insight into those processes.",
