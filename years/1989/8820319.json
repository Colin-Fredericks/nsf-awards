 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Klein and Cruz.Uribe will analyze faunal materials collected               at three Pleistocene sites located in the western Cape Province                 of South Africa.  The largest of these, Elandsfontein, is a large               stratified site which over several decades of examination has                   yielded thousands of faunal items, as well as a hominid skull and               stone tools.  Although the site cannot be precisely dated, its                  earlier component falls within the Middle Pleistocene, roughly                  500,000 years ago, while its upper unit postdates this time.                    Some of the materials probably result from human activity while                 others can be attributed to other causes such as carnivore                      kills.  At two other sites in the region, Duinefontein and                      Springfontein, smaller assemblages have also been recovered.                                                                                                    In their analysis, Drs. Klein and Cruz.Uribe will identify                      species represented.  They will also study the break, cut and                   other marks on the bone in an attempt to determine causal                       factors.  The work will accomplish several important goals.                     First, it will increase understanding of mammal evolution in                    Africa over the last million years and provide a basis for                      relative correlation with sites.  Second, it will shed additional               light on early human activities in Africa and clarify the role of               hunting in these societies.  Finally, it will help develop                      standards to determine whether humans played a role in the                      accumulation of specific bone assemblages.                                                                                                                      This research is important for several reasons.  These                          collections constitute an important archaeological and                          paleontological resource and have not been properly studied.                    This work will remedy that situation.  It will also help                        archaeologists to develop an important set of analytical tools                  which will be useful in many parts of the world.",
