 "awd_abstract_narration": "This University of Oklahoma College of Engineering project involves             three separate but related components covering the total spectrum of            development and experience that a student needs in order to understand          the value and rewards of a career in research.  The three components            include a 1) Summer Academic Enrichment Program for minority high               school graduates, 2) a university based research experience, and 3) an          industrial based research experience.                                                                                                                           The Summer Academic Enrichment Program focuses on academic development          and introduction to research careers.  The overall goal for this                program is to assist the students in achieving their academic                   potential by having the participants enroll in six hours of college             credit including English and mathematics courses.  The participants             also are involved in writing and math labs each day plus Academic               Orientation and Person Development Workshops.  The second and third             components of the project include research opportunities for                    participants in both the university and in industry.                                                                                                            The project allows for flexibility.  Some participants may participate          in only one or two of the components.  However, the goal is to produce          students who have gone through all three components.  This project              should produce a group of talented minority students trained and                motivated to continue in research and graduate school opportunities.",
