Participants will work                        together with scientists, engineers, and historians to learn                    how such topics can be used effectively within current                          curricula to stimulate interest in science and technology.                      Examples will be used from Lowell history, which has national                   significance, using museum education techniques of                              experiential learning.  The teacher guides, usable in high                      schools throughout the country, will be distributed through                     the Tsongas Industrial History Center.                                                                                                                          The University of Lowell is contributing in cost-sharing an                     amount that is equal to 57% of the NSF award.",
