 "awd_abstract_narration": "The methods of population genetics will be applied to two                  main levels of the species.  The investigators will concentrate                 on making models that can lead to realistic predictions and                     explanations.  One part of the work will compare the fitness                    (survival and fertility) of individuals produced by inbreeding                  with the fitness of those produced by outcrossing to unrelated                  individuals.  Such comparisons allow estimates of \"inbreeding                   depression\", the fitness deficit of inbred progeny relative to                  the fitness of outbred progeny.  Inbreeding depression is very                  important in plant and animal breeding, and may also be important               in determining the evolution of breeding systems.                                    The genetic causes of inbreeding depression are not fully                  understood at present.  So studying populations which display                   both outcrossing and self-fertilization (as in most plant                       populations) should help to distinguish between the different                   possible mechanisms.  To do this, the investigators will study a                model in which many genetic loci affect fitness because the loci                are subject to mutations having deleterious effects on fitness.                 The investigators will make predictions about the relationship of               inbreeding depression and level of self-fertilization.  Then they               will compare these theoretical results with data from natural and               domesticated plant populations.                                                      Studies of how new species are formed will use models in                   which population randomly shifts from one equilibrium state to                  another.  Populations founded by a small number of colonists will               be used.  The process may be important in generating new species,               and has been much discussed recently under the name of \"peak                    shifting\".  Few studies of genetic models of the process have                   been carried out, but these studies must be done before it is                   known how likely peak shift is.",
