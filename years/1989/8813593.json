 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Vladimir Hlavacek of the Laboratory for                 Reaction and Ceramic Engineering of the State University of New York            at Buffalo (SUNY/B) in a research collaboration on metal matrix                 composites with Dr. B.F. Lux of the Institute for Inorganic Materials           Technology of the Technical University of Vienna.  The ultimate goal            of the collaboration between these two laboratories is to develop a             chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for manufacturing of ceramic            fibers with good mechanical properties and high values of thermal               expansion coefficients.  Current work by the SUNY/B group on CVD of             titanium diboride, titanium carbide or boron carbide on a carbon core           is one of the promising routes to manufacture an inorganic fiber with           such properties.  They are now interested in extending this work to             include beryllium compounds.  Basic engineering research is needed to           develop highly controlled processing operations and conditions that             will produce consistently high fiber strengths over long length and             with minimal coating defects.  SUNY/B has experience with CVD and               excellent facilities and experience working with various core                   materials to synthesize continuous monofilaments of different                   diameters, while the Austrian Institute has unusual expertise in CVD            processes and in working with ceramic materials including the                   beryllides.                                                                                                                                                     The ever increasing performance requirements of aerospace systems and           other classes of vehicles and machinery call for materials with low             weight, high strength, high stiffness and high temperature                      capabilities.  Metal matrix composites appear to offer these                    characteristics, but production of such advanced materials requires             substantial basic information about factors that control ductility              and strength, environmental effects, and interactions between fiber             and matrix in composites.  The proposed collaboration offers the                interdisciplinary mix of complementary skills and knowledge that is             needed to make progress in this strategically important field.",
