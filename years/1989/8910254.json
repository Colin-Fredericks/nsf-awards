Although much attention has focussed on the modulation of                       populations of ion channels during the terminal differentiation                 of specific sets of post-mitotic neurons, very little information               is available about the development of ion channel populations in                neural-lineage cells at earlier stages, when initial commitment                 to neural phenotypes occurs.                                                                                                                                    Dr. Moody will use patch clamp techniques to study this problem                 in the Xenopus embryo, at stages between the unfertilized oocyte                and the neurula.  He will examine the stages at which cells                     involved in the formation of the embryonic nervous system first                 express functional ion channel populations distinct from cells of               other fates, and then investigate the developmental processes by                which the electrical properties of the oocyte are transformed                   into those of cells committed to neuronal phenotypes.  Particular               attention will be paid to the roles of ion channel synthesis, the               modulation of pre-existing channels, and the spatial distribution               of ion channels over the surface of single cells in the early                   electrophysiological differentiation of the nervous system.",
