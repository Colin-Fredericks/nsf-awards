 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support cooperative research between Dr. George                 Sigel, Rutgers University and Professor Jacques Lucas, University               of Rennes-Beaulieu, France.  The objective of this project is to                develop new glasses and fiber optics waveguides based on halide                 compositions.  The joint program will include work on the new                   chalcohalide glasses for use in the extended infrared, as well as               new approaches for preparation of the more well-known heavy metal               halides.  The investigators will also focus on the assessment of                potential waveguide materials for use in the 8 to 14um range with               specific interest at 10.6um, as well as the evaluation of these                 materials for specialized applications, such as laser hosts with                selected rare earth dopants for glass activation.                                                                                                               Both the U.S. and French laboratories have significant expertise in             the proposed research area.  The University of Rennes carried out               leading work in the areas of halide glass chemistry, as well as in              glass synthesis and characterization.  Rutgers has strong                       capabilities in the areas of the fiber drawing of non-oxide                     glasses, the optical characterization of these waveguides and their             use in newly emerging applications.  The results of this joint work             should make an important contribution to optical glass fiber                    research.",
