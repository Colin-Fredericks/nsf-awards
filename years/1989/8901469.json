 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological membranes play a critical role in cell function by                   controlling the flow of both materials (nutrients and waste products)           and information (by determining to which chemical stimuli the cell is           responsive) between the cell and its environment.  Yet the physical             state of these membranes is subject to perturbation by changes in               temperature, and at cold temperatures, membrane constituents may, in            actuality, 'freeze' - a condition not compatible with the maintenance           of biological function.  In poikilothermic animals (animals whose body          temperature varies with environmental temperature), this problem is             circumvented by a process of physiological adaptation which replaces            membrane components formed at warm temperatures with more fluid ones at         cold temperatures.  In this way, membrane function can be maintained            over a wide range of body temperatures.  Thus cold-blooded animals are          unique in being able to produce functionally equivalent membranes of            different chemical composition at different growth temperatures.  For           this reason, the rainbow trout is an ideal model system in which to             study the influence of membrane composition upon membrane function.                                                                                             Three aspects of the above general problem will be explored in the work         proposed.  One focus is to determine the extent to which temperature-           induced changes in membrane lipid composition influence the ability of          a cell to respond to hormonal stimulation.  A second question is to             determine the extent to which a cell may regulate membrane function by          controlling the composition (primarily the pH) of the cytoplasmic               compartment in which membranes function \u0131cold-blooded animals exhibit           unique patterns of acid-base regulation as body temperature changes             which permit this question to be addressed in a more straightforward            manner than would be possible in a homeotherm!.  Finally, studies will          also be undertaken to identify the steps in membrane assembly that              permit the membrane to be restructured as temperature changes.                                                                                                  These studies will provide a better understanding of how the chemical           composition of a membrane influences its function as well as indicating         the types of structural modification effective in modulating specific           membrane activities.  Such results are of broad general significance            because of the importance of membrane-mediated processes in such                diverse functions as nutrient absorption by the intestine, excretion by         the kidneys, and the responsiveness of many body cells to hormones.",
