 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a cooperative effort among the                       following institutions and organizations in the Los Angeles                     Basin: six California State Universities--Los Angeles,                          Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Long Beach, Northridge, and                         Pomona; Community Colleges in East Los Angeles, Los Angeles,                    and Pasadena; and, several school districts in the Basin--                      Garvey-Alhambra-San Gabriel, Los Angeles, Pasadena.  The                        project consists of a set of coordinated activities, targeted                   throughout Metropolitan Los Angeles, designed to                                significantly increase the representation of minorities in                      careers in science, engineering and technology. The broad-                      based approach taken to solve the underrepresentation problem                   centers on the establishment of coalitions among colleges and                   universities, business and industry, public schools and                         community organizations.                                                                                                                                             Minority enrollment at the six CSU campuses totals                         25,000, with percentage of minority enrollment ranging from                     13% (CSU-Fullerton) to 47% (CSU-Dominguez Hills). The largest                   minority enrollment, nearly 6,400 (39%), is at CSU-Los                          Angeles. Minority enrollment in the Los Angeles Unified                         School District is 351,000 which is 59% of the total.                                                                                                                Each CSU campus in the Center acts as a node for a                         variety of activities which take place to ensure that the                       goals and objectives of the Center are carried out in a                         coherent manner.                                                                                                                                                     Taken as a whole, the Center functions as a bond that                      links together all levels of the educational pipeline, as a                     unique catalyst to develop synergism, as a context within                       which to develop and evaluate new ideas, as an exporter and                     facilitator in helping campuses to implement activities, and                    as the major node of a network of Southern California                           institutions and people. The Center also serves as the                          stimulus to coordinate and enhance the many valuable minority                   programs already in place at CSU campuses and their linkages                    with precollege levels. It will forge new levels of effective                   communication and of \"horizontal\" action pathways among                         participating institutions and organizations.                                                                                                                        The administrative structure for the Center provides an                    effective combination of focused leadership, distributed                        planning and flexible implementation through an Advisory                        Council which is the governing body for the Center, an                          Executive Committee, an Executive Director, four Task Forces,                   and a Corporate Advisory Board.                                                                                                                                      Elementary School Projects involve the development of                      Science Skills Centers in school districts contiguous to CSU-                   Los Angeles; a Summer Science Institute at CSU-Los Angeles;                                                                                                     and a Student Aides for Science in Elementary Schools Program                   at CSU-Northridge.",
