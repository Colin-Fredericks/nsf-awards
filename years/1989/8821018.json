 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to examine the processes that affect              concentrations of contaminants in the Greenland Ice Sheet.  The                 proposed work represents a continuation of research initiated at                Dye 3, Greenland; a one-year field sampling program began there in              August 1988 and is scheduled to continue until August 1989.  The                sampling program includes collection of aerosols and gases at                   frequent intervals, and collection of fresh and older surface                   snow.  In addition, real-time continuous monitors for aerosol                   light scattering, condensation nuclei, and ozone have been                      operating.                                                                                                                                                      The proposed project is a one-year effort that contributes to the               Dye 3 program in two ways.  First, limited snowpit sampling will                be conducted during the summer of 1989 at Dye 3.  This will permit              assessment of the changes in chemical composition of the snow                   during aging over periods of less than one year.  Second, the                   aerosol and snow samples collected during Dye 3 program will be                 analyzed for anions, cations and trace metals.  It is expected                  that the results of this project will assist interpretation of                  snowpit and ice core data, by providing information on the                      transport and deposition processes in Greenland.",
