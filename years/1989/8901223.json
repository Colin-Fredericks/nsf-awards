 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at                       Princeton University to establish a Research Experiences for                    Undergraduates Site.  An information package describing                         Princeton's summer REU program will be sent to over 350 colleges                and universities across the United States.  Special efforts will                be directed toward recruitment of minority students.  A faculty                 committee will select participants (mostly about to enter their                 senior year) by competitive criteria (academic record; letters of               recommendation; statement of purpose).  To demonstrate its                      commitment to the summer undergraduate research program,                        Princeton University has agreed to match funds to support up to                 three additional minority student: e.g., for every minority                     student selected to participate in the program, Princeton will                  donate monies to support a second minority student.  The REU                    program is modelled after the research-oriented component of                    Princeton University's undergraduate curriculum in Biology.                     Participants from other schools will visit in the spring, to meet               with several faculty members of their own choosing and to discuss               the research ongoing in their laboratories.  Participants will                  then select a faculty advisor, under whose guidance they will                   formulate a detailed research plan and be assigned specific                     readings from the primary scientific literature, to be completed                before their return at the beginning of the summer.  From June 15               through late August, they will conduct research under close                     faculty supervision and both hear and present research seminars.                Where merited, their results will published.  Each student will                 submit a written report about the progress of their research and                the impact of the program upon their career goals.",
