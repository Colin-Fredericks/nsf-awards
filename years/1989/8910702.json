 "awd_abstract_narration": "As media of communications, maps can relate more than just factual         geographic information.  They also can be constructed to convey a wide          range of other messages, including ideas meant to persuade viewers to           adopt specific political views.  Such constructions usually are subtle          modifications in emphasis rather than products containing inaccurate            information.  This doctoral dissertation research project will examine          the ways in which maps produced in Germany between 1919 and 1945 were           designed to convey political messages.  Through careful examination of          maps and related materials, the investigators will attempt to answer            the following questions:  What individuals and groups were involved in          the creation of politically persuasive maps, and what were the roles of         governmental agencies in contrast to private organizations and academic         groups?  For which audiences were these maps constructed?  What was the         scope of the political messages included in these maps?  How did these          maps influence public opinion?  Research to answer these questions will         include inspection of materials in archives in the United States and in         Germany.                                                                             This research will shed light on the specific ways in which maps           were used as means of political communication by a variety of groups in         Germany between the two world wars, thereby providing improved                  understandings of the processes operating in that nation during a               critical period in world history.  More importantly, the project will           elucidate the general ways in which maps have been produced,                    disseminated, and received as media of political persuasion, thereby            complementing understanding gained of the propagandizing processes of           other media.  This project also will provide an excellent opportunity           for a promising graduate student to expand and refine his basic                 research skills.",
