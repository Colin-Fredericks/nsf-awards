 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will determine the history of He, Ne and Ar isotopes               in the mantle, based on studies of diamonds and associated mantle               samples.  When this study was undertaken, it was believed by some               that certain diamonds bore records of pristine helium isotopic                  composition.  It is how seems unlikely that diamonds could carry                vestigial records of He composition at genesis of the Earth; most               likely diamonds having high 3He/4He ratios acquired their3He                    during their residence in the alluvium by cosmic ray                            interactions, or by interactions of radiogenic neutrons with                    lithium if present in the diamond at concentrations exceeding 1                 ppm.                                                                            Discovery of the cosmogenic 3He component in alluvial diamonds,                 observations of very large helium diffusivity in diamonds, with a               very strange release pattern, and other observations urgently                   warrant extension of helium studies, including Ne (and Ar)                      isotopes.  The isotopic composition of Ne may indeed have a                     bearing on the formation of old diamonds.                                       Also it is planned to determine cosmic ray exposure histories of                alluvial diamonds using 21Ne and 10Be as tracers.  The lab is set               up for 3He measurements; low blank systems were built under the                 previous NSF grant.  Neon isotopic measurements can now be                      carried out with the required precision since the Isotope                       Laboratory will soon be acquiring a triple collector N2-Ne mass                 spectrometer under a grant from NSF.",
