 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to upgrade a Model 470A gas-phase peptide                   sequencer to allow on line analysis of PTH derivatives.  This                   upgrade is requested so that sensitivity of the instrument will                 be increased and to automate parts of the analysis that are now                 done manually.  At least five investigators will make extensive                 use of the upgraded instrumentation.  The projects that will                    make use of this instrument include projects that are designed to               establish structure-function relationships in proteins.  In some                experiments, the sequence analysis will be used to confirm the                  results of mutagenesis experiments, i.e. to demonstrate that a                  given recombinant DNA gives rise to the expected protein                        sequence.  In other experiments fragments of proteins will be                   generated for sequence analysis to establish the nature of                      fragmentation occurring after limited proteolysis.  Another type                of experiment will involve sequence analysis of peptides that                   have been modified to allow identification of phosphoserine                     residues, which cannot be identified by sequence analysis of the                unmodified peptides.  Proteins that will be studied include                     glycogen synthase from rat skeletal muscle and from yeast,                      protein kinases, dihydrofolate reductase from several sources                   including forms that are generated by site-directed mutagenesis,                folate binding proteins, myofibrillar proteins, various mutants                 of transforming growth factorbeta obtained from cultured cells,                 and fragments of soybean lipoxygenase.  For many of these                       experiments, high sensitivity is critical since only limited                    amounts of peptide or protein will be available.  The requested                 upgrade of the peptide sequencer will provide this increased                    sensitivity needed for these experiments.",
