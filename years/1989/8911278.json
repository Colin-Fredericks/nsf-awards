 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to provide a better understanding of                how membrane proteins acquire their final structures.  The                      experiments analyze two \u001aE.\u001a \u001acoli\u001a cytoplasmic membrane proteins of            simple and complex topological structures, the \u001atrs\u001a serine                     chemoreceptor and \u001alac\u001a permease.  The research aims to help                    elucidate both how the transmembrane topological structures of                  these proteins are generated and how the topological structures                 fold in three dimensions into globular structures.  This research               tests new genetic strategies for elucidating the topological                    structures of cytoplasmic membrane proteins.  It also aims to                   analyze nonfunctional mutants to identify the sequence features                 of transmembrane segments that enable them to direct the                        establishment of topology, and to identify any cellular                         components with which the transmembrane segments interact in this               function.  The analysis relies on the use of \"sensor\" proteins                  whose enzymatic activities reflect the normal cellular location                 of the membrane protein domain to which they are attached in                    hybrid proteins.  The research analyzes how the topological                     structure of \u001alac\u001a permease folds into a globular structure using               mutants that are defective in the process.  Such mutants will be                identified as a subset of mutants unable to transport lactose, or               constructed \u001ain\u001a \u001avitro\u001a by altering amino acid residues found to be            conserved in evolution.",
