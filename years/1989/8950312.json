 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent progress in biology and geology has provided new insights                into the processes that have led to our earth as we find it today               and to the existing variety of life forms.  This work affirms the               view that the central for understanding life on earth is                        evolution. However, high school earth science and biology                       curricula do not adequately address the ways in which modern                    topics such as plate tectonics or molecular biology inform our                  understanding of this framework.  The Biological Sciences                       Curriculum Study (BSCS), in cooperation with the American Society               of Zoologists and the Geological Society of American, will                      design, develop, field test, and distribute print materials and                 an interactive videodisc on advances in our understanding of                    evolution for use in high school earth science and biology                      courses.  The materials will be designed for integration into                   biology and earth science curricula throughout the year rather                  than as a separate unit; this approach will promote the                         incorporation of evolutionary perspectives throughout the                       curriculum.  The materials also will acquaint students with                     \"science as a way of knowing\", by emphasizing such concepts as                  hypothesis formation, data analysis, and the tentative nature of                scientific knowledge.  Media Design Associates, Boulder, Colorado               will produce the videodisc and interactive software;                            VideoDiscovery, Seattle Washington, will publish and market the                 completed program.  Wards's Natural Science Establishment,                      Rochester, New York, will provide laboratory equipment and                      materials for all field-test schools and will be the official                   supplier of the materials when the program reaches commercial                   distribution.",
