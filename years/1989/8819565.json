 "awd_abstract_narration": "The visual environment is three-dimensional, but our information                about it is based on two-dimensional retinal projections.  This                 research will investigate two types of processes for recovering                 three-dimensional relationships from two-dimensional images.  The               first type of process recovers distances from the eye to features               in the environment.  The research will examine two examples of                  this type of process: stereoscopic vision and motion parallax                   (the perception that objects moving faster in the retinal                       projection are closer to the eye).  The second type of process                  recovers three-dimensional relationships among objects in the                   environment independently of distances from the eye.  \"Structure-               from-motion\" is the example of this type of process that will be                considered.  Perceptions based on structure-from-motion recover                 three-dimensional relationships among objects directly from the                 relative motions of the objects, assuming only that the objects                 are moving rigidly or at constant speeds.  Information about                    three-dimensional distances from the eye and information about                  three-dimensional relationships among objects must be integrated                to provide a complete perception of the three-dimensional                       environment.  Preliminary research has shown that structure-                    from-motion facilitates the use of stereoscopic information.  A                 series of five experiments will examine the basis for this                      facilitation.  Preliminary observations have also indicated that                similar relative motions projected at the eye may lead to                       different three-dimensional perceptions, depending on whether a                 motion parallax analysis (projected velocities based on distance                from the eye) or a structure-from-motion analysis (velocities                   based only on relationships among objects) is applied by the                    observer.  Three experiments will examine the conditions that                   determine which of these alternative interpretations is applied                 by human observers.  An understanding of how different types of                 information for perceiving three-dimensional relationships from                 two-dimensional images are combined has relevance to such                       questions as: Can people lacking stereoscopic vision when tested                with static displays demonstrate stereoscopic ability when motion               is added to the displays, and how should the three-dimensional                  environment be represented in artificial displays requiring                     accurate observer responses, such as flight simulator displays                  and aircraft displays that represent the virtual environment?",
