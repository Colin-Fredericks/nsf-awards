 "awd_abstract_narration": "Issues which are key to obtaining a fundamental understanding of                the charge separation process in bacterial photosynthetic                       reaction centers (RCs) will be investigated using time-resolved                 absorption spectroscopy of wild-type RCs, RCs having site-                      directed mutations and RCs chemically modified to remove or alter               a specific cofactor.  Dr. Holten plans to study unresolved issues               on the details of the involvement of the RC prosthetic groups in                electron transfer and open up new frontiers on the role of the                  protein, both static and dynamic, in the charge separation                      process.                                                                                                                                                        The reaction center is the photochemical heart of a                             photosynthetic organism.  The function of this membrane-bound                   pigment-protein complex is to transform light energy into                       chemical energy.  Understanding how the RC carries out its unique               role in photosynthesis has been the subject of intense effort                   since the RC from the bacterium Rb. sphaeroides was isolated                    about 20 years ago.  Recently the ability to investigate and                    understand the internal properties and operation of the bacterial               RC took a quantum leap forward as a result of the solution of the               three-dimensional structure of the RC complex from Rps. viridis.                Spectroscopic studies of the RC primary photochemistry have thus                been refocused to a more detailed and fundamental level and at                  the same time have taken on a much broader significance than ever               before.  The studies planned will yield diverse information that                is critical not only for elucidating the molecular mechanisms by                which the RC functions, but, also, will advance knowledge in the                areas of electron transfer, pigment-protein interactions and                    protein dynamics.",
