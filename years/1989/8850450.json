 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will promote computer equity for girls in middle                   school.  The first phase of the project will develop training                   materials that will enable school district computer                             coordinators to conduct faculty workshops on computer equity                    and to guide the implementation of computer equity strategies                   in schools in their districts.  These strategies are based on                   the premise that the best way to interest girls in computers                    is to introduce them first to elementary applications, such                     as word-processing and computer graphics, and then to lead                      them to higher-level uses.  The training materials will                         consist of a workshop Leader's Guide, a two-hour workshop                       that discusses the causes of the \"computer gender gap\" and                      summarizes strategies for closing it, and a three-hour                          workshop that examines these strategies in detail and                           develops a specific program for the participants' school.                                                                                                       In the second phase of the project, these materials will be                     pilot-tested in four school districts in New York State.  A                     computer coordinator and an administrator from each district                    will first attend a two-day training session that will                          prepare the computer coordinators to conduct the two                            workshops for teachers in their districts.  Each test school                    will then develop and implement its own computer equity                         program.  The project will be evaluated by its impact on                        girls' interest and achievement in mathematics, science, and                    computer science.  Data will be collected about voluntary                       computer use by boys and girls and about enrollments in                         elective courses in mathematics, science, and computer                          science.                                                                                                                                                        The Women's Action Alliance and the participating school                        districts are contributing an amount in cost-sharing that is                    equal to 26% of the NSF award.",
