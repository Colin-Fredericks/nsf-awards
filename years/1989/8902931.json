 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program will be supporting the                  research of Dr. Steven M. Weinreb of the Department of                          Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University.  Dr. Weinreb will                   be developing new methods of synthesizing heterocyles, an                       important type of chemical structure found in many complex                      structures.  These are found in many of the substances used in                  modern agriculture and medicine.                                                                                                                                Synthetic methodology and natural product total synthesis based                 upon N-sulfinyl dienophile Diels-Alder cycloadditions will be                   pursued.  The methodology will specifically be applied to                       synthesis of the Nuphar alkaloid 7-epi-anhydronupharidine.  In                  addition, an intramolecular version of the procedure will be                    utilized for the stereoselective synthesis of vicinal diamines                  in a new total synthesis of capreomycidine.  This is a                          component of the antibiotics capreomycine and the                               tuberactinomycidines, and will be used in an efficient                          synthesis of streptolidine, which is a member of the                            streptothricin antibiotics.  A stereoselective synthesis of the                 vitamin biotin will also be developed using this Diels-Alder                    based methodology.  A new procedure for synthesis of vicinal                    diamines will be investigated via metallation of cyclic                         bis-imines.  A novel variation of the Heck reaction will be                     studied in order to efficiently synthesize saturated nitrogen                   heterocycles.  Moreover, nickel metallacycles derived from                      alkynes and carbon dioxide will be investigated in order to                     develop some generally useful synthetic methodology.  These                     metallacycles will be utilized as beta-acylvinyl anions and                     their reactions with several types of electrophiles will be                     tested.",
