 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eubank proposes to examine a number of problems in                         nonparametric regression.  One of the most interesting is the                   problem of robust spline smoothing.  The typical spline                         estimator of a regression function is found by minimizing a sum                 of squared errors plus a penalty function.  However the sum of                  squared errors is highly sensitive to outliers.  By                             substituting absolute error for squared error (or another                       appropriate function of the error) one can make the estimator                   more robust to outliers.  Eubanks will examine the effect of                    incorporating and estimating a scale factor for the error terms                 in these more appropriate and general functions of the errors.                  He will also examine jackknife confidence intervals for the                     underlying regression function.  These nonparametric regression                 models will also be applied to the traditional analysis of                      variance, analysis of covariance and intra-class regression                     models.  Another problem he will address is the incorporation                   of the covariance structure of order statistics in the                          estimation of quantile functions and their densities.                                The problem of relating two variables (such as height and                  weight) for pairs of observations on individuals is addressed                   by nonparametric regression.  Finding a functional relationship                 between the two variables is made considerably harder if some                   information is miscoded or extremely unusual individuals are                    included in the data.  Eubank will investigate methods of                       finding functional relationships that will be less sensitive to                 outliers in the sample and more representative of the whole                     population.",
