 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objectives of these studies on flower form and                      function are (1) to establish how floral organs grow and how                    their growth is modified in the evolution of new forms; and (2)                 to determine how pollen tubes grow in the style.  Specifically,                 Dr. Lord is continuing the surface growth analyses begun on lily                floral organs, extending them to the leaf and to the tobacco                    flower.  She will continue to screen for and select out                         established floral mutants of Arabidopsis that show modifications               in floral form that appear heterochronic in nature, affecting the               perianth and androecium form and mimicking the developmental                    patterns exhibited by both dimorphic flowers of cleistogamous                   species and those of inbreeding species. Dr. Lord will determine                whether differences in protein composition between the dimorphic                flowers of Collomia correlates with the histological divergence                 observed in the anthers and corollas of these two floral types.                 In the area of pollination, she will continue studies of the                    interaction between the pollen tube and the stylar medium                       establishing whether a matrix-driven translocation of pollen                    tubes occurs in compatible pollinations.                                        %%%                                                                             The flower is determinate in its growth, producing a serial                     progression of different parts from embryonic tissue, each                      showing discrete stages of differentiation, making it an ideal                  system for studying morphogenesis and growth of plant organs.",
