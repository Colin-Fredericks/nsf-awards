 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is supporting the                       research of Dr. Paul J. Scheuer of the Department of Chemistry                  at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  This research will                       continue the studies of the chemical communication system used                  by marine organisms in their interactions with each other.                      These studies will help us to understand better our impact on                   the marine environment.                                                                                                                                         Investigation will continue into the source of cyanide ion and                  into the pathways of terpene biosynthesis for the production of                 isocyanoterpenes in sponges. Ciocalypta sp. and Acanthella sp.                  will be analyzed for free amino acids and labelled amorphane                    prepared to carry out incorporation experiments.  Cell-free                     extracts will continue as the method of choice.  Other                          biosynthesis experiments are planned to trace the origin of the                 alkaloid, shermilamine A, in a tunicate, Trididemnum sp.                        Metamorphosis of larvae of the nudibranch Phestilla sibogae is                  induced by a substance elaborated by the prey of the                            nudibranch, the stony coral Porites compressa.  Attempts to                     isolate, purify, and characterize the inducer will be continued                 in a collaborative effort with Professor M. G. Hadfield and his                 research group.  Specific predator-prey relationships are                       common among coral reef invertebrates.  The molecular basis of                  a number of these systems is now known.  However the                            substance(s) which provide the initial attraction and/or the                    feeding stimuli are unknown.  These questions will be addressed                 with the sponge-nudibranch pair Dysidea fragilis-Hypselodoris                   infucata.",
