 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will concern mathematical logic and its                        connections with other areas of mathematics, especially algebra                 and analysis.  C. Ward Henson will study the model theory of                    the exponental function and will apply nonstandard analysis and                 techniques from model theory to the study of Banach spaces and                  other topics from analysis.  In addition, he will attempt to                    determine the computational complexity of various specific                      first-order theories and to characterize those theories which                   are computable in polynomial space.  He will also investigate                   highly homogeneous structures and their groups of                               automorphisms.  Carl Jockusch will work in classical recursion                  theory and in particular will study the degrees of                              unsolvability of diagonally nonrecursive functions, relative                    recursive enumerability, and recursively enumerable degrees                     relative to which certain permitting arguments may be                           performed.  Lou Van den Dries will study algebraic decision                     problems such as the word problem for commutative rings and the                 problem of finding generators for the group of units of a                       finitely generated commutative ring.  He also will continue his                 work on definability in algebraic-analytic structures.                               Some of the investigations will refine the techniques of                   mathematical logic, and some will apply them to questions often                 viewed as theoretical computer science or as algebra.                           Jockusch's work will be of the former kind, while a portion of                  Henson's and of van den Dries' work will be of the latter.  For                 example, Henson will continue to assess the relative complexity                 of different mathematical theories and will seek ways to                        recognize easily ones with lower measures of complexity.",
