 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John Beaman proposes to complete the preparation of a                  published inventory (constructed from a microcomputer database)                 of the plant species on Mt. Kinabalu in Borneo, Malaysia.  Mt.                  Kinabalu may support the world's highest diversity of plants per                unit area, and there are many controversies surrounding the means               by which this extraordinary diversity arose and has persisted.                  Dr. Beaman has completed the identification of more than 16,000                 specimens and has developed a microcomputer database for data on                the specimens, their taxonomic identities, and their geographic                 locations.  The locality data provides the means by which plant                 distributions can be analyzed relative to soil type, geology, and               other environmental factors.  Dr. James Beach will devote 18                    months to developing research capabilities for the inventory                    using a Geographic Information System (GIS) at Michigan State                   University.                                                                          The proposed research has implications for our understanding               of the southeast Asian flora, for conservation efforts in the                   region, and for general questions regarding plant ecology,                      diversity, and evolution.  Parallel development of the specimen                 database and GIS applications will break new methodological                     ground for the botanical community as a whole.",
