 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Delaware Valley Faculty Exchange is a regional collaborative of             colleges and universities designed to break down the isolation too              often felt by faculty at undergraduate teaching institutions by                 integrating them into a regions that contains several outstanding               universities, the largest scientific research park in the country,              numerous medical schools, teaching hospitals and pharmaceutical                 companies.  A regional faculty seminar for 35 science faculty is being          introduced in an attempt to build a set of enduring relationships               between research faculty and their colleagues who teach at                      undergraduate institutions.  The creation of a Biological Basis of              Behavior; Motivation and Perception Faculty Seminar, with an added              summer practicum component for eight of the faculty is a first step.            It is expected that the faculty seminar for the natural sciences will           provide a regional means of linking teaching faculty with their                 colleagues, enrich the understanding of teaching faculty of the kinds           of research that is going on in the Delaware Valley and at the                  periphery of their discipline and encourage change in the undergraduate         teaching of science.  Additional funding is being provided by the               University of Pennsylvania and by the individual colleges involved.",
