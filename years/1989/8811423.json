 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to build a tool-based software laboratory to                  facilitate experimental research in distributed and parallel computing.         The laboratory has three major components: a collection of high-level           tools to aid in the development of distributed and parallel algorithms,         a programming language workbench, and a configurable operating system           kernel.  The long term goal is to use the laboratory as a vehicle for           addressing several problems fundamental to the design and use of                distributed and parallel systems.  These problems range from                    implementing parallel algorithms that exploit alternative                       architectures, to understanding the principles of interprocess                  communication and synchronization across a wide spectrum of                     architectures, to designing system software that exploits the                   heterogeneity and redundancy inherent in distributed and parallel               architectures.  In addition to this long term goal, designing and               implementing the laboratory will allow investigation of two                     complementary issues.  First, the problem of building powerful and              efficient tools is interesting and challenging research in its own              right.  Each tool must be general enough to support a wide range of             applications and at the same time must be efficiently implementable on          a wide spectrum of underlying architectures.  Second, the breadth of            the laboratory will allow study of the interaction between system               components.  In particular, how high-level tools for designing parallel         algorithms depend on the language support systems, and how these                systems, in turn, depend on the communication support provided by the           kernel.",
