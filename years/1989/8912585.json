 "awd_abstract_narration": "A nuclear physics program on spin excitations of the                       nucleus will be carried out by intermediate energy inelastic                    electron, proton, and pion scattering.  New initiatives will be                 taken towards the study of short range correlations.                            Complementary studies will focus on unnatural parity states                     such as \"stretched\" excitations where the dominant coupling                     between the probe and the nucleus is the nuclear spin density.                  Not only can we test models of structure calculations but also                  test selected effective interactions within the DWIA model of                   inelastic pion and proton scattering.  In addition (e,e')                       measurements are being extended to higher momentum transfer for                 selected excitations in order to study the importance of                        higher-order effects such as meson exchange currents,                           relativistic effects, and short range correlations.                             Electromagnetic studies of charge density transitions in light                  nuclei, through photon and electron induced multi-nucleon                       knockout reactions.  Presently, a highly modular plastic                        scintillation hodoscope, together with a charged particle                       magnetic filter for background reduction and lead-scintillation                 shower counters for electron/photon-neutron discrimination, is                  under development as a large angular acceptance, high                           efficiency, medium energy resolution (time-of-flight_ neutron                   detector for use at LEGS, LAMPS, Bates, and eventually CEBAF.",
