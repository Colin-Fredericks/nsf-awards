 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project within the Organic Dynamics Program in the                      Chemistry Division, Fred Menger of Emory University will                        investigate the physical and chemical properties that result                    when interacting systems are forced, and held, into close                       proximity.  This study will provide insight into the function                   of naturally occurring systems that have such proximity as,for                  example, enzymes.                                                                                                                                               This study encompasses three different projects all having                      \"enforced proximity\" as the common thread. The first will                       examine ion movement in monomolecular films.  Although films                    are of key importance to science and technology, there is only                  one recent example, coming from Japan, attempting to measure                    migratory aptitudes in a monolayer. The Emory group has                         operational a film balance and auxiliary equipment, installed                   in a clean room, which will permit conductivity measurements in                 films of varying structure and at varying levels of pressure.                   The second project involves an examination of the dynamics of                   systems in which electrostatic forces (or a combination of                      electrostatic and hydrophobic forces) hold a catalyst in                        proximity to a substrate.  One of the enzyme \"models\" is                        structurally related to an extremely efficient intramolecular                   reaction where an amide hydrolyzes at pH = 7, 25 degrees with                   an effective molarity of 10exp-14 M.  Finally, the Emory group                  will synthesize and examine \"reverse surfactants\", a new type                   of amphiphile which can aggregate in water, as does a                           conventional surfactant, but not without exposing hydrocarbon                   patches to the solvent (i.e., not all the hydrocarbon chains                    can ever be buried within the assemblage).  A multi-method                      approach, relying heavily upon dynamic light scattering and                     NMR, will be brought to bear on the problem of characterizing                   aggregates of the reverse surfactants.",
