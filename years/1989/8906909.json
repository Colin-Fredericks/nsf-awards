 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data dependence is the theoretical cornerstone on which all automatic           parallelism detection methods are built.  Automatic vectorization,              which has been critical in the use of vector computers, and other               advanced optimizations for new parallel computers and languages all             require data dependence information.                                                                                                                            Our project will measure both the effectiveness and the efficiency of           data dependence decision algorithms.  Effectiveness will be measured by         counting the number of loops that can be vectorized and concurrently            executed.  Efficiency will be measured by computing the time taken to           build the data dependence graph.  Efficiency must be carefully defined,         since a quick data dependence decision algorithm may add more arcs to           the dependence graph, thus slowing down other phases of the compilation         which depend on the number of arcs in the graph.",
