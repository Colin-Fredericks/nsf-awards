 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal relates to the investigation of                                   nanostructures for use in lightwaves and photonics.  The                        specific issues which are proposed for investigation                            include computational simulation, new super-radiant                             coherent sources, the integration of a laser and a high                         frequency modulator on the same chip, and the initial                           investigation of electron beam writing techniques                               for the investigation of quantum optical devices.                               The team propagation technique will be applied for the                          computation of quantum processes and will begin with the                        calculation with quantum well devices and then will be                          extended to a calculation of non-linear optical                                 properties of artificial structures by applying this                            technique to a computation of double Feynman graphs.  One                       possibility is a coherent emitter based upon                                    super-radiant emission.  This effort will be pursued                            jointly with Tadashi Fukuzawa, IBM Research Laboratory,                         Japan.  Simulations have already been carried out for                           travelling wave GaAs modulators indicating that it is                           possible to have a response to 40 GHz.  If this is so,                          then it is of interest to have an integrated                                    laser-modulator within a single monolithic                                      structure.",
