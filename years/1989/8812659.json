The                              investigators will apply their theory to solutions of                           partial differential equations, estimates of error, problems                    of theoretical physics, and numerical procedures for solving                    mathematics models for singular perturbation problems.                                                                                                          This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution  in Yugoslavia, but                        include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
