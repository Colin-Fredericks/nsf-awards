 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evaluation component of the Industry/University                        Cooperative Research Center Program requires the evaluation to                  write a historical profile for each center each year.  Because of               the many different formats and structures used by the evaluators                in writing the historical documents, a rigorous cross-site                      analysis of the historical profile protocol and structure was                   designed.                                                                            This study addresses a cross-site analysis of the first wave               of data collected from this revised historical profiles.  The                   study will; 1) assess the ease of use, time requirements,                       comprehensiveness, local utility and other implementation issues                of the revised historical profiles, 2) summarize the major themes               and findings in each of the historical profiles sections to                     assess the ability to do cross-site analysis and 3) use the                     database to answer specific questions about Center operations and               outcomes.                                                                            The Principal Investigator and other researchers are                       recognized experts in evaluation theories and protocol.                              The Program Manger recommends that Dr. Craig Blakely be                    awarded $14,440 for one (1) year for this project.",
