 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Landweber will continue his study of elliptic                    genera and elliptic cohomology, a joint project with R. E.                      Stong (University of Virginia) and other colleagues.  A new                     family of periodic cohomology theories was shown to exist in                    1986, in joint work with Stong and D. C. Ravenel; their                         coefficient rings are rings of modular functions of level 2.                    The main problem, now widely recognized, is to determine the                    intrinsic geometric nature of these cohomology theories.                        Recently, F. Hirzebruch has defined level N elliptic genera (N                  at least 2), which for N = 2 become the elliptic genera leading                 to elliptic cohomology; it is intended to study these genera in                 detail.                                                                              Professor Tamanoi will study the internal infinite                         dimensional symmetries present in elliptic genera on Kaehler                    manifolds with varying degrees of speciality.  He proposes to                   explore the topological applications of these symmetries, and                   to study refined rigidity properties implied by them.  He                       approaches these problems via representation theory of affine                   Lie algebras.                                                                        Both investigators are bringing highly sophisticated                       algebraic theories to bear upon problems in the geometry of                     manifolds.  Applications include the theory of strings, which                   has been offered as a promising approach to quantum physics of                  systems of interacting particles.",
