 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enable twenty-four secondary school mathematics               teachers from Iowa to integrate discrete mathematics into the                   curriculum.  During the summer of 1988, Iowa EESA funds supported a             three-week workshop in which the participants studied graph theory,             difference equations, and combinatorics, discussed methods of teaching          these topics, and prepared for inservice sessions that they will conduct        in their own school districts.                                                                                                                                  The NSF award will increase the effectiveness of the EESA-funded                workshop by providing funds for follow-up activities during the academic        year and for evaluation of the project's impact.  These activities will         include 2 one-day meetings and a visit to each participant by the               project staff.  Evaluation will be based on examinations, site visits,          and reports from the participants.                                                                                                                              An amount equal to 183% of the NSF award is being contributed by the            University of Iowa and the state as cost-sharing.",
