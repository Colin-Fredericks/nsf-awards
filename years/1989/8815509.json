 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in molecular                     neurobiology between Dr. John P. Merlie, Washington University and              Dr. Emmanuel Jover, Unite de Membranes Biologiques et Toxines                   Animales, French National Center for Scientific Research,                       Marseille, France.                                                                                                                                              Preliminary experiments employing cDNA cloning indicate the                     existence of at least four mRNA's for mouse brain Na channels and               one for mouse muscle.  The investigators propose to extend the                  screening of existing cDNA libraries to identify yet undiscovered               sequences.  In addition, mRNA specific probes will be derived from              the cDNA clones and used to characterize mRNA distribution in                   tissues during development and in cell cultures derived from brain              and muscle.  Finally, they will begin to prepare full length clones             for studies of function by expression.  The group in Marseille will             carry out RNA analysis.  At Washington University Dr. Merlie will               continue to screen for new cDNA clones, and to sequence the novel               clones that are identified.  Full length clones for expression will             be prepared and expressed in fibroblasts for pharmacological study              in Marseille.  Dr. Merlie has made significant contributions to the             field of sodium channel physiology and pharmacology.  Dr. Jovet and             his research group have extensive background in mouse development               systems.  The results of this project are expected to show how                  recombinant DNA and related techniques can be applied to the study              of ion channels.",
