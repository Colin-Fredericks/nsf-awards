 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brown University will purchase advanced, state-of-the-art workstations          to populate a unique classroom laboratory for computer science                  instruction.  This laboratory will use advanced software, now under             development, to provide a consistent visual programming environment to          undergraduates from their first, introductory programming course,               through the most advanced software engineering course or independent            study.  This environment will significantly improve the teaching of             computer science and will affect the whole undergraduate curriculum.                                                                                            The unique feature of the proposed environment is a set of integrated           tools for program and data structure visualization.  These tools will           enable students to visualize concepts and the programs that embody them         throughout their undergraduate experience.  A simple, \"read-only\"               version of the system BALSA, has been used at Brown successfully for            four years and has already had a significant impact on their                    curriculum.  The system envisioned, not only will provide more powerful         visualization tools, including color and real-time animation of three-          dimensional representations, but also will allow the student to                 interact with visualizations during the course of a lecture as well as          during the implementation of the student's own programs.",
