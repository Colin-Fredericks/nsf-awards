 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among physical interactions, gravitation plays a unique role               because it applies to all forms of matter and energy, it                        determines the structure of space and time, and it is believed to               be dominant at the very largest and very smallest physical                      scales.                                                                              At small scales gravity and quantum theory must be combined                consistently, a major unfinished goal of physics for many years.                Significant clues as to how this can occur may well be embodied                 in the thermal quantum radiance of black holes.  A major                        objective of this project is to exploit and deepen recently                     obtained new understanding of the statistical and quantum physics               associated with black hole radiance.                                                 Productive application of gravity theory to large scale                    systems, including unusual stars and star systems, and further                  advances in recent explorations seeking a quantum theory of                     gravity both depend strongly on an accurate implementation of a                 subset of Einstein's equations called the constraints.  The                     current understanding of the constraints will be applied in new                 ways to problems of both the above types.  One major application                will be calculation of possible initial configurations of two                   black holes as they begin an orbiting encounter.  Such collisions               are expected to produce gravity waves that should be detectable                 by experiments in the 1990's.",
