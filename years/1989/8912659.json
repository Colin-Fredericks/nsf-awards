 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent decades, uses of publicly collected data have expanded                greatly.  Data on individuals from censuses, sample surveys, and                administrative records are used increasingly by those who study                 employment, income, education, housing, crime, health, and other                issues relevant to national policy.  To a considerable degree,                  these uses have been made possible and encouraged by the data                   providers--the federal agencies that collect and disseminate the                data.  Key to the expansion of access has been the increasingly                 common practice of issuing public-use microdata files; that is,                 files containing individual data records with identifiers such as               name and address deleted.  The availability of such files permits               researchers to design statistical analyses to fit their analytic                interests and specific requirements.  The amount of detailed                    information that can be made available is, however, limited by                  the data providers' obligation to protect the confidentiality of                data.  Considerable confusion and misunderstanding, however,                    often arise in discussions of access and confidentiality because                of poorly developed and often idiosyncratic definitions of                      confidentiality, anonymity, privacy, and informed consent--all of               which tend to be confounded.                                                                                                                                    The Committee on National Statistics of the National Academy of                 Sciences and the Social Science Research Council are jointly                    convening a panel of experts to study these issues and to provide               a set of recommendations to federal agencies for better handling                issues relating to data access and confidentiality.  The purpose                of the panel is to advise the research community and providers of               data on how access may be improved with appropriate safeguards to               preserve confidentiality and without undue risk of adverse                      effects on public cooperation.  The scope of the investigation                  principally focuses on statistical data about people.  The panel                plans also to address confidentiality of data from business                     establishments and other legal entities, to the extent that                     similar questions are raised about such data.  Special workshops                will be convened on disclosure limitation techniques and informed               consent within a broader consideration of legal, ethical, and                   science policy issues.",
