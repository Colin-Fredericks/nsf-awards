 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to develop techniques for distinguishing                  cumulate from intercumulate components in rocks from the Beaver                 Bay gabbro complex, Minnesota, using backscatter SEM imaging,                   Normanski interference-contrast microscopy, and electron micro-                 probe traverse.  From this study the trapped intercumulus liquid                abundance (i.e., original porosity) will be estimated through                   summation of all intercumulate components, in a manner analogous                to original porosity estimates in sandstones.                                        A major study of major element, REE, and other trace element               variations in whole-rocks and in mineral separates is also                      proposed in order to examine the relationships between whole-rock               chemical composition and abundance and composition of the                       cumulate phases.  We also wish to understand the relationship                   between the variation in the amount of trapped liquid and the                   composition of the liquid, and to test whether the hypothesis                   involving a compositionally uniform trapped liquid in the Duluth                complex applies to Beaver Bay gabbro.                                                The relatively small size, excellent exposure, complete                    stratigraphic sequence, and extreme iron-enrichment differentia-                tion trend of the Beaver Bay gabbro make it well suited for the                 kind of study proposed here.  The data obtained from this study                 will also lead to the characterization of the parent magma                      composition(s), a description of the crystallization sequences in               the rocks, and an understanding of the processes to strong iron-                enrichment crystallization trends in the complex.",
