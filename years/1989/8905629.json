 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation of an                         Indian scientist, Dr. K.S. Khetwal of the Department of                         Chemistry, Kumaon University, Nainital, India, in a project                     managed by Dr. S. Pelletier at the University of Georgia,                       Athens, GA.  The research objective is to investigate the                       alkaloid constituents of certain Himalayan alkaloid-bearing                     species, including Aconitum balfourii Stapf (Ranunculaceae),                    A. laeve Royle, and A. violaceum Jacq.  The extracts of                         these species will be screened for their biological                             activities.  The funds will enable Dr. Khetwal to travel to                     Athens and work with Dr. Pelletier for approximately four                       months on the structural determination of active compounds                      using modern instrumentation including infrared, GC-MS                          spectra, proton and carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy.  Techniques                     such as specific homonuclear- heteronuclear decoupling,                         off-resonance techniques, broad band decoupling, NOE,                           relaxation experiments and 2D-methods will be utilized to                       provide further insight into the complex structures.                                                                                                            Scope:  The project is expected to increase understanding of                    the chemistry of Indian plants, especially those from the                       Himalayan region, to select pharmacologically interesting                       compounds that merit careful study, and to better understand                    the relationship between the chemical structure and the                         bioactivity.  The work will enhance the capability of the                       Indian scientist for carrying out useful Indo-U.S.                              collaboration when he returns to India.",
