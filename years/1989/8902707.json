 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conventional database management systems (DBMS's), in                           representing the state of an enterprise at a single point in                    time, do not provide support for storing or accessing                           time-varying data. In this project, the issues involved in the                  implementation of temporal DBMS's that provide such support                     are investigated. The adopted approach is the architectural                     refinement of a three-level store: one containing current data,                 one containing data concerning the past (and future), and one                   containing data that has been corrected. The impact of these                    refinements on all components of a temporal DBMS are to be                      studied, paying especially close attention to storage                           structures, concurrency control, and interaction between the                    main memory cache manager and the asynchronous archive manager.                 Simulation is used where possible, with a model built on an                     extensible DBMS when implementation experience and empirical                    data are desired.                                                                                                                                               The goal is to develop techniques that will add to conventional                 DBMS's the ability to efficiently perform operations involving                  time while not impacting the performance of conventional                        queries. This research will provide theoretical basis and                       understanding of temporal database system, as well as practical                 applications in areas beyond database community, e.g. software                  engineering as concepts developed may form the basis for                        programming environment, helping to manage versions or                          concurrency control.",
