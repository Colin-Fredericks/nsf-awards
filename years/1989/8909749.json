 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on identifying problem classes applicable to the           Application Oriented Paradigm, a new class of fault-tolerance design            method.  In this approach, the applications programmer is presented             with a Reliable Parallel Processing Model, which functionally consists          of an application level constraint predicate for constraining and               detecting faulty behavior, a configuration control layer for operation          in the presence of failed components, and a distributed diagnostic              basis.  The applications programmer must only be concerned with the             generation of an abstraction of each individual program's salient               reliability features.  This task is performed in concert with each              phase of the Software Life Cycle beginning with the specification               phase.  The methodology is applied to the design of parallel software           for massively parallel multicomputer networks, which can function in            the presence of both hardware and software errors.  Issues addressed            include system issues and configuration control, application                    applicability, automated constraint predicate generation, and fault             detection and recovery.                                                                                                                                         Fault tolerance is of paramount importance in large distributed                 multicomputers.  The design of a systematic method for developing               reliable control systems in massively parallel multicomputer networks           in the presence of both hardware and software error is very important.          This research develops a systematic method and demonstrates its                 applicability on applications in the design of massively parallel               systems.
