 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia cooperative                   research project between Dr. Samuel Buss of the University of                   California at San Diego and Dr. Jiri Becvar of the Czechoslavak                 Academy of Sciences Institute of Mathematics is to solve some                   closely related, central problems in mathematical logic involving               proof theory and complexity theory.  Specifically, joint efforts                will address: (1) fragments of Peano arithmetic, (2) fragments of               bounded arithmetic and (3) lengths of proofs in propositional and               in first-order logic.  Recent experience has shown that these                   topics overlap in content and technique.  It is expected that                   progress in one of the above topics will suggest new directions or              results for the others and thereby contribute to our basic knowledge            of the metamathematics of number theory.                                                                                                                        This project in mathematics research fulfills the program objective             of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United             States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool             research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
