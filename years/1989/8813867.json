 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor James A. Sauls of Northwestern                    University in a research collaboration with Professor Juhani                    Kurkijarvi of the Abo Academy, Abo, Finland.  They are carrying out a           theoretical study of the Josephson effect in superfluid helium-3,               with the goal of understanding the crossover from dissipative                   behavior to non-dissipative superflow in weak links.  Calculations              will be done of the Josephson current-phase relation and the maximum            critical current that can be supported by a weak link in superfluid             helium-3.  This work should provide a sufficiently realistic                    description of the superfluid to be a valuable guideline for the                design of experiments to measure the Josephson effect.  Both                    investigators have substantial experience in the quasiclassical                 theory of superconductivity and in numerical solutions of the                   quasiclassical equations.  Dr. Kurkijarvi has particular expertise in           the theory of superconducting Josephson devices, while Dr. Sauls is             an expert on the properties of superfluids.  As a team they have                outstanding qualifications for the proposed work, which should                  produce the theoretical basis needed to advance understanding of the            physics of quantum effects.                                                                                                                                     The discovery of superconductivity in the heavy fermion metals has              generated considerable interest from theorists and experimentalists             working in low temperature physics.  Quantitative calculations of the           properties of superconductors with strong spatial variations, e.g.,             weak links and tunnel junctions, are among the hardest theoretical              problems to solve in the field of superconductivity.  The                       quantitative calculations of the properties of weak links in                    superfluid helium-3 that will result from this collaborative research           should provide qualitative insights into weak links connecting                  unconventional superconductors and lead to more successful devices              based upon the Josephson effect.",
