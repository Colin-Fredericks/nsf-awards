These                       mostly descriptive findings show that American students                         perform comparatively poorly: in the eighth grade they are at                   an achievement level that is only average among all nations;                    by the twelfth grade, far below average. This research                          proposes to undertake an analysis of these educational                          outcomes.   This research will be using one of the sources of                   the much publicized findings -- the Second International                        Mathematics Study Data covering the mathematics interests and                   achievements of students from 32 countries, as well as                          measures of students' knowledge of material from the                            curriculum used by each teacher.   But this research begins                     by merging this data with information on the institutional                      characteristics of each nation's education system, e.g., data                   on how centralized is the control of curricula and teachers,                    the basis on which students are assigned to the next leveling                   of schooling, types of schools, sizes of schools and of                         classes in which sampled individuals are placed, per capita                     expenditures, characteristics of post-secondary education                       systems and their linkage with secondary education and other                    relevant national data including rates of female labor force                    participation.    As a result, the proposed analyses should                     provide a much improved understanding of the impact of the                      characteristics of national educational systems, as well as                     the characteristics of school, classroom and individual                         students on how well they learn mathematics.",
