 "awd_abstract_narration": "An implicit assumption in recent marine production research is that new         production can be quantitatively converted to net community production.         Applications of the new-regenerated model and net-gross model are               applied to critical questions such as how and to what extent ocean              biology affects material flux from surface waters.  This research is            currently limited by a non-quantitative understanding of how the models         relate to material flux or even how the models relate to each other.            This research is a field investigation of the relationship between net          and gross production (using both oxygen and Total Dissolved Inorganic           Carbon changes) and new and regenerated production (using 15N).  Both           mass balance and tracer rate measurements will be made on the same time         scale, using newly developed in situ samplers/incubators for                    simultaneous measurements.  The study focuses on testing the implicit           assumptions of balanced growth and balanced remineralization that relate        surface nutrient cycles.  The assumptions will be tested by comparing           the results of our unique incubations with the theoretical relationships        relating these cycles.  This direct analysis for short time scale               nutrient dynamics associated with plankton community metabolism will            lead to improved field methods for measuring material throughput in             planktonic systems.",
