(2) The High Desert Stream Ecology               Research Team will systematically sample water temperatures,                    species composition and diversity of fish, invertebrates and                    streamside vegetation in tributaries of the John Day River under                the direction of Dr. Hiram W. Li, fishery biologist, and Judy Li                and Dr. Gary Lamberti, aquatic entomologists.                                                                                                                   Both research teams will Hancock Field Station as a base of                     operations from July 10 until August 25, 1989.  Laboratories at                 Oregon State University and facilities of the Burke Museum of                   Natural History at the University of Washington will also be                    used.                                                                                                                                                           Activities will expose students to the methods, philosophy, and                 ethical issues relevant to paleontology, aquatic biology and                    related fields.  Participants from both teams will present a                    seminar for one another on their research.  Each participant will               conduct an independent project.",
