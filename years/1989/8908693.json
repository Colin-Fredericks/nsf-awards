 "awd_abstract_narration": "In real-time database systems, transaction processing must                      satisfy not only the database consistency constraints but also                  timing constraints such as deadlines. For the most part,                        database researchers have not dealt with timely issues while                    the real-time research community has ignored the problem of                     guaranteeing the consistency of shared data.                                                                                                                    This work involves the development of an integrated approach                    for supporting real-time transactions. The following topics                     will be investigated in depth: (1) Concurrency control                          protocols, (2) Recovery techniques, (3) Deadlock resolution                     strategies, and (4) CPU scheduling algorithms.  In addition, we                 will investigate two secondary issues: I/O scheduling and time                  constrained communication.  While we plan to employ simulations                 and analytical methods where appropriate, to a large extent,                    all our protocols and algorithms are to be implemented,                         evaluated and compared on an existing distributed database                      testbed called CARAT.  This is significant because CARAT has                    the ability to account for the (usually neglected, but not                      negligible) overheads involved in supporting distributed                        transactions.                                                                                                                                                   This research will have an impact on both the topics with which                 it overlaps, namely database systems and real-time systems.                     Also, because of the ubiquitous need for the timely processing                  of information in all applications that employ computers, such                  as in banking, command and control, automated factories, and                    process control systems, this project is expected to produce                    results that will positively affect many application areas as                   well.",
