 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall long term goal of this project is to understand the                 structure and function of cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP).  It is                 one of the more thoroughly studied heme enzymes and the X-ray                   structure of the native protein, as well as its reactive                        intermediate, compound I, are known at high resolution.  CCP                    offers an ideal system for the study of electron transport                      between hemeproteins and the activation of oxygen-oxygen bonds.                                                                                                 Many of the components contributing to electron transport and                   energy transduction processes are heme-containing enzymes,                      usually multi-component, complex membrane-bound assemblies which                are exceedingly difficult to study.  The advantage of CCP is its                relatively small size and ready crystallizability.  Although many               lines of investigation are made possible by the availbility of                  the combined techniques of site-directed mutagenesis and single                 crystal X-ray diffraction, Dr. Kraut's past work and that                       proposed now may be described as two separate but ultimately                    convergent experimental paths.***//",
