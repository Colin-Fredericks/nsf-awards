 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a cooperative pilot project on                              multiple-natural hazard mitigation between the US and Taiwan.                   The effort will be divided into four tasks.  Task I is to                       inventory information on available natural hazard reduction                     technologies and organizations responsible for natural hazards                  mitigation; design the data base format, and enter the                          information.  In Task II, a site in Taiwan will be selected as                  the demonstration locale and comprehensive data, e.g., nature of                natural hazards, historical records on frequency of occurrence,                 population at risk, building inventory, economic vulnerability,                 etc., will be compiled.  Similar information but in more general                terms will be collected for the US.  During Task III, the                       bilateral program will be designed taking into account the                      existing coping mechanisms for the most frequent hazards and                    integrating them with the measures taken for less frequent                      recurring natural disasters.  Three key areas will be addressed:                1) education and training of specifically identified audiences                  on strategies to minimize effects of natural disasters; 2) ways                 and means to implement available mitigation techniques, e.g.,                   building codes for new structures and upgrading for old ones;                   and 3) research needed for better dealing with multiple hazard                  vulnerability.  Task IV will consist of the evaluation of the                   preceding activities at a workshop, where findings and                          recommendations for multiple hazard reduction program                           implementation will be presented.  The US PI is Dr. George Lee,                 SUNY, Buffalo, and the Taiwan PI is Dr. Chao-Shiuan Liu,                        National Taiwan University.",
