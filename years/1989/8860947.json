 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymeric membranes are now used worldwide to perform                           energy-efficient, low-cost separation of liquid and gas process                 streams.  Design engineers routinely conside membrane-based unit                operations as viable alternatives to conventional separation                    technologies.  However, the inability of polymeric membranes to                 withstand high-temperatures or chemically harsh environments deprives           many industries of the key advantages of membrane technology.                   Currently available polymeric membranes are now used in some of these           harsh settings, but their characteristic cost- and energy-efficiencies          are offset by the need for expensive pretreatment of chemically                 destructive process streams or by                                               the need to drastically cool hot feed streams.  For most processes,             such pretreatment is impractical or altogether impossible.  Moreover,           non-polymeric membranes (e.g. ceramic) currently available are too              expensive, difficult to modularize, and/or prone to irreversible                fouling.  This project will investigate the feasibility of using a              group of robust polymers to prepare membranes capable of withstanding           up to 300 degrees centigrade in chemically challenging operations.  In          Phase I of the project, appropriate polymers will be evaluated and              screened for diffusion properties to various gases and liquids. One or          more will be selected for further study in Phase II, where membranes            based on these polymers will be developed and                                   optimized.

In Phase I of                 the project, appropriate polymers will be evaluated and screened                for their potential to separate gas or liquid molecules from one                another if a membrane based on the polymer were to be developed.                One or more will be selected for further study in Phase II, where               the actual membranes based on these polymers will be developed                  and optimized.",
