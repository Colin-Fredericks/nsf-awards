 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has incorporated a kinetics experiment using                  fast UV-Visible spectrophotometry into the established project-                 based laboratory program.  This laboratory program is based on                  the premise that education in chemistry is appropriately                        augmented by realistic laboratory experiences that are designed                 to produce attitudes of resourcefulness and independence through                a four year series of stand-alone projects.  In the Analytical-                 Organic Lab, the projects require students to make measurements                 and determinations using modern microcomputer controlled                        instruments as well a s to learn classical organic experimental                 techniques.  This project connects the analytical and organic                   aspects by employing fast UV-VIS spectrometers in the measurement               of reaction rates and then analyze a reaction mechanism and                     related structure with reactivity by using these rates.  The                    institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of                   funds.",
