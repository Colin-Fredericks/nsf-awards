 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the University of Oklahoma (OU) in                           collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric                         Administration (NOAA) requests funds to establish a Science and                 Technology Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms.  The                   Director of the Center will be Professor Douglas K. Lilly.                                                                                                      A new generation of models must be developed to address the                     storm-scale prediction problem and there is currently no critical               mass of scientists anywhere in the U.S. to carry out this                       research.  The Center will fill this gap and will serve as a                    focal point for other researchers interested in this area.                      Complementary modelling work is being carried out at the National               Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and other universities,                  but the models used in these related research efforts do not                    provide adequate frameworks for the multi-scale tasks required in               the OU Center.  The Center plans to enhance their working                       relationships with NCAR and other university researchers,                       especially through exchange of faculty, staff, and students.                                                                                                    The initial research will proceed in three directions: model                    development; predictability research and sensitivity testing; and               data assimilation and initialization research.  The scope of the                problems being addressed spans basic theory, experimentation, and               operational testing.  The success of such models will necessarily               require the use of advanced numerical techniques not previously                 applied to atmospheric modelling; many will force a complete                    change in the framework of existing models.  In addition, the                   assimilation/initialization problem will require a different                    theoretical framework than has been heretofore used.  Finally, by               developing a new model, full advantage can be taken of rapidly                  evolving computer architectures, particularly the large memory                  and highly parallel supercomputers.                                                                                                                             The research couples the multidisciplinary expertise at OU.  The                governing physics of many phenomena, e.g., cloud dynamics and                   surface energy balance, must be investigated and modelled.  The                 model must then be incorporated into a general mesoscale                        predictive capability, using numerical procedures which                         accurately simulate the flows involved.  With the methods                       envisioned, the computer is allowed as an \"expert system\" to                    alter its numerical algorithm and its spatial and temporal                      resolution, in response to observable changes in the fields.  All               of these must be tested using the inputs from real data, and the                initialization and assimilation of these data are the linchpins                 of the process, allowing the predictive capability of the                       simulation to be tested and evaluated against measured                          atmospheric processes.",
