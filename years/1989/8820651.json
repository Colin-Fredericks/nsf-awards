 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the work of                         Dr.Donald Burton.  Burton, a professor of chemistry at the                      University of Iowa, is investigating new methods for preparing                  fluorine-containing organic molecules.  The replacement of a                    C-H bond with a C-F bond dramatically alters the physical,                      chemical and biological properties of a molecule.  The methods                  for carrying out these replacements have often required                         specialized equipment, reagents and facilities.  Prof. Burton                   has pioneered, and continues to develop, techniques and                         reagents that make these replacements accessible to research                    workers without these specialized facilities.  Prof. Burton's                   research focuses on the development of new reagents, new                        procedures, and a mechanistic understanding of basic chemical                   principles that govern these reactions.                                                                                                                         The program will generally develop new approaches to                            fluorine-containing ylide intermediates and stable fluorinated                  organometallic reagents.  Specific studies include new                          approaches to fluoroolefins via ylide intermediates,                            development of trifluoromethyl copper reagents that can be                      applied to novel difluoromethylene grafting and fluorocarbon                    chain homologation protocols, development of fluorinated                        allene, diene, vinyl and acetylenic reagents, and the general                   development of new methods for preparing fluorinated                            heterocyclic molecules.",
