 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is designed around the central theme \"the                          history and development of the earth.\"  During the Summer                       Institutes and other activities which make up the program the                   links between the various aspects of earth science will be                      emphasized.                                                                                                                                                     Peer teaching, a balance of activities, and a good multiplier                   effect characterize these Summer Institutes.  The earth                         science content areas to be studied are astronomy, geology,                     oceanography, and meteorology.  Following morning lectures                      with practical demonstrations and hands-on activities where                     appropriate, the afternoon laboratory projects designed by                      the faculty, will aid participants in understanding the                         course material and provide models which can be used by the                     teachers in their own classes.  This laboratory time also                       provides an opportunity for \"sharing\" of activities between                     participants and for small group interaction with faculty.                      Field experiences (25% of the program) to provide hands-on                      experience will be scheduled after studying the relevant                        subject matter component.  The balance is good being                            approximately (40% lectures, 35% laboratory, 25% field                          trips).                                                                                                                                                         Thirty \"original participants\" will attend a four-week                          Institute at the University of Texas - San Antonio (UTSA).                      Then each of these will co-present, with four other                             participants and a lead teacher, a workshop based on the                        materials developed during the Summer Institute.  Each of                       these workshops will enroll 30 - teachers at \"cluster                           centers\" around the San Antonio area.  They will be conducted                   in the following academic year.  This is peer teaching with a                   6 to 1 multiplier effect.                                                                                                                                       Also, follow-up meetings will be held during the following                      academic year.  At these meetings the 30 original                               participants each accompanied by another teacher who attended                   a cluster workshop, will report on the pedagogical                              application of the ideas gained during the course.                                                                                                              Workshop participants will come from public and private                         middle schools of Region 20 - Education Service Center around                   San Antonio.  With this mix of participants and activities,                     participating teachers will assume significant ownership of                     the materials developed which will be key to their continued                    use and improvement of earth science education in the San                       Antonio area.                                                                                                                                                   I recommend a standard award for 12 months of $130,247.  The                    University of Texas - San Antonio is cost sharing an amount                     of $18,200 or approximately 14%.                                                                                                                                TPE-8850984                                                 2                                                                                                   If child care is allowed the recommendation is for a standard                   award of $143,747 for 12 months.  The cost sharing of $18,200                   represents 13%.//",
