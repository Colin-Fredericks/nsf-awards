 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Intelligent structures\" are designed to self monitor their ability to          perform designed tasks.  To provide this \"intelligence\" a nerve system          must be embedded in the structure.  Optical fiber strain sensors have           repeatedly been touted as prime candidates for this nervous system,             particularly when the structure is produced from fiber reinforced               composite materials.  Recent results indicate that the nervous system           is not an uncoupled observer and that it may cause severe degradation           of the structural component which they monitor.  The amount of fiber-           host material interaction is a critical, but overlooked, aspect of the          fast emerging smart structures technology.  The fiber-host material             interaction is to be studied on three fronts.  A high frequency moire'          interferometry technique is proposed to study the surface strains in            the fiber-host material interaction zone.  Calculations indicate that           this image processing based technique can increase the resolution of            moire' interferometry as much as 800 fold.  Optical fiber sensor                technology will be advanced so that meaningful internal strain                  information can be obtained from embedded single mode optical fibers.           Three dimensional finite element analysis will be used to design                experiments and to supplement experimental results.  The above                  information will be used both to quantify fiber-host material                   interaction mechanisms and to predict the effect these mechanisms have          on the life cycle of a structural component containing an embedded              optical fiber nervous system.  The optical fiber-host material                  interaction mechanisms must be resolved before an overwhelming                  commitment to a structurally embedded optical fiber nervous system can          be made.",
