 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is intended to integrate the design and manufacturing functions              together so that problems inherent in increasing productivity can be            solved effectively and efficiently.  Equipment is needed to train               undergraduates students in modern technology such as CAD/CAM and CNC            (Computer Numerical Controlled) machining.                                      Ten CAD/CAM workstations together with associated CAD software                  packages are in the process of being acquired.  A turning center will           be acquired and interfaced to CAD/CAM stations to form a truly                  integrated CAD/CAM manufacturing cell.  In an integrated three course           environment, the students will be introduced to CAD and CNC.  Senior            students will receive hands-on experience in design with CAD systems            and then will transfer their design to the turning center for CNC               machining.",
