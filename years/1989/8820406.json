 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neural plasticity refers to the ability of central nervous                 system connections to be modified or rearranged, particularly                   during a critical period early in development.  The overall goal                of Dr. Stryker's research over the past several years has been to               understand the role of neural activity in mammalian visual system               plasticity and development.                                                                                                                                          Much recent evidence from studies of long-term potentiation                (LTP) in the hippocampus suggests that the N-methyl-D-aspartate                 (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor plays a crucial role in this               neural activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.  LTP plasticity is               found in both young and adult nervous systems.  In this project,                Dr. Stryker and his colleagues will conduct several studies to                  elucidate the role of NMDA receptors in mediating the effects of                activity on the plasticity of the cat visual cortex.  Plasticity                in the visual cortex is only found during an early stage of                     development. The investigators will infuse NMDA-antagonists into                the visual cortex; measure electrophysiologically the specificity               of the receptor blockade so produced; record the effects of NMDA-               receptor blockade on patterns of neural activity; and study                     physiologically and anatomically effects on plasticity in                       development.                                                                                                                                                         Dr. Stryker has a long history of making significant                       contributions to our knowledge of nervous system development.                   This new work promises to reveal whether the cellular and                       molecular details of plasticity in the adult central nervous                    system (LTP), now receiving enormous research attention, apply                  also to the rearrangement of neuronal connections in brain                      development.",
