 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Engineering Research Center for Compound Semiconductor                 Microelectronics has the goal of developing new concepts,                       materials, devices and systems that would contribute to the                     elimination of the interconnection bottlenecks that are limiting                the performance of high speed digital systems.  The demands for                 increasing the performance of the interconnects and the                         development of efficient very low threshold semiconductor lasers                and hi-speed GaAs based electronics combine to make the                         examination of optical interconnects for digital integrated                     circuits very promising.  To fully utilize optical interconnects                it will be necessary to combine high performance optical and                    electrical heterostructure devices in integrated devices.                            The vision of the ERC is to develop the engineering science                base which will be needed to realize products based on compound                 semiconductor optoelectronic chips.  Research of this type spans                a wide range of topics--from fundamental studies on growth of the               semiconductor materials, to device physics, device design, chip-                level system simulation and test.  The Research Program at the                  Illinois ERC has four thrusts which together should have a                      significant impact on the development of optoelectronic                         integrated circuits (OEIC).  These research thrusts are optical                 waveguides; optical transmitters; optical receivers; systems                    design and support services.  The ERC has been actively involved                in impurity induced disordering which it has exploited for laser                structures and for guiding light around bends.  A SPICE-like                    simulator for optoelectronic circuits (iSMILE) has been developed               along with a laser CAD tool called MINILASE.  These simulation                  tools will help in the design of OEIC's and eliminate the need                  for actually fabricating some experimental circuits.                                 The center emphasizes educational activities to develop                    engineering capability in this field.",
