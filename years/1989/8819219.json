 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific aims of this proposal are directed toward a                        molecular characterization of the stunted (stuA) gene, a                        modifier of conidiophore development in Aspergillus nidulans. The               stunted gene is a member of a group of potential regulatory genes               that are arranged in a hierarchical order and that control normal               development during conidiation. Mutations in this gene have a                   profound affect upon conidiophore structure, a result of aberrant               progression though the normal developmental program. Molecular                  genetic techniques will be used to clone and physically                         characterize the stunted gene in order to begin an investigation                of the gene product's biochemical function; to elucidate the                    temporal expression of this gene during development in the wild                 type strain and in other developmental mutants; to investigate                  the affects of experimentally altered stunted gene expression                   upon conidiophore development and to isolate novel stuA alleles.                Double mutants will be generated for the purpose of investigating               potential interactions, at the molecular level, of genes                        responsible for normal asexual reproduction and to relate these                 interactions to structure formation.                                            %%%                                                                             A fundamental problem in biology is the elucidation of molecular                mechanisms that mediate cell differentiation and the organization               of cell types during morphogenesis.  The filamentous fungi are an               important group of organisms that have been extremely useful for                studies that address development in eucaryotes. Although many of                these fungi are propagated by asexually produced and aerially                   dispersed conidia (spores), very little is known about the                      biochemical and genetic mechanisms that mediate coordinately                    regulated gene expression and cellular differentiation during                   asexual reproduction.",
