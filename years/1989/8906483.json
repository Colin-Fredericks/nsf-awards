 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of this project is to develop a systematic understanding of the          theory and practice of highly concurrent data objects.  The need for            such an understanding has become compelling as technological advances           have made multiprocessor machines readily available.  Despite                   impressive progress at the hardware level, there is little agreement on         the relative merits of competing architectures, and it has often proved         difficult to realize these machines' potential for parallelism.  These          difficulties are compounded when application requirements include               fault-tolerance or real-time performance.  The PI's prior work had made         significant contributions to the theory of highly concurrent data               structures by exploiting the theory of abstract data types to derive            (1) impossibility results, showing that certain kinds of concurrency            simply cannot be achieved with certain primitives; (2) new techniques           for specifying and reasoning about the behavior of concurrent objects,          and (3) synchronization algorithms permitting high degrees of                   concurrency never before achieved.  The resulting theory has a rich             mathematical structure, yielding a number of unexpected results with            consequences for algorithm design, implications of these results are            poorly understood.  A principal objective of this project is to                 undertake experimental work to translate theoretical results into               practice.",
