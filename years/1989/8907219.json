 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds to develop a 3D Reconstruction Center                 in the School of Science and the School of Medicine at Indiana                  University-Purdue University at Indianapolis.  This facility will               serve three primary functions: 1) support and extend several on-                going research projects in the Department of Biology and Anatomy,               2) provide the computer tools through which interaction among                   faculty will be enhanced, and 3) allow the researchers in                       Indianapolis to participate in the developing and testing of 3D                 reconstruction software with their colleagues at the University                 of Washington in Seattle.                                                                                                                                       Many investigations in the life sciences would benefit from the                 ability to create three dimensional models of their objects of                  study.  These models are necessary for the understanding of the                 interrelationships among the parts which comprise the whole.  The               mathematics of applied geometry are well-known, but are                         computational intensive.  The latest generation of microcomputers               have become powerful enough to handle such computational                        problems.  Our group is seeking the computer hardware, software,                and necessary peripherals to record images of serial sections,                  enter those images into the computer, process the 2 dimensional                 images into 3 dimensional models that can be manipulated,                       dissected, explored and copied onto paper and slides.                                                                                                           The benefits of funding this project are in an increase in                      productivity of a wide variety of investigations, enhanced                      understanding by other investigators through better presentation                of research findings and cooperation in development of new                      algorithms to provides more powerful software for the life                      sciences.",
