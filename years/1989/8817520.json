 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is intended to elucidate the mechanism by which                   force is developed by the interaction of myosin and actin                       molecules in muscle (and in a number of other motile systems)                   and will focus on the dynamics of the changes taking place in                   the crossbridges in striated muscle during contraction.  It                     has long been established that muscle contraction is brought                    about by a sliding filament mechanism, in which partially                       overlapping arrays of actin and myosin filaments are acted on                   by a relative sliding force which leads to shortening of the                    muscle.  It is generally believed that this force is                            generated by a cyclic interaction of myosin crossbridges with                   sites on the actin filaments.  However, the structural                          details of the process have proved to be particularly                           difficult to establish, partly because of the transient and                     unsynchronized nature of many of the changes taking place,                      and partly because of the technical difficulty of obtaining                     submicroscopic structural information about any rapidly                         changing biological system.  The development of rapid                           freezing techniques by Heuser and  others has now made it                       possible in principle to obtain electron microscope images of                   these transient structural states and suitable variations of                    these techniques will be developed to enable correlations to                    be made with evidence derived from time-resolved x-ray                          diffraction studies.                                                                                                                                            These approaches should provide important new information                       about the structural behavior of the crossbridges as they                       interact with actin and develop force.  When combined with                      new information from biochemical and physiological studies,                     the results of the present work should materially advance our                   understanding of this very fundamental biological mechanism.",
