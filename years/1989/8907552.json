 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Loew is theoretically characterizing the relationship                  between structure, spectra, and function of heme proteins.  The                 work is focused primarily on one class of metabolizing heme                     enzymes, the peroxidase, in comparison with other classes of heme               proteins to understand the origin of their functional                           differences. Four complementary sets of studies are envisioned                  which utilize increasingly complex models for the heme active                   site.                                                                           1.  Continued studies using the least complex, iron-porphine,                   heme model for the active site will focus on three types of                     calculations.  In one study, the electronic spectra of complexes                of Metmyglobin (MetMb) with small anionic ligands will be                       calculated.  In another, a comparative study will be made of the                resting state and putative transient peroxide complex of                        Cytochrome C Peroxidase (CCP) to help to further identify this                  species.  In the third study, the spectra of the biologically                   active Compound-I forms of peroxidases and catalase will be                     calculated in an attempt to further understand the origin of the                observed differences between them.                                              2.  At the next level of model heme active sites, studies will be               made of the effect of porphyrin ring substituents on the                        ground-state properties of CCP and related peroxidases.                         3.  Since the heme unit alone does not determine the function of                different heme proteins, an expanded active site including amino                acids near the proximal histidine ligand and the distal binding                 site will be used to (a) compare of the ease of formation of the                biologically active Compound-I form of CCP to that in MetMb,                    which should help understand why two such similar proteins have                 different biological functions and (b) further elucidate the                    electron transfer mechanism from nearby candidate amino acids to                the heme unit of CCP-I and identification of this still                         controversial radical center.                                                   4.  Full protein studies are also planned to address the effect                 of conformational and dynamic behavior on the function of the                   peroxidases, focusing on the amino acids thought to be involved                 in Compound-I formation and in the transfer of an electron to its               heme unit.  Dr. Loew will also try to understand why some site                  specific mutations destroy peroxidase activity, while others                    retain it, and the effect of mutation on the electron transfer                  process.  The refined crystal structure of CCP will also be used                to attempt to construct a primitive structure of horseradish                    peroxidase, with the goal of obtaining a three dimensional                      description of the key amino acids near the heme unit, where the                greatest homology with CCP exists.                                                   If successful, three specific questions of current interest                will be addressed.  (1) Is the mechanism of formation of                        Compound-I in HRP similar to that in CCP?  (2) Where is the                     substrate binding site in HRP?  (3) Why is there no electron                    transfer from the protein to the heme unit in HRP-I, as there                   appears to be in CCP-I?",
