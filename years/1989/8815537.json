 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative studies between Dr. Gerald                Edelman and his research group at the Neurosciences Institute,                  Rockefeller University and Dr. Francois Rieger, Unite de Recherche              de Biologie et Pathologie Neuromusculaires, Centre National de la               Recherche Scientifique, Paris, France.  Dr. Edelman, a Nobel Prize              winner and eminent researcher in the proposed topic, has                        collaborated successfully with Dr. Rieger in the past.                                                                                                          The neuromuscular system is a complex supracellular structure                   composed of a number of different cell types:  sensory and motor                neurons, Schwann cells, muscle cells, fibroblasts, and various                  support cells.  The development, maintenance, and physiological                 functions of the neuromuscular system depend upon specialized                   structures, including the neuromuscular junction, the myotendinous              junction, and the nodes of Ranvier.  In previous research Drs.                  Edelman and Rieger showed that three glycoproteins involved in                  cell-cell adhesion are localized to these privileged sites and                  vary in amount and distribution during development and regeneration             of neuromuscular contacts:  the neural cell adhesion molecule,                  N-CAM, the neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule,  Ng-CAM, and                     cytotactin, an extracellular matrix protein.  The localization of               these molecules was altered in mutant animals with various cellular             defects and antibodies to N-CAM blocked the appropriate                         reinnervation patterns after injury, inhibiting reformation of                  synapses at old synaptic sites and allowing for extrasynaptic                   nerve-muscle contacts.  The patterns of expression of these                     molecules correlate with those of other neuromuscular proteins,                 including acetylcholinesterase, and voltage-dependent calcium                   channels.  During the next phase of collaboration, the                          investigators will examine the detailed basis for the localized                 pattern of expression of adhesion molecules and neuromuscular                   proteins, focusing particularly on cytoskeletal interactions.  They             will also use cDNA clones specific for muscle forms of N-CAM to                 transfect cells and produce transgenic animals.  These joint                    experiments would be difficult to accomplish in either laboratory               alone.  The expertise of Dr. Rieger and his colleagues in electron              microscopy, neurophysiology and mutant strains of mice will                     complement the expertise of Dr. Edelman and his group in the                    isolation and characterization of cell adhesion molecules,                      molecular biological techniques, fluorescence microscopy and the                production and screening of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.               These studies should provide new insights into the formation and                maintenance of structures crucial to muscle function, as well as to             their aberrations in muscle disease and dysfunction.",
