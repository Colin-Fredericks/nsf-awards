 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infants that are involuntarily separated from their mothers may                 suffer severe physiological and behavioral consequences.  Most of               what we know concerning the physiological effects has derived                   from studies using nonhuman primates.  These effects include                    increases in sympathetic activity, changes in neurotransmitter                  levels, and increased activity of the pituitary-adrenal system, a               neuroendocrine system associated with stress.   For many years,                 it was only possible to study such questions in primates since                  common laboratory rodents have been thought to respond to                       separation in a fundamentally different way than do primates, and               possibly humans.  With his previous NSF support, Dr. Hennessy                   demonstrated that the responses of young guinea pigs to maternal                separation are in many ways similar to those of primates.  The                  guinea pig model provides an alternative to primate research                    which, in turn, offers many practical advantages.  Dr. Hennessy                 would continue his research to further our understanding of how                 brief periods of maternal separation alter neuroendocrine and                   behavioral functioning.  These studies will contribute to our                   understanding of the consequences of mother-infant separation and               processes of attachment and elucidate the nature of the stress                  response in young.",
