 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will utilize various analytical and theoretical                    methods to better understand the origin of eclogite inclusions in               kimberlites of southern Africa.  The first objective is to                      characterize the major and trace element and stable and                         radiogenic isotopic relationships among primary phases.  The P.I.               will complete and publish the results of a preliminary study on a               chemically diverse suite of samples, including data on major and                trace elements, and oxygen and Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr isotopes.  To do                 this he will require additional oxygen isotopic data on coesite                 and Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr data on garnet.  In addition to completion of               the preliminary study, he will undertake crystal chemical                       modeling of major and trace element and oxygen isotope                          fractionation in these rocks, based on compressibility                          measurements and additional structure refinements at room                       temperature and elevated temperature.  A second objective is to                 characterize the major and trace-element chemistry of the                       secondary phases that have formed in small veins and grain                      boundaries in these samples, and appear to be the result of                     metasomatism at depth.  This will be done by electron microprobe                together with analytical SEM and TEM micropetrography of these                  phases which appear to be chemically related to the host                        eclogite.  These studies should better define the causes of                     eclogite compositional variation which will yield a greater                     understanding of the chemical dynamics of the upper mantle.                     Funding of this proposal at a level reduced from the originally                 requested $123,603 will result in fewer analyses and reduced                    usage of the analytical TEM, which is the most expensive of the                 analytical techniques.  We also will be unable to support a full-               time graduate student in this study, although we do anticipate                  having student support from other sources which may be partly                   applied to this project.  Also, support for T. McCormick is                     slightly reduced from 25% to 20% of full-time.  The attached                    revised  budget at approximately $78,400 over two years reflects                these changes.  At the funding level of the attached revised                    budget, we anticipate significant progress in understanding the                 chemical dynamics of the upper mantle over the next two years.",
