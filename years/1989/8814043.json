 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference, entitled \"Bicarbonate, Chloride, and Proton                    Transport System\" is an international basic science conference                  sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences.  The conference is               focused on the roles of the movement of bicarbonate, chloride and               hydrogen ions across and into cells in controlling cell acidity,                volume and organ function and the manner by which these movements               occur in animal and plant systems.  The biophysics, physiology                  and molecular biology involved in these processes will be                       presented and discussed. The importance of these processes in                   maintaining acid and electrolyte homeostasis has been                           increasingly recognized, and this timely conference will provide                a unique opportunity for the gathering of investigators who are                 working in diverse systems to exchange and present their work to                one another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The recognition by animal physiologists of the general importance               of anion transport processes is relatively recent compared to                   that of cations transport. This situation in part arises from the               fact that cation transport was first found to be important in                   neural transmission, and because cations are technically more                   easily studied. As a result anion and proton transport were                     generally considered to occur secondarily to that of cation                     movement.  Recent discoveries have emphasized the importance of                 anion transport as exemplified by the involvement of                            C1-conductive channels in cystic fibrosis, as well as ocular and                gastro-intestinal tissues.  Also in recent years, the involvement               of C1-HCO3 exchange in the overall processes of gastric and renal               acid excretion has received new attention, as well as the role of               anion transport in cell volume regulation.  Research in the area                of anion and proton transport has also recently branched into the               structural and molecular aspects of the transmembrane movement of               these ions and several important advancements have been made in                 the 10 years.  The intent of this conference is to provide a                    forum for researchers in the transmembrane, structural, enzymatic               and transepithelial areas of anion and proton transport in both                 animals and plants.  A previous conference on this subject in                   1979 was successful and well attended, and we believe that in the               past ten years, sufficient advances both in the technical and                   scientific areas have been made to warrant the presently proposed               conference.",
