 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John Horowitz is continuing a line of experimentation                  which is designed to understand the neural activity underlying                  hibernation.  He is studying the hippocampus because it is a                    region of the brain that appears to be involved in the entrance                 into and arousal from hibernation.  By using the hippocampal                    slice preparation, the temperature of the bathing solution over                 the hippocampal neural network can be easily precisely set to                   match any temperature in the range observed in the CNS of animals               entering hibernation.  One set of experiments centers on the                    effect of temperature on long-term potentiation (LTP).  LTP has                 captured the imagination of neuroscientists as a model with which               to probe the mechanisms of learning and memory in the mammalian                 brain, but whether these mechanisms persist at low brain                        temperatures is unknown.  Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, has been               shown to play a role in an animal's entrance into hibernation.                  Therefore, the second set of experiments if to determine the                    effect of temperature on the serotonergic response of hippocampal               neurons.  This work is important because it will give us more                   insight into how the brain regulates and operates during low                    temperature states.",
