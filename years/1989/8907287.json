 "awd_abstract_narration": "Historical data and observations from studies of the coastal Antarctic          Peninsula region provide detailed documentation of massive phytoplankton        blooms which develop within the Gerlache Strait and the southwest               portion of the Bransfield Strait.  Hydrographic data indicate that the          flow field is relatively quiescent in the region of bloom formation.            The objectives of the proposed work are to understand the temporal              detail regarding the mechanisms leading to formation and decline of             these blooms.                                                                                                                                                   This component of the RACER (Research on Antarctic Coastal Ecosystem            Rates) program will utilize an interdisciplinary approach to resolve the        phytoplankton response to physical forcing.  The emphasis will be on            high temporal resolution of meteorological forcing of turbulent mixing          within the upper water column, and the response of the phytoplankton.           This will be accomplished with a permanent meteorological station on an         island adjacent to the primary station and rapid profiling of physical-         optical-biological properties. Detailed studies of phytoplankton rate           processes including carbon and nitrogen isotope uptake studies, growth          rates determined by radio-carbon labelling of chlorophyll a, and                kinetics of photoadaptation will be carried out.  The photoadaptive             status of the phytoplankton crop will be determined from optical,               biochemical, and photosynthetic parameters.                                                                                                                     This information is essential for an understanding of the underlying            mechanisms of bloom formation.  Such an understanding is required for           development of mechanistic models which are capable of predicting               seasonal progression and interannual variability forced by the physical         environment.",
