 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is concerned with the analysis and development of a class of          robust adaptive filtering algorithms which are capable of operating             effectively in an environment of impulsive noise.  Adaptive signal              processing and particularly adaptive filtering involving linear filters         provides a powerful approach to many signal processing problems.  The           capacity of adaptive algorithms to operate when limited a priori                information is available makes them ideally matched to many practical           applications.  The performance of linear adaptive filters is, however,          severely degraded when impulsive noise is present in the filter inputs.         Such impulsive interference occurs frequently in many applications.             The work here is concerned with the development of a class of nonlinear         adaptive filters which are insensitive to the presence of such                  interference.  This is achieved through a proposed Median Least-Mean-           Squares (MLMS) algorithm.  This algorithm operates by replacing the             instantaneous estimate of the gradient of the mean-squared error                performance surface (as used by the well-known LMS adaptive filter) by          the sample median of that quantity.                                                                                                                             In this work, the feasibility of the MLMS is established and a theory           for the MLMS, both for random and deterministic inputs, is developed.           A general class of robust adaptive filtering procedures based on order          statistics (of which the MLMS is a single member) is developed.  The            properties of key order statistical adaptive filters including the kth          rank and trimmed mean are established, and algorithms designed to               facilitate adaptation to optimize the order statistical filter in               relation to the statistics of the input are developed.",
