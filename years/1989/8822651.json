This equipment is                     maintained for use on or in association with the R/V POINT SUR, a               research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by the University.                A substantial part of the ship's operating schedule during 1989                 is in support of NSF.sponsored research projects. The                           instrumentation will also increase the capabilities includes:                                                                                                   .Acoustic transceiver for determineining the precise depth under                the ship and for measuring seafloor characteristics,                            .SAIL data logging modules for increasing the number of                         environmental parameters that are routinely monitored,                          .Navigational information distribution system for the remote                    read.out of precision navigation data at several locations,                     .Deck controller for the expendable bathythermograph system,                    .De.ionized water filter system for making reagent quality water                for a variety of shipboard experiments.
