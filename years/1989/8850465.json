 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Labnet project is to establish student research                 projects as an important and accepted part of science                           instruction throughout the United States by enhancing science                   teachers' ability to involve students in science                                investigations.  To this end, the project will facilitate                       project laboratories and the establishment of a                                 telecommunications network.  The labs can be offered as either                  full courses or as components of existing high school science                   courses.                                                                                                                                                        The three year project takes full advantage of microcomputer-                   based labs (MBL) and telecommmunications technologies.  TERC,                   Tufts University and Dickinson College will join forces to                      offer workshops to 120 teachers of secondary school science (in                 teams of four/school) and to 180 teacher-trainers who will                      function as disseminators and outreach leaders for this                         project.  The teachers will be involved in four weeks of                        workshop activity including content and computer use, three                     during the first summer and one in the second summer with                       intervening meetings and staff observations during the school                   year.  The \"trainers\" will be working for a total of three                      weeks during one summer.  Some of these \"trainers\" by virtue of                 their own background and expertise may participate in a two-                    week session. Each \"trainer\" will be charged with running                       workshops for at least 30 other teachers using the first group                  of teachers as role models and as an additional resource for                    their peers.  The project predicts that many teachers across                    the country will be impacted by this project and thus a                         significant fraction of all high school students will have                      access to project laboratory experiences during their secondary                 education.                                                                                                                                                      The project is based on already developed units (through a                      previously funded project) dealing with acid rain, seismic                      activity, weather and radiation with the option of developing                   units around other already existing MBL activities in                           chemistry, biology, physics and earth science. This MBL                         approach to laboratory investigations has proven to be                          effective to every population group from the gifted and                         talented to special needs students.                                                                                                                             Once started on a national scale, the project will be able to                   continue without future funding because it has strong private-                  sector support and will create interest among research                          scientists and engineers as well as educators through its long-                 term student data-collection and potential environmental                        monitoring networks. Acknowledging that it could take a long                    time to implement a nation-wide network of students and                         teachers engaged in research issues, TERC has committed itself                  to long-term involvement with this project. An amount                           equivalent to 20% of the NSF request for funding has been                       obtained from outside sources, including TERC, IBM, McGraw-                     Hill, Tufts University and Dickinson College as well as                         contributions from school districts.",
