 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the University of Oregon requests funds                      to enhance the planning of a Science and Technology Research                    Center in Soft X-Ray Science.  This multiinstitutional and                      multidisciplinary center will include participants with expertise               in physical, chemical, material, and biological sciences.  The                  Center's scientific focus will be on the microscopic                            characterization of heterogeneous systems.  The Center proposes                 to use bright new sources of synchrotron radiation in the soft                  x-ray range to open new fields of research or to expand existing                ones to allow qualitatively different types of phenomena in                     heterogeneous systems to be studied.  Fields tentatively included               are:  spectroscopy and microscopy, soft x-ray fluorescence, and                 time-resolved spectroscopy.  These funds will enable the                        institution to complete assimilation of a group of qualified                    personnel, identify the most important scientific issues, plan                  the administrative and scientific structure of the Center, and                  determine which instrumentation will best serve the needs of the                Center.                                                                                                                                                         The proposed center, which will be at the frontier of a large and               expanding interdisciplinary field of research, will also serve                  users from universities, industry, and international                            laboratories.  The goal of the Center is to make a major                        contribution in the area of soft x-ray science.",
