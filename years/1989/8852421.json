 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project describes biomaterials testing as a laboratory                     experience.  This laboratory would be taught in conjunction with a              course in biomaterials science and engineering which is currently               given as a lecture with no associated lab.  Experiments using the               proposed materials testing equipment include static tension and                 compression tests, tests of viscoelastic properties including                   stress relaxation and dynamic (oscillatory) tests, and fatigue                  testing.  Biomaterials tested will be biological as well as                     man-made implant materials.  Thus materials tested will range from              tendon and bone specimens to implantable polymers, ceramics,                    metals and composites.  The equipment specified is adequate and                 necessary to perform the above testing.  Theory of the above tests              and models for mechanical behavior of materials are discussed in                the lecture portion of course, thus student will get practical                  experience as well as see application of theory in performing the               laboratory experiments.  Formal lab reports will be written by                  students and typed, preferably on department-supplied work                      processing software and PC's.  PC-based data acquisition and                    real-time monitor display of signals from the equipment are                     supplied.  Readily available floppy disk data storage and                       subsequent retrieval and data analysis/graphics software will also              be provided.",
