 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts has been an                    active research facility for the study of forest ecosystems since               1907.  The central theme of this project is a comparison, in the                context of Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER), of historically                important physical disturbances and recent and projected chemical               disturbances in terms of their effect on forest ecosystem                       structure and function.  One fundamental question is whether                    chronic, low-level additions of pollutants can result in more                   lasting alteration of ecosystem function than does a historical                 regime of more acute disturbance to which components of the                     system may be adapted.                                                               Four core experiments involve: 1) re-creation of physical                  types of disturbance, including catastrophic hurricane blowdown,                smaller windthrows and selective mortality of overstory species,                2) simulation of chronic chemical disturbance by altering inputs                of important nutrients or pollutants, 3) interactions between                   physical and chemical disturbances, and 4) repetition of                        treatments to assess the range of variation in organism and                     ecosystem response.  Synthesis of the research will be achieved                 through the application of remote sensing, geographic information               systems, and modelling.                                                              The integrated research group has a long history of                        interaction at the Harvard Forest and has expertise in                          physiological ecology, plant development, forest microbiology,                  paleoecology, ecosystem studies and atmospheric chemistry and                   experience with such research tools as remote sensing, geographic               information systems, stable isotopes, ecosystem and atmospheric                 modelling, micrometerological techniques, and trace-gas                         measurement.  The Harvard Forest research group will integrate                  the expertise of scientists from three participating                            institutions.                                                                        The research site is an interesting one with good                          accessibility and excellent facilities.  Institutional support                  for the LTER effort appears to be adequate.  The research team is               quite well qualified, led by a respected senior scientist and,                  for the most part, familiar with operating in a fashion conducive               to the productive execution of a large, multi-disciplinary                      project.                                                                             The Ecosystem Studies Programs enthusiastically recommends                 that funds be provided as a six-year continuing award to support                the inclusion of the Harvard Forest Project in the national LTER                network.",
