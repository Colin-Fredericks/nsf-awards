The specific compounds being                                            investigated are 1, 1, 1-trichloroethane,                                       trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride.                                          Previous work has shown that these compounds                                    can be degraded aerobically by methane and                                      propane oxidizing bacteria but has neglected                                    the competitive effects of the growth                                           substrate and the chlorinated hydrocarbons on                                   the rate of degradation.  In this work, the                                     effects of methane and propane levels on the                                    degradation rate of the target compounds will                                   be determined and the results applied to                                        developments of model sequencing batch                                          reactors for degradation of those compounds.                                                                                                                    A mathematical model that can be utilized in                                    the engineering design of bioreactors for                                       treatement of wastes containing chlorinated                                     hydrocarbons is the expected result of this                                     research.  Successful completion of this                                        research will provide information that is                                       essential for design of high-rate, aerobic                                      biological systems for destruction of                                           chlorinated hydrocarbons of pollutional                                         significance.",
