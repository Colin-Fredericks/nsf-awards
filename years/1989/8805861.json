 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bruchid beetles are parasitic on the seeds of their host                   plants, and their degree of host specificity may be an important                factor in their geographic distribution and evolutionary history.               Dr. Clarence Johnson is a recognized authority on the systematics               and biogeography of South American bruchids, and he proposes                    continued investigation of their taxonomy, distribution, ecology                and evolution.  The proposed research would involve extended                    field collecting and the first application of new computer-based                methods for reconstructing evolutionary relationships among                     bruchids.                                                                            The proposed research will have impact beyond the narrow                   confines of beetle systematics.  The patterns found among bruchid               species and genera can be used to test biogeographic hypotheses                 based on other organisms.  Beetle-host plant relationships will                 impact on a broad range of coevolutionary hypotheses.                           Application of modern analytical tools will serve as a model for                entomologists in general.",
