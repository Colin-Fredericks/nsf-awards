 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a database of Iceland demography during                most of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  The PIs will                  add to an existing database of birth and marriage records,                      enlarging it by adding death, confirmation and household                        composition records.  The database will be created on a                         microcomputer in a management system that would permit its use on               advanced microcomputers and mainframe equipment, and it will be                 made available at cost to scholars.                                                                                                                             The completed database will be a valuable tool for                              reconstructions of historic Icelandic society and a resource                    affording all scholars a unique opportunity to deal with an                     entire nation.  Previous reconstructions of life histories,                     households, and families have relied on samples of parish                       registers, necessarily tending to lose the more mobile members of               the population, a drawback this database would circumvent.                                                                                                      This research is important because it will provide a unique set                 of information to demographic researchers, to help refine                       theories of family and household growth and change.",
