 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant productivity is largely dependent on the photosynthesis rate of           leaf canopies throughout the growing season.  Because the environment           surrounding a leaf is constantly changing, plants must modify the               photosynthetic apparatus to compensate for the effect of environmental          change if they are to maintain high rates of productivity.  While recent        work has focused on elucidating mechanisms of the photosynthetic                response to rapid, short-term change in the environment, understanding          of the mechanisms driving acclimation to seasonal, long-term change is          limited.  This work will study the mechanisms controlling the                   acclimation of photosynthesis to long-term changes in the environment,          specifically light and CO2.  The principal hypothesis is that following         a change in light intensity or ambient CO2 level, the amount of protein         invested in the component processes of the photosynthetic apparatus will        be adjusted so that a balance is maintained between each step in the            photosynthetic pathway.  Thus, if a change in the environment leads to a        single step limiting photosynthesis, nitrogen and carbon would be               reallocated from nonlimiting processes and invested into the limiting           process, increasing the rate of the limiting process and the overall            photosynthesis rate.  In fully acclimated plants, resources may be              allocated optimally so that no single step limits photosynthesis.                                                                                               This work will improve understanding of the factors limiting growth,            photosynthesis, and resource use efficiency in realistic environments.          Our ability to identify beneficial traits, and to model and predict the         performance of crop as well as wild plants will be substantially                enhanced.  In light of the significant change in global environments,           particularly with respect to atmospheric warming and rising CO2, an             improved ability to predict how plants respond to long-term                     environmental change will be invaluable for estimating the impact of            global change on natural and agricultural ecosystems.",
