 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is requested for the purchase of a computer-interfaced CD               spectropolarimeter for use by several investigators within three                different departments of the university.  A common interest among               the primary users is the determination of the conformation and                  structure of both water-soluble and membrane-bound peptides and                 proteins.  Several users also have strong research efforts                      directed toward the investigation of the thermodynamics of                      protein stability and the kinetic mechanism of protein folding                  and unfolding.  Thus, an instrument has been chosen based on its                capabilities to obtain high quality far-UV spectra as well as the               ability to make measurements as a function of temperature and on                a rapid time scale.  Access to this instrumentation, which is                   presently unavailable, would enhance the research efforts of                    several groups, and would foster new collaborative efforts to                   study protein structure and function relationships at UAB.",
