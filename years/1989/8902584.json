 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is intended to provide a detailed case study                      of the social processes involved in community and household                     recovery from the October 1987 earthquake in Southern                           California.  The research is longitudinal in design and                         will obtain data at two points, 20 and 30 months post-                          impact.  In addition reconstruction issues and actions will                     be monitored continuously for the duration of the project.                      The project has 5 major objectives: (l) To provide a                            description and analysis of the recovery process for both                       community and households.  (2) To analyze the                                   interrelationships among agencies and organizations                             involved in the reconstruction process.  (3) To examine                         recovery issues and actions at the household level through                      a longitudinal survey of heavily damaged households,                            including aid and insurance utilization.  (4) To describe                       and analyze the reconstruction process in Whittier in terms                     of political processes involved in promoting recovery and                       mitigation plans, with a particular focus on interest                           groups and emergent organizations.  (5) To provide a set of                     policy recommendations based on the project's findings and                      to summarize in a monograph all recent research on the                          Whittier earthquake.  Data will be gathered using detailed                      surveys of households, interviews with agency personnel,                        political leaders, citizens groups and other community                          influentials.  Interview data will be supplemented with                         reports, records and other documentary materials.",
