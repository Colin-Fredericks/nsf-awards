 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will focus on the regional metamorphism and                          deformation of Precambrian basement rocks in the central                        Transantarctic Mountains of Antarctica.  These rocks are                        significant because they comprise some of the only high-grade                   basement terrains exposed in the Transantarctic Mountains which                 represent a part of the ancient East Antarctic craton.  As such,                their petrogenesis and tectonic evolution are important for a                   better understanding of how the paleo-Antarctic craton evolved                  and how the supercontinent Gondwana formed.  The position of                    these rocks near the edge of cratonal West Antarctica provides a                unique opportunity to study the relation between the tectonic                   elements of the Archaen and Proterozoic shield, and younger                     crustal elements formed along a convergent Antarctic plate                      boundary.                                                                                                                                                       This integrated study of deformed Precambrian metamorphic                       terrains will involve:  1) detailed field geologic mapping and                  sampling; 2) structural, microstructural, kinematic and fabric                  analysis; 3) metamorphic petrology and quantitative                             geothermobarometry involving both major element exchange and                    oxygen isotope techniques; and 4) isotopic geochronometry.  The                 duration of the proposed project is three years, including field                seasons during the first two years.",
