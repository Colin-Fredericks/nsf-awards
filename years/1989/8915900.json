 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Katmai Scientific Drilling Project is a large multi-                   agency project (NSF, DOE, USGS) which will be coordinated by the                Interagency Coordinating Group (ICG) for Scientific Drilling.                   The membership of ICG consists of the same three agencies.  The                 National Park Service has received notice that the ICG will                     submit a proposal to drill at Katmai.  While they are sympathetic               to the aims of the research, the Park Service wants to determine                whether Katmai is uniquely suited to the particular goals of the                project.  Accordingly, the Park Service has asked that the ICG                  support an independent assessment of this aspect and suggested                  the National Academy of Sciences as an appropriate organization                 for the study.                                                                       In response to the request from the Park Service, the                      NAS/NRC has established a Panel on Volcanic Studies at Katmai,                  under the aegis of the U. S. Geodynamics Committee.  This is a                  request for NSF's share of the support for the Panel.  The total                cost for the panel will be $34,700, so NSF's share is $11,566.                  This amount will be transferred to the U. S. Geological Survey                  which is handling the grant to the NAS/NRC.",
