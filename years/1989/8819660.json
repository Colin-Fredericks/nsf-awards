 "awd_abstract_narration": "Various important industrial processes involve flow of polymers in              regions of spatially varying dimensions.  In such flows the fluid               elements experience a deformation history with large and time-                  dependent extensional and shear components.  Non-Newtonian effects are          important and need to be understood.  Local information on stress and           velocity cannot be obtained directly in most applications, at least by          current methods, nor can the behavior be predicted with confidence              because available constitutive equations are untested for relevant              flow histories.  Work under this grant will use a wavy wall channel             and state-of-the-art noninvasive measurement techniques to explore              such flows.  Results are expected to form a necessary base for                  quantitative understanding of polymer flows in these important                  regions.                                                                                                                                                        Among the most common examples of flows of this type are the flow of            polymer solutions in porous media, encountered in enhanced oil                  recovery, and the flow of the polymer modified oils in lubrication.             However, a technology of growing importance, the formation of                   composite materials by the injection of polymer melts or of reactive            polymeric liquids into open-structure matrices, provides an additional          strong incentive for this research.",
