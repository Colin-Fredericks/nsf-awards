 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research program are to investigate and                  clarify fundamental questions on compressibility behavior of                    natural soils and to develop or refine methods for measurement of               compressibility parameters, interpretation of field observations,               and analysis of settlement of structures.  The specific questions               to be investigated include the uniqueness of the end-of-primary                 void ratio-effective stress relationship, behavior of the coeffi-               cient of lateral pressure, methodology for settlement and pore                  pressure analyses, and secondary compression of clean sands.  The               research method relies on exacting experimental techniques and                  long-term laboratory and field observations as well as mathemati-               cal modeling and numerical analysis.  A distinct feature of the                 project is that high quality undisturbed samples of natural clays               are being used in laboratory investigations.  The intention is to               rely on observation as the primary basis for developing physical                and mathematical models and to assure the generality of the                     concepts through the use of an extensive data base and                          comparisons with soil response to full-scale construction.                      Previous accomplishments confirm that a clear understanding of                  consolidation is: a significant event in the geological history                 of natural soil deposits; an important mechanism in soil                        improvement through densification; and an intended stage or an                  undesirable effect in laboratory or in situ measurement of soil                 properties.  Settlements associated with consolidation and                      corresponding changes in permeability, deformability and shear                  strength of soils are all important factors of practical concern                in geotechnical design, construction and performance of                         structures.",
