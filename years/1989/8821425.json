 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the theoretical study of rasterization theory          and the prototyping of the developed rasterized structure.  A real-time         rasterized structure is being developed.  In this new architecture, the         desired computations are performed in the time interval between the             arrivals of two neighboring pixels without extensive buffering and              reformatting of the data.  This is achieved by transforming a                   multidimensional computation into a one dimensional one and by                  processing the transformed data.  A rasterization theory is being               developed which provides a mathematical basis for translating many              multidimensional computations, constrained to utilizing scan-line data          in real time, into their equivalent one-dimensional computation.                Many computations require global data communication as well as the              real-time evaluation of large quantities of data.  Computational                architectures are often constrained by the format in which the input            data is available, namely, raster-scan format.  However, the operations         to be performed are often global in nature.  This input/output format           constraint would hinder full utilization of parallelism without                 extensive buffering and reformatting of input/output data.  This                research develops the necessary computational model, which makes                possible the design of a balanced structure of computations and                 inputs/outputs.",
