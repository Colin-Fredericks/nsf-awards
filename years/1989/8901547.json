 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study several questions                    arising from the analogues in several complex variables of the                  problem: can you hear the shape of a drum?  One question is                     whether there is an analogue of the Riemann-Roch Theorem for CR                 manifolds.  Another concerns the small-time off-diagonal behavior               of the heat kernel on CR manifolds.  Investigations of normal                   forms for rigid hypersurfaces will continue.  And she will search               for an algebra of pseudodifferential operators which contains a                 parametrix for the Kohn Laplacian on CR manifolds of finite type.                    Can you hear the shape of a drum?  Was it circular or                      square?  This question was first addressed in a mathematical                    context by V. Kac and continues to inspire intense study.                       Ramifications to signal processing theory are manifold.  The                    principal investigator will continue her study of the complex                   analogues to this question, a field of study in which she already               is the foremost authority.",
