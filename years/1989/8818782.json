 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lake ecosystems in temperate zones are influenced both by                       seasonally-varying external forces and by internal                              biogeochemical cycling; however, hydrologic mixing and                          dilution may obscure the importance of some biogeochemical                      processes.  In contrast, lakes in the Dry Valleys of                            Antarctica are influenced by a seasonality that is simple in                    the extreme, are stabilized by a permanent ice cover, and                       receive proportionately minor annual inputs of chemical                         constituents, including organic material and nutrients, from                    glacial meltwater streams.  Therefore, these lakes are                          uniquely suited for the study of processes involved in the                      internal production and degradation of organic material. This                   study will focus on the chemical and biological changes                         occurring during the austral winter (constant darkness) and                     the austral summer (constant daylight) and on the interaction                   or feedback mechanisms between processes occurring in major                     zone of these lakes.  The study will be accomplished by                         measuring key autotrophic and heterotrophic processes and                       related chemical parameters, by quantifying lake hydrology                      and by deploying sampling devices to operate during the                         winter.  Knowledge of these lake ecosystems will enhance our                    understanding of internal biogeochemical cycling in other                       lakes.",
