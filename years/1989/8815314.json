 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support cooperative research between Dr. Richard J.             Higgins and his research group at Georgia Institute of Technology               and Dr. J. C. Portal, Laboratoire de Physique des Solides, Institut             National des Sciences Appliquees, Toulouse, France.                             Drs. Higgins and Portal will study the electronic and                           optoelectronic properties of 3-5 compound semiconductor                         heterostructures.  The research will emphasize coherent (quantum)               electronic effects, and identify growth and processing issues that              inhibit quantum electronic devices.  Two test systems will be                   studied:  (a) coupled quantum well structures grown by molecular                beam epitaxy, whose negative differential resistance promises                   sub-picosecond switching, but whose application is hampered by poor             understanding of the physical behavior and (b) nanometer-scale                  structures patterned by e-beam lithography which can exhibit                    phase-coherent ballistic transport.                                                                                                                             Both the U.S. and French investigators have an active collaboration             with shared research objectives in heterostructure                              magnetotransport.  Techniques include magnetotransport to probe                 electronic behavior, pulsed light to alter defect charge state, and             pressure to shift energy levels.  Dr. Higgins' group brings                     strengths in Fourier Transform Landau Level spectroscopy.  The                  French group has expertise in magnetotransport in heterostructures              and also in high pressure measurements, valuable for                            heterostructure studies.  The results of this research will:  1)                increase understanding of semiconductor quantum-well                            heterostructure and quantum-size effect devices; and 2) contribute              to the technology base of solid state electronics.",
