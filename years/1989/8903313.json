 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Shelstad will continue her study of the transfer                 of orbital integrals in endoscopy and twisted endoscopy, along                  with applications in local harmonic analysis and to distributions               associated with comparisons of Arthur - Selberg trace formulas.                      This has to do with the representation theory of Lie groups.               These fundamental mathematical objects arise naturally in several               ways. One basic example of a Lie group is the group of rotations                of a sphere, where the group operation consists of following one                motion by another. Detailed information concerning this group is                very helpful in solving mathematical or physical problems in                    which spherical symmetry is present. Other groups of motions                    capture other kinds of symmetry. A more algebraic (as opposed to                geometric) source of examples of Lie groups comes from the                      multiplication of matrices. The group of all invertible real (or                complex) matrices of a given size is a Lie group, as is just                    about any subgroup thereof that can be described in a natural                   manner. It is desirable to be able to go back and forth between                 the geometric and algebraic points of view, for instance to                     consider the numerous ways in which the rotation group of the                   sphere can be realized as a group of invertible matrices. This,                 roughly, is representation theory. Facts about the                              representations of a given group tend to store a lot of                         information very economically. Transfer of this information                     (between two different ways of keeping track of the                             representations of a single group, or between two different but                 mathematically related groups) is the underlying theme of                       Professor Shelstad's research project.",
