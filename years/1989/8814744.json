 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most island biogeographic studies suffer because they lack                 information on island habitats relative to mainland sites and                   they record only species presense-absence rather than density.                  In a limited number of previous studies, plants have been shown                 to have high immigration and low extinction rates on continental                islands generally, and hence such islands are relatively species                rich with low endemism.  This study proposes to extend work begun               in 1981 on the plant diversities, densities, and distribution on                islands in Barkley Sound, Vancouver Island Canada.  The new                     research will examine plant distributions as functions of habitat               availability on various islands, turnover dynamics as functions                 of both biotic and abiotic factors on islands, and the short-term               population and evolutionary consequences of the more dynamic                    species in the system.  With a range of 185 islands from inshore                rocks to over 30 km distant from \"mainland\", varying in size over               5 orders of magnitude, and with a very diverse flora with widely                different growth forms, habitat requirements, dispersal and                     reproduction dynamics, the Barkley Sound system is ideal for a                  closer examination of many of the questions that currently cause                dissent among ecological biogeographers.  Proposed research will                focus on habitat definition and quantification, classification of               habitat quality for plant species, assessing the causes of                      species turnover, quantifying dispersal variables in two plant                  groups, soft-fruited species that are bird-dispersed and                        parachuted species that are wind-dispersed, and examining the                   effects of herbivory on colonization and the evolutionary                       consequences of island life to dispersal-related morphology and                 herbivore resistance.",
