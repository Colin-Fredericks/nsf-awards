 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two very successful cruises were taken to the Florida                           Escarpment during 1986 that are yielding very stimulating data.                 Two sites were surveyed with \"Deep-Tow\", representative                         sections of the escarpment were seabeamed, and twelve ALVIN                     dives were conducted mostly at sites of chemosnythetic \"seep\"                   communties where detailed geochemical and geological sampling                   was conducted.  The program objectives are: 1) to detail the                    morphology and processes of generation of the steep (-45o)                      limestone escarpment, and to establish the relationship between                 the escarpment itself and the sulfidic/methanogenic pore-fluids                 which seep out onto the seafloor at its base, 2) to determine                   the source of the reduced chemicals in the seeping fluids and                   to understand the range of processes which are occurring at the                 seafloor associated with the seeps, and 3) to characterize the                  nature of the deposits generated by these processes, and to                     establish the criterion for their recognition in the rock                       record.                                                                         %%%                                                                             Previous work on this project has revealed an anonymously steep                 escarpment off Florida that appears to be the result of                         erosion.  Samples from the base of the escarpment reveal                        sulfide deposits that have formed in response to venting of                     fluids from the limestone rocks.  The chemistry of these fluids                 will be investigated using the chemical precipitates they have                  left behind in order to better understand the venting process.                  The results from the modern record will allow better                            recognition of these processes in the rock record.",
