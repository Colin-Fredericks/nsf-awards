 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for approximately twelve U.S.               computer scientists to participate in a joint workshop in Finland on            the state of the art in large scale scientific computing.  The                  meeting was organized by Professor Gene Golub of Stanford University            and Professor Olavi Nevanlinna of the Mathematics Department of                 Helsinki University of Technology.  It will be held in conjunction              with the annual meeting of the Nordic Section of SIAM (Society for              Industrial and Applied Mathematics.)  Finland has a strong tradition            in numerical analysis, particularly in such topics as mixed finite              elements, numerics on free boundary problems, and numerics on                   integral equations.  However, mathematicians there have relatively              little experience in large scale computing.  The Finnish State                  Computer Center has just acquired its first supercomputer, which has            greatly expanded the potential for scientific computing in Finland.             The workshop will focus on large scale computing in general and                 numerical linear algebra in particular, and is expected to stimulate            U.S.-Finnish cooperation in these areas.  The U.S. participants                 should benefit greatly from the experience of the Finnish group in              applying finite element techiques in a wide variety of situations,              including some novel applications.                                                                                                                              With the advent of new computer architectures and more powerful                 computers, it is necessary to consider anew the link between numerical          analysis and computer architectures.  Many algorithms which have been           discarded in the past are now returning to the forefront.  These                algorithms can greatly affect a computation and can play a role in              the formulation of the design of the solution method.  This workshop            will focus further attention on the relation between the problem                formulation and the methods which are used for solving these problems.",
