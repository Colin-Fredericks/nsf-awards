 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embryonic tissues of a multicellular eukaryote diverge through                  the selective expression of their common genetic constitution.                  The long term goal of this research is to understand the basis of               cell specific gene expression during differentiation. Dr.                       Ratner's experimental system is the cellular slime mold,                        Dictyostelium discoideum, in which spore and stalk cells develop                from common vegetative precursors. Dr. Ratner is studying the                   regulation of prespore gene expression. Several prespore genes                  require developmental protein synthesis for their transcription;                in the case of another gene, transcripts are made but quickly                   decay. Dr. Ratner has cloned one gene of the first class, and                   shall obtain a genomic clone of the latter type. Both genes will                be analyzed by restriction mapping and sub-cloning, RNase                       mapping, and DNA sequencing. Presumptive control regions will be                mutagenized in vitro, ligated to a unique \"reporter\" DNA                        fragment, and transformed back into amoebae. In vivo transcript                 levels will be measured by RNA hybridization in order to identify               cis-acting regulatory sequences essential for DNA transcription                 or mRNA stability. Any essential DNA sequence thus discovered                   will be used, in gen retardation assays, to search for DNA                      binding trans-regulatory proteins.                                              %%%                                                                             During the development of any complex, multicellular organism,                  genetically identical cells descended from a single fertilized                  egg somehow differentially regulate the expression of their                     common genomes so as to achieve diverse forms and functions. This               project exploits the simple slime mold as a model to try to                     understand how this differential gene expression is controlled.",
