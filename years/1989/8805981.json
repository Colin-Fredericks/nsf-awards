 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearly all ionomers (ion-containing polymers) are exposed to               solvents either during synthesis, processing, or in their                       applications.  Plasticizers are often added in commercial                       formulations.  Interactions that can occur between solvents and                 the ionic salt species influence the local arrangement of the                   ionic groups, which has a profound influence on the properties                  of the ionomer both in solution and in the solid state.                              This research program is directed at a phenomenological                    understanding of the plasticization of ionomers.  Spectroscopic                 methods (electron spin resonance, infrared, and fluorescence)                   will be used to characterize the specific interactions that                     occur in ionomers containing low concentrations of organic                      diluents.  This, combined with small angle x-ray scattering and                 dynamic mechanical analyses, will provide the relationship                      between these interactions and the structure and properties of                  these materials.                                                                     A second aspect of this research is to exploit the                         variations in the ionomer microstructures obtained by exposure of               the material to different solvents to study the mechanism and                   kinetics of phase separation in ionomers.  These studies will                   also provide a means to unambiguously determine the effects of                  ionic aggregation on the glass-transition temperature, the radius               of gyration, and the viscoelastic behavior of an ionomer.",
