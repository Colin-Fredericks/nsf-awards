 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed here would tackle a difficult problem                     (\"heterogeneity\") which arises in the statistical modelling of                  relationships among concepts measured in nonhomogeneous                         populations. In theoretically driven research in many fields of                 social science, concepts have multiple measures and the measures                are related to each other and to concepts in ways that make                     estimation of statistics and interpretation of results very                     difficult. Taking this much as given, this proposal considers                   theadditional complications that arise when more than one                       subpopulation has their opinions or attitudes measured (e.g., in                public opinion or educational research). This additional                        complexity calls for special methods if practical problems in                   merely estimating unknown parameters are to be addressed. This                  PIproposes to investigate the use of methods (e.g., multilevel                  models) not typically used in past research. The PI is generally                accepted as one of the top scholars in this area of                             methodological research.",
