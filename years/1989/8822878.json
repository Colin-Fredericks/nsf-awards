 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is in the general area of analytical and surface                  chemistry and in the subfield of spectroscopy. The focus of                     this research is on improving the capabilities of analytical                    chemistry as applied to problems in microbiology. Particular                    emphasis is placed on the identification of bacterial and viral                 pathogens as well as improving the reliability of DNA                           sequencing. All of the proposed studies are based on the use of                 time-resolved fluorimetry for selective analytical measurement.                 A secondary objective of this research is to develop a new                      generation of laser-based analytical instrumentation.                                                                                                           This research is designed to explore the possible use of lasers                 for identification of bacteria and viruses. Methods for                         evaluating the structure of DNA will also be explored. All of                   these studies are based on the characteristic decay of                          molecules which emit light after excitation with laser light. A                 secondary goal of this research is to develop new types of                      instruments which use lasers for analytical measurements.",
