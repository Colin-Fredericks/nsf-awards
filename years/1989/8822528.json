 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in biochemistry                  between Dr. Kurt Drickamer, Columbia University and Dr. Ten Feizi,              Medical Research Council Clinical Research Center, Harrow,                      Middlesex, England.  The objective of the project is to study the               detailed carbohydrate binding specificities of certain animal                   proteins called mammalian lectins.                                                                                                                              A type of common carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) has been                 identified in proteins with diverse biological functions.  Proteins             containing these homologous domains include serum mannose binding               proteins and the hepatic membrane receptor, which mediates                      endocytosis of asialoglycoproteins.  Based on primary structure                 information, CRDs have been predicted and found in other proteins,              such as pulmonary surfactant apoprotein and core protein of                     cartilage proteoglycan.  Expression systems for producing these                 domains in Eschericia coli are being developed in the laboratory of                        _______________                                                      the principal investigator in the United States.  In this project,              a collaboration is proposed with Dr. Ten Feizi; his research group              has developed a method of blotting neoglycolipids which will allow              the investigators to determine the detailed saccharide-binding                  specificity of the various CRDs and which will also be used to                  identify endogenous ligands for the domains.  By combining the                  protein and molecular biology expertise of Dr. Drickamer's                      laboratory with the carbohydrate technology of Dr. Feizi's group,               it will be possible to initiate a powerful new approach to analysis             of the biological role of carbohydrate recognition.  Dr. Drickamer              is a leader in the molecular biology of mammalian lectins and                   related proteins and has demonstrated his ability to use                        recombinant DNA approaches for expression of the carbohydrate                   binding domain of these proteins.",
