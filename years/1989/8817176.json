 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thermal structure of the lithosphere block overriding a                subduction zone is complicated and diverse with surface heat flow               values ranging from the highest to the lowest regional values on                the earth.  The thermal characteristics of the Cascadia                         subduction zone in the Pacific Northwest of the United States                   have been extensively studied during the last 15 years,                         especially as regards the geothermal potential of the Cascade                   volcanic arc.  As a side result of these studies some data has                  been collected in the low heat flow outer arc block as well.  As                the primary objective of the project these data will be used to                 develop a time-dependent three-dimensional temperature model of                 the subduction zone and the outer arc block.  This temperature                  model will be used as a basis for evaluating the mechanical                     characteristics of the zone as a way to investigate the potential               for large subduction zone type earthquakes and to explore the                   unique setting of the Cascadia subduction as the reason that no                 deep focus earthquakes are associated with the zone.",
