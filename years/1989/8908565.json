 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lack of certain properties, such as completeness or termination, in         an algebraic specification of abstract data types is often the result           of design errors and can have significant consequences on processes,            such as code implementation or verification, which rely on the                  specification.  To alleviate the problem substantial efforts have been          devoted to understand better these properties and to implement tools            which may guarantee the presence of some properties or detect their             absence.                                                                                                                                                        To date, no work has yet been published for preventing design errors            rather than correcting them.  Two strageties are suggested which, under         reasonably general assumptions, can be used to produce specifications           which are complete, parsimonious, linear, and terminating.  The extent          to which these strategies are applicable is not yet known.  These               strategies are simple to use if the difficulties resulting from some            book-keeping they require is mechanized.  A prototipical implementation         improves significantly the productivity of designing specifications and         the specification quality.                                                                                                                                      The project has the following goals:                                                                                                                                 Explore the range of applicability of these strategies.  In some           situations, one property is not achieved, but it is still unclear               whether          the property is too strong or the strategy too weak.           Also, one strategy    is not the most convenient one in some                    situations.                                                                                                                                                          Investigate the existence of other strategies.  Examples show that         these            strategies are sufficient for achieving desirable              properties, but are not    necessary.  Other strategies with similar            goals and performances may      exist.                                                                                                                               Implement the available stategies.  Evaluate and improve their             effectiveness through their use for designing a set of basic, general           specifications.",
