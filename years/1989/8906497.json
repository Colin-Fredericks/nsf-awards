 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Dr.                 Keith S. Kyler of the Department of Chemistry at the University                 of Miami.  This research will lead to the harnessing of                         biochemical reactions as new tools in the synthesis of complex                  molecules by mild and possibly nonpolluting processes. It has                   considerable potential to produce the new chemicals needed in                   modern agriculture and medicine.                                                                                                                                The development of new enzymatic methods for the                                preparative-scale asymmetric synthesis will be undertaken for                   biologically important organic compounds.  New applications of                  an enzymatic method for the synthesis of steroids will be                       undertaken using the sterol cyclase from microbial sources, and                 demonstrate the use of this enzymic method for preparing                        valuable lanosterol, cholesterol, and cycloartenol steroids.                    Additionally, new enzymatic technologies will be developed for:                 (1) the chiral oxidation of pentadienyl glutarates using                        soybean lipoxygenase as a method for the asymmetric                             hydroxylation of unsaturated alcohols; and (2) the enzymatic                    reduction of imino esters using dehydrogenases as a  new                        approach to asymmetric syntheses of alkaloids.  Lastly, a study                 will be made into the use of synthetic peptide duplexes to                      function as synthetic pseudo-enzymes (SPEs) displaying                          molecular recognition properties of natural enzymes.",
