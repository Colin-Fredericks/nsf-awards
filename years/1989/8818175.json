 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to conduct research on                         the potential use of helium, injected into water, as a                          tracer to determine pathways used by the water in its                           movement through aquifers, suboceanic and other                                 hydrologically important environments.  Tracers now                             used for this purpose include various types of salts,                           dyes and radioactive substances.  This research                                 involves development of an instrument, based on use of                          a detector, the operation of which exploits the know                            high permeation of helium through quartz glass.  Plans                          are to evaluate the concept on several different types                          of problems that require the tracing of the movement of                         water including determination of the hydrological                               properties of aquifers, locations of interconnections                           between sources and sinks of pollutants, and tracing of                         pathways that provide for movement of water through                             fissured and fractured rocks.                                                                                                                                   The calibration of mathematical models that predict the                         fate of environmental pollutants that move through                              subsurface media and that are discharged into surface                           waters is dependent on use of tracers.  Helium is                               potentially advantageous for use as a tracer in                                 comparison with substances that are not inert and that                          exist environmentally in relatively large and variable                          background concentrations.  Helium is also relatively                           abundant in commercial quantities and is reasonably                             soluble in water.  This research may lead to use of                             helium injection as a tracing method to replace or                              complement current practices using conventional                                 chemicals, dyes and radioactive substances.                                     **",
