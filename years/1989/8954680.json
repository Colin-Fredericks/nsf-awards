 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association of Physics Teachers will conduct a national            conference to define critical issues facing two-year college physics            and astronomy faculty today and in the decades to come.  Judgments will         be formed as to how these issues should be faced and treated, resources         available and those to be needed will be assessed, and a set of                 recommendations will be published.                                                                                                                              A second conference objective is related to information collection.             Conferees will be selected in such a way as to ensure broad                     representation from each type of two-year college, as well as from many         parts of the United States.  In this way, it is anticipated that                information on current practice, student outcomes, and future trends            can be obtained.                                                                                                                                                As a result of the conference, regional task forces will be formed.             They will prioritize and prepare conference reocmmendations for                 publication.  They also will be charged with the responsibility of              following through on these recommendations at the local level.                                                                                                  Participants, the grantee, and other organizations will contribute an           amount equal to about 32% of the award toward the operation of the              project.",
