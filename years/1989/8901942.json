Field manipulations to determine the effect of                   each of the following factors on strength of association will be                conducted:  (1) individual phenotypic variability in lycaenid                   larvae; (2) variability in response by different species of ant                 associates; and (3) variability in host plant quality.  The                     dynamics of facultative associations, which occupy an                           intermediate position between casual associations and obligate                  mutualisms provide a key to understanding the transitions in                    interaction strength.  Investigation of the factors controlling                 the strength of facultative associations will provide information               on the evolution and maintenance of mutualism.  This study will                 also investigate whether association with ants reduces parasitism               or predation of the lycaenid larva, and the possibility that                    various species of ant associates provide differential benefits.                Specificity of the association may depend on the differential                   magnitude of the benefits provided by the various species of ant                associates or on the dependability of encountering the various                  species.  Determining if the strength and benefits of the                       association vary with the species of ant attendant will provide                 information on the trade-offs of the transition from polyphilic                 to monophilic association, and vice versa.",
