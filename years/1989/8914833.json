 "awd_abstract_narration": "The coastal bays play a critical role in the transport and                 transformation of land runoff to the ocean.  Drs. Hollibaugh                    and Smith will consider the role of bays and estuaries in the                   net flux of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous between the land                  and ocean.  The system of interest (Tomales Bay, California) is                 hydrographically simple, has a long water residence time, is                    sufficiently compact that it can be studied as a single unit,                   and has low inorganic nutrient pollution.  The system functions                 metabolically like numerous other coastal marine ecosystems.                    External sources of organic matter which support food chains in                 this system are simple to characterize and have strong seasonal                 and interannual signals.                                                             These investigators will address the following questions                   by means of a multi-investigator field and laboratory program:                  1)  What is the relative importance of coastal upwelling versus                 terrigenous runoff in delivering oxidizable organic matter and                  nutrients to this system?  2)  What are the responses of system                 metabolism and the metabolism of major system components to                     seasonal and interannual variations in these forcing functions?                 3)  What is the relationship between net system metabolism and                  non-conservative fluxes of nitrogen?  4)  Can rates derived                     from stoichiometric arguments be validated by \"direct\"                          biochemical assays.                                                                  It is anticipated that the outcome of this research can be                 extrapolated to other systems which may be applicable to                        management of the nations resources.  This effort is being                      funded as a Land Margins Ecosystem Research project in a                        program which is jointly supported by the Directorates of                       Geosciences and Biotic Systems and Resources.",
