 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lawrence Hall of Science will offer an opportunity to 80                    upper-elementary school teachers in two San Francisco Bay                       Area schools (Oakland and San Mateo) to develop their                           leadership skills in the first component of the Science                         Update project.  These teachers will be called the science                      impact teachers.  The second component of the project will be                   an onsite development component in which the impact teachers                    inservice the other teachers at their schools.                                                                                                                  Forty teachers from twenty schools (Group A) will participate                   in a program extending over three years in which they will                      spend two weeks in the summer of year one, one week in each                     of summers two and three, followed by ten academic year                         meetings in between.  The first summer will focus on the                        Science Update Course, the second summer on staff development                   methods and  the third summer working with at least 200 of                      their peers under the tutelage of the LHS staff.  During the                    second year a second group of forty teachers (Group B) will                     begin the replication of the process.  Thus a total of 80                       impact teachers will be trained to provide the educational                      and scientific resources necessary to improve the science                       education at their schools.                                                                                                                                     The science content and methodology used will be drawn from                     the NSF-funded Full Option Science System (FOSS) materials.                     These materials are easy for teachers to use and are designed                   to be accessible to all students, including disabled,                           minority and disadvantaged.                                                                                                                                     An amount equivalent to 23% of the NSF request has been                         cost-shared by the University, the school districts and the                     distributor of the FOSS materials.",
