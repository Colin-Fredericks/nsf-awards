 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in structural optimization has grown considerably in                   recent years, in part due to the emergence of powerful                          supercomputers.  However, structural practitioners have achieved                uneven success in obtaining optimal design parameter for large-                 scale structures.  The purpose of the proposed research effort                  would be to develop efficient and reliable iterative procedures                 for minimum-weight design of large structures subject to                        multianalysis-type constrains (e.g., displacements, stresses,                   natural frequencies, and elastic stability).  Developments in                   numerical methods would be carefully reviewer to select the best                procedures to initiate, promote and accelerate convergence of                   optimal values for structural design parameters.  The procedures                would be organized into structured computer programs to permit                  periodic updates and enhancements.  The validity of the proposed                procedures would be checked against data available in the open                  literature and data generated in the course of a limited program                of proposed experimental work.  The focus of the effort would be                to suggest efficient design procedures for structural                           practitioners.  A three-year research project is proposed.",
