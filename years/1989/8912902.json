 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although significant progress has been made in studies of the                   greenhouse effect in many of the natural sciences, relatively                   little effort has been devoted to the downstream assessment of                  the economic and social impacts of the greenhouse effect.  This                 proposal is designed to improve understanding of both substantive               and methodological developments concerning the economic and                     social impacts of global environmental change, through both a                   regular workshop reviewing ongoing research and a program of                    research focusing on specific areas of global environmental                     change.  The workshop will involve bringing together social                     scientists and others working on energy and resource economics,                 forestry, agriculture, and methodology to improve both research                 techniques and substantive knowledge of the likely impacts                      arising from the greenhouse effect.  The other major task will                  focus on developing an hedonic model of the value of climatic                   variables for use in evaluating potential climatic changes.  This               technique will provide a much more detailed analysis of the                     economic impact of climatic change than have past studies, and in               addition will provide regional detail on the distribution of the                impacts of climatic change.",
