 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar, \"Marine Bioinorganic Chemistry\",             organized jointly by Prof. Kenneth L. Raymond of the University of              California, Berkeley, and Prof. Clifford Hawkins of the University of           Queensland, Australia.  Participants will meet on Heron Island,                 Australia in June 1989 to conduct joint field experiments and plan              collaborative projects in this new field. Bioinorganic chemistry is             the study of biological processes involving metal ions as key                   components.  As yet, in this rapidly growing field, the bioinorganic            chemistry of the sea has not been studied, although the discipline              should be of great importance due to the concentration and transport            of metal ions across concentration gradients, from seawater to                  organisms.                                                                                                                                                      The Heron Island Marine Research Station, the largest and best-equipped         on an Australian island, is an ideal location for a seminar intended            to stimulate research in this important field.  This research could             lead to new discoveries in the biology of terrestrial and marine inver-         tebrates, and possibly eventually to the development of new therapeutic         compounds for humans.",
