 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by eight U. S.                scientists in a workshop for development of a program of                        cooperative research in computer science.  The workshop is to be                held in Hyderabad, India where the host organization, the CMC                   Limited, has its Research and Development Center. CMC is a                      Government of India Enterprise focusing on electronics, computer                science and communications.  The workshop will address areas of                 common interest to the two countries' scientists, including:                    artificial intelligence; computer vision; software engineering;                 networks; computer architecture; and software systems.  The                     workshop will also discuss the most suitable areas for productive               collaboration and the mechanisms of collaboration.  A workshop                  report will be  produced and disseminated in the U. S. and India.               Visits by participants to specific Indian research facilities will              be made to enhance the development of working relationships.                                                                                                    Scope:  The rapid development of computer applications and the                  revolution in information handling and utilization including new                areas such as artificial intelligence and computer vision are                   recognized by scientists in the U. S. and in India.  The Government             of India is placing great emphasis on making rapid advances in this             field, especially in software systems and software engineering.  It             is highly likely that a strong match between the U. S. and Indian               research interests exists and that good cooperative research                    activities would result from this project.",
