 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Anthony R. Ingraffea of Cornell University in           a research collaboration with Dr. Hans P. Rossmanith of the Institute           of Mechanics of the Technical University of Vienna.  The objectives             of their cooperative research are to further the understanding of the           process of cracking in large concrete dams, to create a simulation              capability to diagnose the cause of cracking and evaluate repair                procedures, and to incorporate the resulting new knowledge and                  experience into improved design procedures for new dam construction.            Austria is among the world leaders in the construction of concrete              dams.  Case studies of a number of Austrian and U.S. dams currently             under repair or construction will be performed with the cooperation             of the owners or operators of the dams.  Simulations will be based on           advanced structural mechanics (including fracture mechanics, damage             analysis, and failure analysis), numerical modelling methods                    (including finite and boundary elements modelling), and                         state-of-the-art interactive computer graphics.  Special emphasis               will be given to the problems of crack avoidance and control by                 design, and technically sound and cost-effective repair of cracked              dams.                                                                                                                                                           Cracking in concrete dams is a problem of considerable importance.              The results obtained from these case studies should guide and support           designers, builders, operators, and repair personnel of large                   concrete dams.  The cooperative nature of the project will hasten the           development of simulation capability, broaden the data and knowledge            bases on both sides, engender better cooperation from owners and                operators of the dams, and transfer practical failure analysis                  expertise to the U.S. and 3-D simulation expertise to Austria.",
