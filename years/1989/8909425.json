 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the transformation of water rights in                     Hawaii from 1820-1905 through in-depth interviews with local                    elders and systematic analysis of archival records and data                     (e.g., Water Commissioner Reports; Hawaiian and English language                newspapers; District Court Records and Minute Books; Journals,                  Reports, and Letters of American Missionaries). The purpose of                  the study is to illuminate how state law affects indigenous legal               systems and customary practices regarding the allocation of                     natural resources.  Hawaii between 1820 and 1905 is an apt                      context for this research because customary practices of local                  people, imbedded within a world view of sharing and trusteeship                 over resources, clashed with a western view of resources and a                  western legal system of allocation based on ownership and                       contract enforcement.  Also, Hawaii is a very interesting case                  since Hawaiians were in control of the government and themselves                made many of the critical decisions to abandon local knowledge                  and embrace Anglo-American notions of the economy and law.                                                                                                      This research should expand our understanding of the relationship               between law and social change.  In particular, it should add to                 knowledge of how the legal system affects culture in non-legal                  ways and how law silences certain voices and releases and                       encourages others in ways that go beyond a particular case or                   piece of legislation.  Further, the study should contribute to                  our understanding of how major changes in the rules of resource                 allocation transform the social context and how vastly different                belief systems as those of pre-contact Hawaiians and the Anglo-                 American common law merge to create new systems for resource use.               Given the scarcity of environmental resources and the depletion                 of resources like water, it is especially important to learn more               about how groups, communities, and nations arrive at arrangements               and resolve disputes about ownership and usage rights.",
