 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectroscopy is essential to chemists and biologists who are                    carrying out frontier research.                                                                                                                                 The Department of Chemistry of SUNY at Stony Brook will use                     this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program and the                    Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program to help                      acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer.  The areas of chemical                   and biological research that will be enhanced by the                            acquisition include:                                                                                                                                            1) Synthetic and biological chemistry of physiologically-active                    lipids, polypeptides and carbohydrates                                       2) Molecular receptors based on bile acids                                      3) NMR studies of synthetic anologs for the active sites of                        metalloproteins and heterogeneous metal-sulfide catalysts                    4) Site-specific enzyme and DNA modification                                    5) Heterocyclic synthesis and molecular recognition.",
