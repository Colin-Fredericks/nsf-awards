 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continuing support for a Research Experiences               for Undergraduates Site in the Department of Bacteriology at the                University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The program will provide an                   intensive summer research experience for ten undergraduate                      students in microbiology, molecular biology and related fields.                 Extra effort will be taken to recruit qualified students who are                women, minority or disabled, and/or who otherwise have limited                  research opportunities at their own institution.  The goal of the               program is to stimulate promising young scientists to pursue                    careers in research.  The Department of Bacteriology has an                     internationally recognized research faculty, committed to both                  undergraduate and graduate education, who will direct individual                laboratory research projects.  Participating students will work                 as part of a dynamic research team who are investigating basic                  questions in these areas of biology.  Students will become                      familiar with the research techniques of microbiology molecular                 biology and biochemistry using modern equipment and facilities.                 The Department has an established record of providing research                  opportunities for its own undergraduate students and has                        successfully managed a summer research program for REU students                 (and related students) in 1988.",
