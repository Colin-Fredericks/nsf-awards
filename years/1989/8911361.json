 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reaction engineering deals with the quantification of                           molecular interactions at solid surfaces, transport phenomena,                  dynamics and control of reacting systems and the interplay of                   all.  The application of reaction engineering principles is                     essential in experimentation, scale-up, and design for                          chemical, biochemical, petroleum, electro-chemical, and other                   processes.  Reaction engineering is an interactive discipline                   whose initial applications were confined to the petroleum and                   chemical industries.  Current utilization of these principles                   is spreading to the biotechnology, electronics, and specialty                   chemical industries where the emphasis is upon new materials.                                                                                                   This Third Engineering Conference in reaction engineering will                  be conducted in the \"Gordon Conference\" style and will                          concentrate on new materials and processes.  The first meeting                  in 1983 attempted to assess the state of chemical reaction                      engineering and the second one in 1987 placed emphasis on new                   frontiers in reaction engineering.  This third meeting will                     look at the production of new materials and will specifically                   cover four areas: (1)catalyst design, (2)ceramics, electrical,                  optical and magnetic materials, (3)the role of chemical                         reaction engineering in bioprocessing, and (4)polymers and                      composites.  It is hoped that the meeting will achieve timely                   and creative exchange of ideas, will broaden participant                        viewpoints, will increase industry-academic interaction, and                    will improve the education and exposure of young researchers.",
