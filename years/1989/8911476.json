 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Geison is examining the history of physiology at four leading               research schools in the discipline in the United States before                  World War II:  Chicago, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and Washington                  University, St. Louis.  Despite a rapidly growing body of                       literature on the history of the biomedical sciences in the                     United States, the technical and conceptual content of physiology               has attracted little attention. Of the four schools he is                       studying, only Harvard has been examined previously in any                      detail, and even in that case much remains to be done.  This                    study represents a preliminary phase in a broader study of the                  social, conceptual, and technical history of American physiology.               That larger study seeks to test the hypothesis that one can                     identify a distinctively \"American\" (or at least \"Anglo-                        American\") style of physiology, characterized by decentralized                  models of biological control hormones.  The initial focus here is               physiology at Chicago, partly because the research there carried                out by A. J. Carlson seems to run against the grain of this                     alleged \"American style\" but also because of an accelerating                    activity in the history of science at Chicago as that university                approaches its centennial celebration in 1992--thus allowing a                  comparative study of physiology with the other branches of the                  history of biology being studied there.  If this exploratory                    study works out, a broader research program will be pursued.",
