 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of formal and empirical methods to the study               of cognition, often called cognitive science or cognitive                       studies, has been rapidly gaining recognition as a valuable                     addition to undergraduate liberal arts education.  Carleton                     College first began to build a program in cognitive studies four                years ago.  Last year, funds from the Ford Foundation have become               available to the College to support faculty and student research                and curriculum development in this area.  A concentration (a                    formal program of interdisciplinary study) in cognitive studies                 has been added to the College curriculum this year as well.  We                 therefore are developing a cognitive studies microcomputer                      laboratory that  (1) meets the equipment needs of courses and                   student research in cognitive studies;  (2) fosters the                         development of a cognitive studies community that encourages the                exchange of ideas, methods, and questions across traditional                    disciplinary lines; and  (3) emphasizes the usefulness of                       computers and computer models for illuminating all aspects of                   cognition.  The laboratory consists of seven workstations and a                 printer linked to a large central file server that stores course                exercises and demonstrations as well as student research projects               for the entire cognitive studies program.  We also have                         peripheral hardware and software to encourage use by students at                all levels of the program.                                                                                                                                           The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal                    amount of funds.",
