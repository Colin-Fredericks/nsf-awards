 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glucosylases are ubiquitous in nature and form the basis for                    several industrial processes.  Therefore, greater                               understanding of the catalytic structure of these biocatalysts                  has both scientific and commercial importance.  The objective                   of this work is to provide information about the structural-                    functional relationships of these biocatalysts to enable the                    engineering of biocatalyst performance and specificity.  The                    model system to be investigated is cyclodextrin                                 glucanotransferase (CGTase).  CGTase and other glucosylases                     (e.g. alpha amylase, glucoamylase and alpha glucosidase) share                  regions of primary sequence homology, which have been                           implicated as the catalytic site for these enzymes.  However,                   whereas all these enzymes promote the hydrolysis of alpha 1,4-                  glucans, only CGTase promotes significant reformation of                        glycosidic linkages.  This study will examine the effects of                    changing specific amino acids within the CGTase catalytic site                  that are not homologous with corresponding residues in alpha                    amylase.  The goals of performing such substitutions are to:                    1) ascertain if these residues are the determinants of the re-                  ligation catalysis and , 2) determine if biocatalyst product                    specificity can be altered.  Mutations will be created by                       genetic site-directed mutagenesis techniques and transformed                    into E. coli.  Mutant biocatalysts will be characterized by                     their catalytic activity and product specificity on                             maltodextrins, starch and beta cyclodextrins.",
