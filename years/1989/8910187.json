 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of ultra-high-speed digital computing machinery,                capable of throughputs well beyond a 109 Instructions per second (IPS)          rate, is essential to the development of future high performance                communication, radar, control, image processing, as well as                     multidimensional signal processing systems.  This research is directed          towards that goal.  The research is based on the recent advancements            made to a 2000 year old branch of mathematics known as \"residue                 arithmetic\".  The Residue Number System (RNS) has received attention            over the last two decades because the advances in memory technology             combined with the system's ability for high-speed arithmetic provide            attractive solutions in many real-time Digital Signal Processing (DSP)          applications.  More recently the Quadratic Residue Number System (QRNS)         was introduced which offers significant hardware savings and throughput         enhancements for the case of complex multiplicative intensive                   environments.  The proposed research will extend the concept of the             QRNS to a higher order system, the so called Polynomial Residue Number          System (PRNS), that would have minimum complexity for operations such           as complex multiplication, convolution, crosscorrelation and                    autocorrelation.  The end product of this research will be the                  capability of designing high-performance communications, control and            image processing systems to meet the future needs for higher speed.",
