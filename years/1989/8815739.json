 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. Theodore Kuwana and colleagues at the              University of Kansas to collaborate with Prof. Yoshio Umezawa of                Hokkaido University over a period of two years.  They will attempt to           develop ultrasensitive and selective sensors for the detection of               biological substances, including neurotoxins. These sensors will be             based on the use of a protein-based receptor, which acts as a gate              for a membrane ionchannel.  In particular, this research will focus             on the glutamate binding protein, which is a constituent in the most            widespread excitatory chemical transmitter system in the central                nervous system, and is a candidate for a suitable protein-based                 receptor.                                                                                                                                                       The purpose of this research is to enhance the understanding of the             glutamate binding protein, and the program includes the isolation and           purification of GBP receptor ion channels, reconstruction of these              channels in various synthetic membranes, structural and functional              characterization, and determination of their genetic properties.  The           work brings together acknowledged experts on protein synthesis and              analysis from the two countries, and could have important implications          in the development of selective chemical probes.",
