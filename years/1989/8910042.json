 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taste reception begins when stimulus chemicals, called  tastants,               interact with the exposed membrane of specialized  receptor                     cells.  Transduction is the term for the sequence of  events that               follow binding of a stimulus to the cellular receptor sites,                    triggering electrophysiological events in the cell that  then                   lead to sending a nerve signal to the brain.  In the vertebrates,               this transduction occurs in special chemosensory  cells in the                  taste buds.                                                                                                                                                     This project will examine how the interaction between the                       stimulus and the receptor membrane leads to the                                 electrophysiological changes in the receptor cell.  The cell                    membrane has  channels that allow the flow of certain charged                   ions in and out.  During stimulation, some of these channels open               and close, with  specific time courses and dependence on the                    electrical gradient  across the membrane.  Taste cells are found                by the thousands all  over the body of catfish, making them easy                to isolate in large  numbers for study, and these catfish taste                 cells have known  classes of receptors for certain amino acids.                 This project will  use physiological and pharmacological                        techniques on isolated  catfish taste cells to characterize the                 ionic channels and  currents in their membranes, and to determine               how the binding of  specific amino acids activate those channels.               In addition, the  role of particular proteins for activating                    internal compounds  called second messenger molecules will be                   examined.                                                                                                                                                       Results from this novel model system will be very important to                  chemosensory science, and these studies are also likely to be                   helpful in studying synaptic mechanisms in neuroscience, in how                 receptor sites on nerve cells in the brain act during                           neurotransmission.",
