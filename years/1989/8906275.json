 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to conduct exploratory                         research on the conditions under which use of discrete                          interface penetration analysis can be used as a                                 diagnostic procedure for identification of the                                  mechanisms that are responsible for changes in the                              permeability of soils.  Permeability changes result                             from combinations of mechanisms such as colloid                                 destabilization and dispersion, shrinking or swelling                           of clay minerals, precipitations or dissolutions, gas                           liberation, and altered microbial activity.  Discrete                           interface penetration analysis is a new technique for                           modeling the impacts of reactive liquids based on the                           assumption that impacts can be represented by traveling                         interfaces separating areas of changing soil                                    properties.                                                                                                                                                     Much recent concern has focussed on interactions                                between hazardous wastes and hydraulic barriers, but                            this is a general class of phenomena significant in                             many areas of science and engineering.  Results of this                         project may have immediate applicability toward                                 improved engineering design of containment locations                            for hazardous wastes to minimize groundwater pollution.                         This project results from a proposal submitted in                               accord with NSF 87-90, Expedited Awards for Novel                               Research.",
