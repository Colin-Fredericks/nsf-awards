 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this Presidential Young Investigator Award are                to obtain a fundamental understanding of the structure and                      properties of thin solid film surfaces and interfaces and their                 relationship to the physics and chemistry of vapor deposition.                  Progress in these aspects of thin film science has been very slow               owing to the complexity of the deposition processes and the                     relative lack of in situ probes for studying nucleation and                     reactions at surfaces and interfaces, particularly in reactive,                 high pressure environments of chemical vapor deposition.  In situ               characterization gains importance as optical, mechanical and                    electronic applications become more demanding and film structures               must be made to more exacting specifications.  In situ                          spectroscopic cilipsometry (SE) is one monolayer-sensitive, non-                perturbat technique which will be applied to a range of such                    problems.  The experimental capabilities in the process of                      development will allow optical spectra be taken in real time at                 every Angstrom during the growth of these films.  Other optical                 techniques will also be developed.  The preparation capabilities                will include plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, and the                 physical vapor deposition techniques of evaporation (with and                   without ion assist), magnetron sputtering, and ion beam                         scattering.  Initial studies will concentrate on the nucleation                 and interface structure of microcrystalline diamond thin films                  and the response of their surfaces to well-characterized inert                  and reactive ion beams.  Similar experiments will be used to                    probe the nucleation, surface reactivity, and bonding for                       silicon-based films.  Other technologically important materials                 will be studied.  These experiments will be used to identify the                physical factors which conceal film bonding and morphology and                  impact materials technology.",
