 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin and diversification of land plants have been long               standing problems in botany, which the fossil record alone has                  been unable to resolve.  In recent years, it is molecular data                  from genome analyses that have demonstrated great promise in                    identifying the algal groups closest to the presumed ancestors of               bryophytes and vascular plants.  Dr. Manhart of Texas A&M                       University will join the small network of researchers analyzing                 chloroplast DNA gene order and sequences in order to determine                  the phylogenetic relationships of green algae and primitive land                plants.                                                                              The spatial order of genes on the circular DNA molecule of                 plant chloroplasts and the nucleotide sequences of functionally                 important chloroplast genes are highly conserved features of                    plant genome organization.  By analyzing similarities and                       differences in these two major features, Dr. Manhart will help                  determine the groups of Charophycean algae that most closely                    match primitive land plants in basic genomic structure.                         Comparable studies of select groups of mosses and ferns will                    provide an overall framework for the evolutionary connections                   among algae and early land plants.  The molecular datasets will                 be evaluated using computer methods to generate phylogenetic                    trees, and the results compared and integrated with morphological               and fossil evidence.",
