 "awd_abstract_narration": "The time evolution of the surface gravity wave field will be                    studied by combining a comprehensive field program in the Bight                 of Abaco with a fully non-linear model.  The investigation began                with the development of a two-dimensional wave array to measure                 the evolution of the wave spectrum and the meteorological forcing               by the wind.  Secondly, a new approach was developed for treating               the non-linear wave-wave interaction term to provide better                     resolution of the energy transport and a more efficient scheme                  for evaluating the effect of the interactions on wave evolution.                The present effort consists of a pilot field program in the                     spring of 1989 to be followed by a full experiment one year                     later.  On the modeling topic, an adjoint model necessary to                    optimize a systematic expansion of the unknown source terms will                be constructed.                                                                 %%%                                                                             This project couples a field program to measure the response of                 the surface ocean wave field to meteorological forcing with an                  attempt to develop a model incorporating the physical processes.                At present, a non-linear wave evolution model has been developed,               but required either massive computational effort, or a truncation               to an overly simplified representation.  This effort examines an                alternate representation to the non-linear terms, which, if                     successful, would permit an inversion of the data to better                     understand the physical processes at work producing the wave                    field.  The subsequent effort would then lead to a predictive                   model of the surface wave field forced by meteorological                        variables available from satellite or other techniques.",
