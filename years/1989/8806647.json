 "awd_abstract_narration": "North American species of chickadees are well-studied in                   terms of their biology, ecology, and behavior, but their                        evolutionary relationships are poorly understood.  They are                     generally thought to be descended from a Eurasian ancestor or                   ancestors, but the number and timing of invasions are not known,                and the order in which species have diverged remains unclear.                   Dr. Frank Gill of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia,                proposes to use restriction enzyme patterns in mitochondrial DNA                to unravel these questions.  These patterns will be compared with               data sets of morphology and enzyme proteins, and then synthesized               in an evolutionary study.                                                            The proposed research has implications beyond the interests                of taxonomists specializing on chickadees.  Biogeographers will                 be able to compare the timing and ecological conditions of                      invasions against those known for other groups.  The framework of               ancestor-descendant relationships will be available for                         comparative ornithological studies of behavior, ecology and                     anatomy.  Molecular biologists will gain an important case study                for comparing the rates at which different molecules evolve                     within a taxonomic group.",
