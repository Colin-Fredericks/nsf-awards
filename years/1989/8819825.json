 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate mechanisms of intraseasonal                 tropical wind variability associated with the \"40-50 day\" or                    \"Madden and Julian oscillation\" (MJO).  The research is motivated               by results suggesting that intraseasonal wind variance, though                  coherent throughout the tropics, may be separated into two                      dynamical regimes.  Within a \"convective regime\" across the                     western near-equatorial Pacific, wind anomalies on 40-50 day time               scales seem to be directly coupled to convection anomalies.  At                 other longitudes (within a \"dry regime\"), wind anomalies may be                 forced by seasonally-varying dynamical interactions with the                    extratropical circulation.  The objectives of the research are to               examine these two hypothesized mechanism, and the coupling among                dry and convective regimes and the extratropics, using time                     series analysis of observed data.                                                    It is anticipated that the results will yield a global                     overview of intraseasonal variability.  In addition to the goal                 of elucidating the MJO, which represents a significant fraction                 of the total variance of the tropical circulation, the work would               contribute more generally to better understanding of large-scale                ocean-atmosphere interactions in convective regions of the                      tropics, and atmospheric tropical-extratropical interactions.",
