 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ocean is not uniform in biological productivity (the                   growth of plant and animal life).  Instead, certain areas are                   many times more productive than others, largely reflecting                      differences in the supply of plant nutrients to surface water.                  One of the most dramatic examples of this in the world ocean is                 the equatorial area in the eastern Pacific Ocean and perhaps                    as much as 10% of all ocean productivity occurs here.  The                      Biological Oceanography Program recommends Dr. Barber's work                    for funding that involves large scale study of the                              productivity in this area.                                                                                                                                           This study expands on Dr. Barber's excellent earlier work                  on the productivity and temporal variability in the                             Peru coastal upwelling area and marks one of the first award                    recommendations in Biological Oceanography for a project                        dealing explicitly with productivity at a global ocean level.                   Such studies are crucial to our ability to monitor and predict                  large scale anthropogenic changes in the cycling of elements                    such as carbon which is both supplied to the atmosphere from                    upwelled water and absorbed from it by rapid phytoplankton                      growth.                                                                                                                                                              The project uses ship time on an ongoing NOAA project                      (EPOCS) in the area, and hence the NSF funding would leverage                   the availability of this existing platform.  The reviewers                      felt that the work addressed a significant aspect of marine                     productivity and that Barber's past accomplishments and                         expertise in the area augured well for the success of the                       project.                                                                                                                                                             In summary, the Biological Oceanography program                            recommends funding Dr. Barber's proposal at the request level.                                                                                                  Funding level:                                                                  FY89 - $89,828",
