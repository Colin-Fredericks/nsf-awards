 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to produce high performance and highly reliable                electronic equipment, electronics must be designed to withstand                 vibrational and thermal.mechanical stresses, space radiation                    effects, and must be producible, reliable, maintainable and cost                effective.  Thus, electronic equipment design tools must                        incorporate electrical, mechanical, reliability, maintainability                and logistic engineering requirements.  This requires that not                  only the tools for analysis and prediction be in place, but that                there are also system level design tools to integrate the                       analytical and computational techniques of design with                          optimization and decision support tools, all in a concurrent                    engineering software environment.  System level design tools will               increase the productivity and efficiency of engineers, an                       Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Computer                    Aided Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) at the University of                       Maryland.  The Center's research theme is to promote                            interdisciplinary basic study in the application and implications               of advanced technologies in the engineering design of electronic                equipment.  Research activities are built around four inter.                    related thrust application areas:  design for the life cycle,                   decision tools and artificial intelligence, modeling and                        analyses, and measurement science.                                                      Six industry members and one government laboratory have                 already joined the Center providing $350,000 support.  The                      University of Maryland had agreed to forego its overhead charges                (approximately $200,000 per year).  In addition, there are                      adequate computers, laboratory space and instruments for the                    proposed research at the university.                                                    The Program Manager recommends that the University of                   Maryland be awarded $50,000 each year for five (5) years for the                initiation of the CALCE Center.  An additional $50,000 is being                 transferred this year from the Naval Microelectronics Facility at               China Lake (California) via a Military Interdepartmental Purchase               Request.  Finally, $5,000 is being awarded to support a women                   undergraduate research assistant.  The total award for the first                year is $105,000.                                                                       Near the end of each 12.month period, the Program Manager               and/or Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review                 of the progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria,                  including the following:  (1) extent to which university/industry               interaction and collaboration is developing; (2) extent to which                the support base for the center is expanding; (3) extent to which               a robust research program is developing.  If review is                          satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support of the                 next period of this continuing grant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            //",
