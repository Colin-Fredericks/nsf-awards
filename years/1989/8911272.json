 "awd_abstract_narration": "A protein fraction isolated from Urechis sperm acrosomes has been               shown to activate eggs, causing electrical responses like the                   fertilization potential of sperm, as well as morphological                      changes typical of fertilization. Some peptide fragments from                   thermolysin digests of the protein fraction retain ability to                   activate eggs. Proposed experiments includes purification and                   sequence determination of the peptide(s) which activate eggs,                   and the attempt to identify with which components (\"receptors\")                 of the egg plasma membrane they interact. Of interest is whether                they might interact directly with the Na channels responsible for               the fertilization potential; reconstitution experiments will be                 directed towards this question. A model for the triggering of the               initial events in egg activation without second messenger system                is proposed and some aspects of this model will be tested (e.g.                 Do increases in intracellular pH and pCa occur at fertilization                 in Urechis? Are such increases required for activation? Can                     fertilization potentials occur when intracellular Ca is buffered                to low levels?) Whether isolated sperm surface components                       activate eggs in other species, as well as some aspects of the                  proposed model will also be tested with oyster gametes.                         %%%                                                                             This work addresses the question of how sperm interact with the                 egg surface to initiate development (activation). Even prior to                 sperm entry into the egg, a complex series of events are                        triggered in the egg by that contact that mark the beginning of                 the development of the organism.",
