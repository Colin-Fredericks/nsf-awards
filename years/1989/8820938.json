 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this research is to obtain an improved                 understanding of the mechanisms that determine the evolution of                 large-scale flow anomalies such as blocking. A second major goal                is to determine how the large-scale flow anomalies may influence                (and be influenced by) synoptic-scale eddies.  In order to                      achieve these goals, a combination of approaches will be                        employed to study the variations in synoptic-scale eddy activity                and the roles of various dynamical and physical processes during                different stages in the evolution of the large-scale flow                       anomalies.  Specific objectives of the proposed studies include:                applying synoptic and diagnostic approaches to analyze and                      compare numerical simulations of low-frequency variability in the               NCAR Community Climate Model with corresponding observational                   results, with particular emphasis given to assessing the                        adequacy of model simulation of the structures and life cycles of               persistent anomalies and blocking.  Diagnostic analyses will also               be employed to examine the relationships (in both the model and                 observations) between the large-scale flow anomalies and changes                in synoptic-scale eddy activity at various stages in the                        evolution of the large-scale flow patterns (i.e., during the                    development, mature and breakdown stages).  In addition,                        extensions to current analytical and theoretical models of                      blocking will be developed, concentrating particularly on the                   coherent structure models of Malguzzi and Malanotte-Rizzoli                     (1984) and Haines and Marshall (1987).  These models will be                    employed to further examine the roles played by various dynamical               and physical processes in the initiation, persistence and                       breakdown of the anomalous large-scale flow patterns.  This work                will enhance our capability to make seasonal forecasts.",
