 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographic variation refers to the widespread phenomenon of                variation within the range of species.  Understanding the origin                and maintenance of such variation is a primary goal of attempts                 to understand the evolutionary process itself.  This project is                 designed to clarify evolutionary processes that shape the                       geography of intraspecific genetic variation in three                           codistributed species of birds, namely, the Fox, Song, and                      Chipping sparrows.  In morphology, these species exhibit both                   marked geographic differentiation (Fox and Song sparrows) and                   phenotypic uniformity (Chipping sparrow) in their continent-wide                distributions.  In samples of birds taken throughout the range of               each species, genetic differentiation in mitochondrial DNA                      (mtDNA) and a series of genes that encode soluble proteins,                     called allozymes will be measured.  Such descriptive data on                    genetic variation within species provide a foundation for                       understanding the origin and evolutionary significance of                       geographic variation, and its relationship to the process of                    adaptation and speciation.  Examination of genetic data is                      crucial because evolution ultimately occurs at this level in                    populations.  By examining genetic variation in samples of these                three species, it will be possible to determine if geographic                   distance alone or \"vicariant\" events in earth history (such as                  the formation of mountain ranges) play a primary role in                        geographic differentiation, the initial step in evolutionary                    divergence.  No studies of avian genetic variation within and                   among codistributed species have been conducted on the                          geographic, continent-wide scale of the proposed study.  This                   study will provide the most detailed information on avian                       population genetic structure yet  available, for both proteins                  and at the level of the genetic code itself, (mt)DNA.  The use of               three species that occur over the same range increases the                      statistical power of interpreting patterns of variation.  The                   results will offer significant insight into the evolutionary                    process in general as well as the birds under study.",
