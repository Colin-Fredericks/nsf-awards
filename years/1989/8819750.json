 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goals of this research program are to                         understand the function of ionic channels in the membrane of                    smooth muscle cells and their regulation by transmitters, ions,                 metabolites, second messengers, and membrane potential.  Since                  ionic channels control the membrane potential, serve as one of                  the principal targets of neurotronsmitters and second messenger                 mechanisms, underlie the action potential, and govern calcium                   entry into the cell, they play a central role in the regulation                 of smooth muscle contraction.  The experiments employ freshly                   dissociated cells from the stomach of the bullfrog, Bufo marinus.               Emphasis will be placed on patch-clamp techniques to record both                whole-cell and single-channel currents.  The specific goals for                 which support is requested are studies of the mechanism of                      potassium channel activation by arachidonic acid and related                    fatty acids which has been observed in preliminary experiments.                 Studies will will be carried out to determine whether potassium                 channel activaton is caused by arachidonic acid and other fatty                 acids themselves or by metabolites derived from these fatty                     acids.  A variety of compounds structurally related to                          arachidonic acid and other fatty acids will be examined to                      establish which structural features are required for the                        molecules to be effective in inducing potassium current.                        Possible endogenous agents that may be releasing the fatty acids                will be sought and identified, and any additional effects of                    fatty acids on channels will be studied.                                             The role of arachidonic acid and other fatty acids as second               messengers in transmission of external signals to the biochemical               machinery within cells has recently become the focus of attention               in a number of cell systems.  The preliminary observations of                   Drs. Singer and Walsh that these agents appear to affect ion                    channels in the membranes of smooth muscle cells suggest a                      previously unexpected mechanism by which the excitability and                   contractile activity of these cells may be modulated.  The                      further analysis of these new observations may lead to important                insights into the mechanisms of regulation of contraction of                    smooth muscle, and more generally into the mechanisms by which                  the permeability of cell membranes is regulated.",
