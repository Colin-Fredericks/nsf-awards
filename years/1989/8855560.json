 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program will consist of a three-week summer institute for                   35 high-school biology teachers in each of two academic years                   (for a total of 70 teachers), with 2 two-day follow-ups                         during the academic year.  The program is designed to (i)                       prepare, or enhance, the teachers' knowledge of the nature of                   scientific inquiry, using the theory of evolution as the                        content subject; (ii) to encourage teachers to begin their                      biology courses with the topic of evolution and the nature of                   science, using them as central themes to integrate the                          remainder of the topics; (iii) to help the teachers to                          develop a dynamic, self-correcting method for becoming more                     effective, through formative and summative evaluation of both                   teaching courses.  The institutes will be presented in a                        variety of modes including lectures, demonstration, films,                      discussions, field trips, etc.  The follow-ups will increase                    appreciably the extent to which changes in content and                          curriculum are actually incorporated, and will allow further                    development of self-correcting implementation program.  Both                    formative and summative evaluations of teachers and courses                     will encourage a self-correcting approach to change.                                                                                                            An amount equivalent to 14.5% of the NSF award is being                         contributed by Indiana University as cost sharing.  The NSF                     cost per participant for the project is $4,308 in the two                       years' duration.",
