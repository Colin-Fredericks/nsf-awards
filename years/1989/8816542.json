 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two models for the transcriptional regulation of RNA polymerase                 synthesis will be tested.  The major site of transcriptional                    regulation appears to be modulation of the efficiency of a                      transcriptional terminator, the attenuator, upstream of the                     rpoBC structural genes.  The first model is that the attenuator                 is regulated by an antitermination system similar to those of                   phage lambda where the RNA polymerase is stability modified to                  a termination resistant form at an upstream site.  The                          existence of such a system will be detected by testing whether                  multiple heterologous terminators can be suppressed when placed                 in the rpoBC operon.  Given a positive result, the modification                 site will be identified by deletion analysis and                                oligonucleotide mutagenesis.  The factors required for                          modification will be identified in vitro using depleted or                      mutant extracts of known antitermination proteins and                           competition with other antitermination systems.  To identify                    specific for rpoBC, its expression will be uncoupled from the                   requirement for attenuator suppression, and detector operons                    will be constructed to allow selection for and screening of                     mutations affecting attenuator readthrough.  The ultimate aim                   is the reconstitution of the system with purified components.                   The second model is that coupling of transcription and                          translation in a gene rplL immediately upstream of the                          attenuator modulates termination.  This model will be tested by                 using lacZ:rplL gene fusions to control the translation at the                  3' end of rplL.  The important features of the sequence                         surrounding the attenuator will then be defined by deletion                     analysis and site directed mutagenesis.  In addition, the                       factors required for termination will be defined in vitro using                 purified components.  Finally, using partially purified                         extracts, whether a factor other than RNA polymerase and the                    ribosome modulates the coupling of transcription and                            translation will be explored.  These experiments will form                      basis for models defining how transcription of rpoBC is                         modulated in response to the transcriptional needs of the cell.                                                                                                 This research should provide fresh insights into regulation of a                gene that is of vital importance to the bacterium E. coli.",
