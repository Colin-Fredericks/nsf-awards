 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the progress that has been made in the field of                    computational geometry and solid modelling, only little has been                achieved in the field of interactive Computer-Aided Design (CAD).               A cost-effective design system should support an interactive user               in its interaction much more than current CAD systems do.  One of               the reasons for this deficiency, is that geometric objects are                  always looked upon as numerically represented objects by CAD                    systems.  Much information is lost when objects are translated to               the internal representation of such a program.  The understanding               of geometry is implicit in the algorithms which manipulate these                objects on a numerical level, rather than on an object level.                   With the Principal Investigator's approach, geometric objects and               their properties can be represented symbolically.  Therefore,                   manipulations of such objects and the results of the                            manipulations are meaningful for the interactive user.  The                     Principal Investigators will develop a geometric calculus for                   symbolically manipulating geometric expressions.  A theoretic                   framework will be developed to prove correctness and decidability               of geometric problems.  The approaches to be applied are                        term-rewriting methods and logic programming methods.  This                     research should result in a more powerful user interface for the                Alpha One Computer-Aided Design system, developed at the                        University of Utah.",
