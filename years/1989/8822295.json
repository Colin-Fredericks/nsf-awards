 "awd_abstract_narration": "The distribution of carbon black, or soot, is widespread                   with sources such as fossil fuel combustion and forest fires.                   Soot is a significant contributor to the global burden of                       suspended particulate matter in the lower atmosphere.  The                      reactivity and catalytic activity of particulate carbon are                     dependent upon the nature of its surface.  These heterogeneous                  chemical reactions are poorly understood, but their role in the                 chemistry of the atmosphere is becoming recognized as a                         possibly an important one.  In order to assess the importance                   of soot-related heterogeneous reactions, knowledge is required                  of the reactions of soot with atmospheric gases and the                         properties of soot responsible for those reactions.                                  This project is a continuation of work aimed at                            understanding the mechanisms through which the presence of soot                 influences the chemistry of atmospheric species including                       sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and ozone.  This work involves                 characterization of the surface properties of soots produces by                 various combustion conditions and identification of reactive                    intermediates and mechanisms.  This project will extend the                     research to photochemical processes under simulated solar                       radiation and to more atmospherically realistic multicomponent                  systems involving oxygen and water.",
