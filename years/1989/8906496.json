 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Malpighiaceae are a medium-sized family of tropical and                subtropical flowering plants, comprising about 65 genera and 1200               species, with 85% of the species native to the New World, the                   rest found in the Paleotropics.  The family is internally                       homogeneous and externally isolated, that is, the members all                   look a great deal alike and are clearly related, but do not                     closely resemble any other family.  Traditional systematic                      methods, relying principally on gross morphology, have failed to                resolve many questions of relationships within the family,                      because of the aforementioned similarity, and also to reveal                    where this family fits into the larger group of relatively                      unspecialized flowering plants (related to the rose group) whose                flowers have free parts in whorls of five.  The research proposed               by Dr. Mark Chase at University of North Carolina and Dr. William               Anderson at University of Michigan is designed to apply new,                    molecular techniques to these old, intractable problems.                             The chloroplasts of green plants contain numerous circular                 chromosomes, which are relatively easy to characterize because                  they hold so much less DNA than the huge nuclear genome.  Several               researchers have had great success in recent years at using                     comparative studies of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) to resolve                       problems in plant systematics.  Drs. Chase and Anderson plan to                 study the cpDNA of the Malpighiaceae and representatives of                     several putatively related families in two quite different ways,                attempting to answer questions about relationships within the                   family and between families.  Nucleotide sequencing of selected                 cpDNA genes will allow construction of an informative                           phylogenetic hypothesis for Malpighiaceae and related families.                 Then, using the technique of restriction site mapping, they plan                to compare the cpDNA of 60 species of Malpighiaceae that                        represent most of the diversity within the family.  The within-                 family phylogeny will resolve questions about whether                           functionally analogous and even morphologically similar fruits                  have evolved once or several times in parallel; how the genera                  are related to one another; and which of two diametrically                      opposed hypotheses about the place of origin of the family and                  the nature of the earliest members is correct.  Collaboration                   between the two workers, which combines the strengths of                        traditional morphological systematics with a modern molecular                   approach, should serve as a model for future collaboration                      between other traditional and molecular systematists.",
