 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Ronald               Lovett of Washington University and Dr. John Lekner of Victoria                 University, Wellington.  The investigators intend to develop a new              methodology for solving macroscopic rate equations for microscopic              processes governed by a Fokker.Plank equation, i.e., for a process in           which passage over a barrier is induced by generalized Browian                  motion.  In the 40 years since the Fokker.Plank equation was developed,         experience has only strengthened the belief that this equation                  provides a good description.  But solutions have only been clearly              identified in simple limiting cases.  Developing a new methodology,             as these researchers propose, has the potential for major impact on             understanding all kinetic processes which can be described with                 equation.                                                                                                                                                       The project initiates formal cooperation between these scientists,              with long.standing mutual interests and professional relationships.             The research is a throughly joint effort involving the chemistry                background of Lovett and the physics expertise of Lekner, and this              collaboration is essential to the success of the project.  The                  research should add considerely to knowledge in basic mathematical              aspects of statistical mechanics, along with potential application to           a range of chemical and physical rate processes.",
