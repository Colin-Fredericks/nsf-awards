In order to generalize results and to develop a more                   comprehensive body of data in an important pressure range, it                   is proposed to determine, using a piston-cylinder apparatus,                    the phase relationships at 15, 25, and 30 kbar and the effect                   of Na2O on melting relationships.  The data would provide new                   constraints on (1) the origin of primary mid-ocean ridge                        basalts, (2) the composition, depth of generation, and                          percent melting of primary tholeiitic magmas in the Hawaiian                    Islands, and (3) the origin of high-alumina basalts in                          subduction zones.  In addition, it is proposed to study                         melting relations in the system Mg2SiO4-SiO2 up to pressures                    of 250 kbar using an MA-8 apparatus at the University of                        Alberta.  This study would bear on very high pressure                           magmatic processes in the early history of the earth.",
