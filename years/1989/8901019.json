 "awd_abstract_narration": "A REU that would focus on the preparation and properties of                     electronic materials is established.  Students would be involved                each year in both academic year and summer research projects in                 the areas of semiconductor materials, optical materials, and                    electronic ceramics.  The common focus of all the projects will                 be the development and understanding of materials with electrical               or optical properties that are important for applications.                      Specific research projects include:  (1) crystallization of                     amorphous ceramics, (2) infrared transmitting glass fibers, (3)                 mapping of epitaxial semiconductor materials, (4) synthesis and                 optical properties of doped sol-gel materials, (5) crystal growth               of high conductivity oxides, optically active dyes-in-ceramic                   composites, and characterization of conducting polymers.                        Students for the academic year part of the program will be                      selected from a variety of undergraduate programs, including                    materials science, electrical engineering and chemistry.  These                 students will receive academic year support for research                        activities and then be encouraged to continue as participants in                on-going projects during the summer.  Students for the summer                   part of the program will be recruited from a variety of high                    quality undergraduate institutions, such as Harvey Mudd and the                 Pomona Colleges, which are not able to provide a graduate-level                 research environment.  A summer seminar series will be conducted                in which students can present their work and interact                           professionally with graduate students and faculty in a research                 environment.  Several of the students will be selected each year                to present their work at national meetings.",
