 "awd_abstract_narration": "The archaeological site of Beidha, located in southern Jordan,                  was the focus of eight seasons of field research between 1958 and               1983.  The low tell covers an area of approximately 2935 square                 miles, and extensive excavations have uncovered almost this                     entire area.  Six main village levels have been identified and 70               structures examined.  Radiocarbon dates indicate an occupation                  during the 8th and 7th millennia B.C., and this Neolithic site                  documents the early stages of the transition to agriculture and                 herding in the Near East.                                                                                                                                       Under the sponsorship of Dr. Douglas Price, Dr. Brian Byrd will                 analyze Beidha data.  Dr. Byrd participated in the excavation and               has access to the archaeological notes, field plans, and                        artifacts.  He will continue to analyze these materials to                      examine changes in the organizational structure and nature of                   activity areas during the long occupation sequence.  Analysis                   will include the orientation and arrangement of buildings,                      circulation pathways, and building size features and contents.                  This data set will provide a unique opportunity to examine                      changes in community organization, in household configuration and               activities, and in production of specialization.                                                                                                                The Neolithic period in the Near East saw the rise of a social                  system which is characteristic of complex societies such as our                 own.  Through examination of this process, archaeologists can                   gain insight into how complex societies which characterize both                 developed and developing countries arise and are maintained.",
