 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mixing of highly viscous liquids and polymer melts is frequently            encountered in polymer processing operations and requires special               equipment such as motionless mixers and extruders of various                    designs,that subject the fluid to extensional and shear flows as well           as surface renewal.  Mixing may be an end in itself, as in polymer              blending or compounding.  Often mixing is an essential requirement for          other operations such as polymerization, devolatilization, polymer              grafting, or the dissolving of additives or solvents.                                                                                                           The development of new processes dependent on mixing of viscous                 polymer melts requires the selection of a type or class of equipment            to carry out the desired operation.  This in turn depends on an                 understanding of the fluid mechanics of the system.  This research              addresses the development and application of a method for measuring             the effectiveness of viscous mixing in practical mixing equipment               commonly used in polymer processing operations.  The method involves            estimating the degree of mixing by monitoring the product of a mass             transfer limited set of competitive second order chemical reactions.                                                                                            The specific experimental system will measure the product distribution          obtained from the reaction of p-phenylene diamine and phthalic                  anhydride when each of the reactants is dissolved (in low                       concentrations) in separate streams of molten polyethylene.  In   this          system, the product distribution depends on the manner in                       which the two streams are contacted and mixed. The results should               influence the selection, design, and operation of industrial                    equipment used for the mixing of viscous fluids.  It is                         anticipated that the results will, in additional, suggest                       directions and provide the means for developing new types of                    mixing devices or mixing elements based on a fundamental                        understanding of mixing mechanisms.                                                                                                                             This work will be done in a cooperative mode with industry under  the           Industry/University Cooperative Research Program.  Du Pont will supply          the funds to support a graduate student for two years, quantities of            polymers for the test program at the University of Delaware,                    analytical and test services at Du Pont, and the services of a very             competent co-PI to help supervise the graduate students doing this              research.  The project will thus benefit from two excellent                     researchers and the combined facilities of both the University of               Delaware and Du Pont.",
