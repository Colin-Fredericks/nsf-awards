 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a group project to investigate interdisciplinary                    aspects of problems relating to coordinating the activities of                  autonomous agents.  It researches a variety of issues arising in                computer science, electrical engineering, economics, and                        operations research.  Some of the problems are purely theoretical               and typically use techniques of discrete and combinatorial                      mathematics.  Some require computational experimentation.  And                  some of them model the practices and tasks of real organizations.               The problems have a common thread, and this project will develop                a precise common language, so that the work on one problem will                 have an impact on the others. In each problem, there is a group                 of processors/persons who are to perform a common task.  A                      designer is to chose a coordination scheme that specifies for                   each person/processor the computations and the communicating that               must be performed at each of a sequence of points of time.  The                 designeer wants the scheme to be efficient with respect to                      several cost measures.  The costs may include communication time,               computing capacity, distance from correct task fulfillment, and                 the capacity to control actions.  To make this research a group                 venture, a continuing seminar on coordination problems is                       conducted and advanced graduate students are involved.                             The project goal is to exploit the different techniques and                  perspectives of the disciplines involved to advance knowledge                   concerning the central problem of how to efficiently coordinate                 activities involving inputs, processes and decisions of several                 separate agents.",
