 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between leaf longevity and the physiology                 and secondary metabolite production among leaves varying in                     longevity is an area severely lacking in information.  This                     proposal, through various hypotheses and rigorous experimental                  designs, seeks to better understand these relationships and to                  provide baseline data about the interactions between leaf                       longevity, leaf physiology, and secondary metabolite production.                Information gained from this study will be useful in                            understanding how plants with leaves of varying longevity may                   defend these important photosynthetic tissues against herbivores                and pathogens.  Such information would be useful in theoretical                 considerations dealing with photosynthesis of crop and forest                   systems, and in describing how the polyphenolic defenses of plant               species in natural communities have evolved.  Furthermore,                      compounds or structures will be identified that may not be known                and may prove useful as natural insecticides.  For example, on                  the basis of preliminary data submitted in the original proposal,               none of the 15 known phenolic compounds for which we screened                   tissue were present in the plants from Panama.",
