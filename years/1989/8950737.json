 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mount Holyoke is upgrading its introductory physics labs by using new           technology in carefully chosen applications to enhance the educational          value of the lab.  They are using 12 microcomputers, a frame grabber,           A/D electronics, and software to use in new introductory lab                    applications.  These do not replace stopwatches and meter sticks with           high-tech equivalents:  students need to know and have confidence in            rough and ready methods of measurement.  The role for the new                   technology is to have students go where they could not go before:  (1)          acquire previously unattainable kinds of data, and (2) have access to           conceptual tools for visualization and thought experiments.  An                 essential part of the plan is the development of software which builds          on the social ambiance of the introductory lab:  real data from real            experiments, and discussions with lab partners and instructors.  The            computer will (1) talk to the outside world through instrument                  interfaces, (2) talk to clusters of users through graphics, and (3)             enable the kinds of manipulations students need to perform:  arithmetic         on data, graphing, fitting, varying of parameters, and visualizing.             All of this is being smoothly integrated, so that the graphics screen           becomes a focus for discussion, and new analyses or ideas can be tried          out with just a few keystrokes or mouse clicks.  The grantee provides           funds for this project that are an equal match for the NSF award.                                                                                               The University will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
