 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six major cone proteins of 40S hn RNP exist as three                            tetramers which bind pre-MRNA during transcription and                          package 700 nucleotide lengths of RNA into a repeating array                    of regular particles.  It is likely that this phenomenon play                   and important role in preventing heteroduplex formation                         during transcription and that it forces the numerous                            transcripts of active genes into a manageable conformation.                     Clearly the packaging mechanism must accommodate all RNA                        processing events.  Several lines of evidence demonstrate                       that the core proteins alone do not pass the necessary                          information to direct particle assembly at sequence specific                    sites in vitro, thus the reactive sites involved in splicing                    may not be packaged in hn RNP in the same way as the bulk of                    the RNA.  Attempts will be made to provide a topological view                   of RNA and proteins in monoparticles and to determine if                        mechanisms exist to phase the assembly of hn RNP in a                           splicing consistent manner.                                                                                                                                     A large number of ultrastructural and biochemical findings                      now argue convincingly that pre-MRNA is packaged during                         transcription into a repeating array of regular                                 ribonucleoproteins particles and there is considerable                          evidence that splice site recognition, spliceosome assembly,                    larial formation, excision  and legations all occur while RNA                   exists in a highly packaged state.  Recent work by Dr. Le                       Stourgeon now makes possible mechanistic understanding of RNA                   processing.//",
