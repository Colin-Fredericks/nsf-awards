 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will develop cell culture model systems to                study the consequences of regulation of the sodium- and                         potassium-activated ATPase, the sodium pump.  This enzyme is                    found in the plasma membrane of cells in all vertebrates and is                 evolutionarily related to cation transporting ATPases in lower                  eukaryotes and bacteria.  Regulation of the ATPase will be                      modeled by generating gene amplified cell lines that have a range               of expression of the sodium pump.  Amplification of the genes for               the sodium pump will be accomplished either by step-selection                   with ouabain or by transfection with minute chromosomes from C+,                a HeLa cell line expressing unstable resistance to ouabain.  The                sodium pump is responsible for the generation of the sodium                     electrochemical potential across the plasma membrane, as well as                the membrane potential.  Thus, regulation of this enzyme may have               profound consequences on the physiology of the organism.                        Evidence that such regulation may actually occur includes the                   remarkable evolutionary conservation of an inhibitory site on the               enzyme which has been proposed to be the target of some                         endogenous natriuretic factors.  Compounds which bind at this                   site include the important pharmacological probes for this                      activity, the alkaloids, digitalis and ouabain.                                                                                                                 This research should provide new information concerning the                     effect on cells of altered activity of the enzyme which \"pumps\"                 sodium out and potassium in, and which thus regulates the ionic                 composition of the cytoplasm, and contributes to the maintenance                of the physiologically important, electrical potential across                   cell membranes.  In addition, this research at an undergraduate                 institution will provide an opportunity for college students to                 participate in modern experiments in cell biology, and should                   stimulate their interest in research careers.",
