 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop models and                    algorithms for an integrative approach to manufacturing.  A                     guiding principle of this approach is that the design of the                    product and the production process are done concurrently, rather                than sequentially as in traditional approaches.                                      A major breakthrough in combinatorial optimization has been                the polyhedral combinatoric approach.  In this project, the                     principal investigator proposes to apply this new approach to                   manufacturing.  Many problems in product/production planning                    (e.g. facility layout, product classification, etc.) can be                     modeled as combinatorial optimization problems.  Researcher's                   will investigate the polyhedral structure of these problems,                    develop and evaluate cutting-plane methods that exploit this                    structure.  Model variations and adaptations of the cutting plane               algorithms will also be studied.                                                     This research will lead to a flexible and effective solution               methodology for a wide range of manufacturing design problems.                  The models and algorithms developed here may be used as part of                 the control system for an automated factory or as an                            intelligence module of a decision support system for                            manufacturing design.  The characterization of the polyhedral                   structure of these problems may also yield insights on the design               process, thus guiding the construction of an effective modeling                 framework for the integrative approach to manufacturing design.",
