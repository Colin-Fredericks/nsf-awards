This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support five projects in the                Department of Statistics at the University of Florida:                          Hierarchical Bayes Analysis of Growth Curve Models, directed by                 Malay Ghosh; Nonparametric Multivariate Statistical Methods Based               on Interdirections, directed by Ronald Randles; Data Compression                Using Block Time Series Modeling, directed by Mark Yang;                        Optimization in Response Surface Methodology, directed by Andre                 Khuri; and Statistical Properties of Projection Pursuit                         Clustering Algorithms, directed by Kenneth M.
