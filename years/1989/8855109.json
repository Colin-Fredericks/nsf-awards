 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summer science for girls in a two week residential summer science               enrichment program for girls entering the ninth grade.  The                     program will be conducted by The University of Michigan Women in                Science Program of the Center for the Continuing Education of                   Women in collaboration School of Natural Resources, the College                 of Engineering, and the UM Information Technology Division.                                                                                                     Students will select a focus project in one of three areas:                     chemistry, engineering or natural resources.  In the second year,               a forth focus project area in physics will be added.  Students                  will spend two hours each morning in a discussion group and two                 hours each afternoon in corresponding hands-on laboratory project               in their focus areas.  Students will be introduced to the                       concepts of the scientific research methodology during                          orientation and these concepts will be reinforced and expanded                  upon during the focus project sessions.  They will participate                  in a computer project daily involving a basic analog to digital                 converter used to gather data from a simple sensor and convert it               to numerical information more suitable for analysis.  After                     gathering data, students will use common graphics programs to                   graph the data.  Participants will be able to take the analog to                digital converter back to their school, install it in their                     science laboratories and instruct others in its use.  Students                  will also participate in a field biology trip, a mathematics                    program, and a field trip to a science and technology museum.                   Evening sessions will be devoted to career panels in chemistry,                 geology, science teaching, engineering, biology, mathematics                    and physics  Students will have an opportunity to talk with women               scientists in each area.",
