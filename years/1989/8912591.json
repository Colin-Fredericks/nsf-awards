The purpose is to                                   assess the current status of the field of                                       wind engineering research and applications,                                     and to develop recommendations for future                                       activities.  The panel will deliberate on                                       issues related to research performed during                                     the past two decades; the interaction between                                   diverse disciplines, e.g., meteorology,                                         structural engineers, designers, economists                                     and others; undergraduate and graduate                                          education in wind engineering; and                                              international wind engineering research                                         activities among other concerns.  A report                                      will be produced and disseminated throughout                                    private and public organizations and                                            professional groups specializing in wind                                        engineering.",
