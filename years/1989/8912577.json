Under this grant, an eight-member planning                        committee, co-chaired by Professor Frederic L. Holmes of Yale                   University and Professor Bruce Sinclair of Georgia Institute of                 Technology will organize a \"Critical Problems Conference\" devoted               to examining the principal problems, research frontiers, and                    areas of opportunity for research, applications and teaching in                 the history of science and technology.  Professor Holmes and                    Professor Sinclair are, respectively, former presidents of HSS                  and SHOT.  The conference will be held in conjunction with the                  1991 joint meeting of the two societies scheduled for Madison,                  Wisconsin.  The sessions will address issues organized around                   five categories of topics:  subjects (physics, transportation,                  biology, manufacturing, etc.), periods (early modern, 19th,                     20th), methodologies (internalist, contextual, etc.),                           historiography, and applications.  The goals of this study will                 mesh with and be reinforced by a coordinate demographic study of                the practitioners of the two fields.",
