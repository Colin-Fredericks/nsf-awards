The investigations of                                      biospheric/atmospheric interactions will focus on the cycle of                  photochemical oxidants in the atmosphere.  Using the resistance                 formulation to simulate the mass transfer and deposition of                     atmospheric oxidants (eg., O3, H2O2) to mesophyllic leaf cells,                 this research will attempt to identify the key chemical and                     physical processes which control the rate of removal of                         atmospheric oxidants by dry deposition as well as the degree of                 sensitivity of a plant to damage from the deposition of these                   atmospheric oxidants.  In a related study  a one-dimensional                    photochemical model will be used to study the role of biogenic                  emissions of hydrocarbons in controlling the levels of                          atmospheric oxidants in pristine and polluted continental                       environments.  The investigations relating to the hydrological                  cycle will focus on the processes which control the removal and                 chemical conversion of soluble trace species by clouds and the                  development of algorithms to simulate these processes in three-                 dimensional, chemical transport models of the global                            troposphere.",
