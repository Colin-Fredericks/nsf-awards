 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems of packing a set of objects into a finite container and         of covering some space by a set of objects are known to be hard (NP-            complete) computational problems.  Geometric versions of these problems         have many applications in areas such a stock cutting in computer-aided          manufacturing and object recognition by templates in computer vision.           The research is directed towards tractable, yet interesting                     formulations of these problems by considering the internal density of           the packing or covering, that is by determining the best way of                 arranging objects in an infinite space, ignoring boundaries.                       In the area of path planning it will be investigated how the                 configuration of a set of obstacles in the plane affects the structure          of shortest paths that avoid the obstacles.  The research is                    particularly concerned with the conditions under which the shortest             path between two points is monotonic, that is, it does not reverse              direction relative to the line segment joining its start and goal               points.  Monotonic shortest paths are of interest, because (1) shortest         paths can be found efficiently if they are known to be monotonic, and           (2) many applications of path planning involve shortest path queries            that are monotonic.",
