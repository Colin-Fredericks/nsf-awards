 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a statistical-mechanical                theory of phase transitions in ferroelectric random copolymers,                 and to apply this theory to the copolymer of vinylidene fluoride                with trifluoroethylene.  This material is of particular interest                because it exhibits a reversible transition between ferroelectric               and paraelectric phases.  The methods to be employed involve the                combination of the transfer-integral approach that has been                     successfully used to study ferroelectric homopolymers and the                   Schmidt functional-equation method.  This latter technique was                  originally developed to treat the electronic density of states in               metallic alloys, but now shows promise as a powerful tool in the                study of polymers.  The significance of the proposed research                   lies in the fact that comparatively little detailed work has                    previously been performed on the theory of crystalline polymers                 exhibiting both conformational and configurational disorder.  A                 successful outcome of this research project would open the door                 to the theoretical study of a wide range of copolymeric                         materials.",
