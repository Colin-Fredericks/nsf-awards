 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to test whether central or multiple supply is                 dominant (e.g., as a function of spreading rate, or regionally                  at the same spreading rate), by carrying out a laboratory                       petrologic and geochemical study of closely-spaced (7 km)                       samples from a well-mapped 100 km-long segment of the slow                      spreading (35-40 mm/yr) Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) at 26 degrees                  S.  The 26 degrees S segment is ideal for such a test because                   of its simple along-axis morphology (typical of many MAR                        segments), the absence of hot spot influence, the existence of                  dense Seabeam, gravity, and magnetic data, and the availability                 of closely-spaced axial basalt samples an samples from nearby                   seamounts, Preliminary chemical data for the samples show                       remarkably regular and systematic patterns of along-axis                        chemical variations, indication that continued, more detailed                   petrologic and chemical studies are justified.                                  %%%                                                                                                                                                             Process that supply basalt melt to active mid-ocean ridges are                  of current interest because melt supply dynamics play a key                     role in the formation of oceanic crust.  Dr. Batiza possesses                   an important set of closely spaced samples at a slow spreading                  ridge axis.  The results will improve our understanding of                      magma supply dynamics at a slow spreading ridge, and the data                   will be useful for comparison with similar data sets for fast-                  spreading ridges.",
