 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last decade statistical data inference have played an                  important role in establishing the basic facts used for public                  policy, e.g. estimating the prevalence of HIV infection,                        determining the risk of cancer from occupational or environmental               exposures, and in the legal setting, e.g. cases concerning                      employment discrimination.  The purpose of this project is to                   study statistical problems arising in these contexts and to                     develop appropriate statistical methodologies for their solution.               Research on procedures for estimating the prevalence of rare                    diseases which preserve anonymity by combining individual samples               into batches prior to testing is a major goal.  These methods                   should enable health specialists to obtain the cooperation of the               public as infected individuals and non-infected persons who are                 misclassified (false positive) will not be identified.  Robust                  methods which led to statistically valid inferences when several                scientifically plausible models may underlie the data or when a                 few observations may be erroneous will continue to emphasized.                  In addition, statistical methods continue to play a role in the                 analysis of pay, promotion and hiring data in employment                        discrimination cases.  In particular, alternative regression                    approaches will be analyzed that were used by parties in the                    Watson v. Fort Worth Bank case.",
