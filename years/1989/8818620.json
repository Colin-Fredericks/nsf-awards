 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cytokin are a group of plant hormones which play an important role              in cell division and differentiation.  The mechanisms controlling               the appropriate levels of cytokinins in plants are poorly understood.           The long term goal of the research project is to identify                       regulatory elements controlling cytokinin metabolism in the genus               Phaseolus. Recent findings led to the discovery of genetic differences          in cytokinin metabolism in Phaseolus embryos, identification of                 novel zeatin metabolites and isolation of three cytokinin specific              enzymes. As the activities of these enzymes are species specific and            the resulting metabolites display higher biological activity than               the parent compound, selective expression of key metabolic enzymes may          be a significant mechanism of regulating active cytokinin levels.               To elucidate the metabolic control mechanisms, we propose                       to further characterize the enzymes, to generate mononclonal                    anti bodies for detection of enzyme activity at different developmental         stages and to conduct molecular analyses of the regulation and                  expression of these enzymes.  The proposed work is important to the             formulation of a working model governing the overall controls of                hormone metabolism in higher plants.                                                                                                                            Cytokinins are a group of hormones which regulate plant growth                  and cell division.  The proposal work is designed to isolate                    and identify aspects of these plant hormones and their functioning              to better understand plant growth.",
