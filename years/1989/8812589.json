 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of SPECMAP, a research program begun                in 1979.  The general goal of SPECMAP is to advance our                         understanding of climate dynamics on orbital time scales (10,000                to 100,000 years). Over this frequency band, major changes in the               global climate system are externally forced by modulations in                   the annual cycle of incoming radiation.                                              This phase of SPECMAP research includes a major shift toward               an experimental program in which the existing SPECMAP database                  augmented by crucial new observations, is assimilated into a                    series of numerical experiments.  These experiments will be                     conducted around three themes:  the tropical ocean, high-                       latitude processes, and the ocean carbon system.                                     This research is important because it provides a rare                      opportunity  (one for which the forcing is known with great                     precision) to conduct quantitative investigations of the                        mechanisms of climate change.  The specific goal is to understand               the physical and chemical mechanisms by which the ocean, coupled                to the atmosphere and cryosphere, mediates the climatic response                of the earth to orbital forcing by altering the fluxes of heat,                 salt, and carbon.",
