 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed towards a wider understanding of                       resolved fluorescence spectroscopy as applied to proteins and                   towards answering specific questions about the heme proteins,                   cytochrome c and horse-radish peroxidase.  Using the                            conditions of site selection fluorescence, line-narrowed                        emission spectra can be obtained from iron-free or metal-                       substituted derivatives of these heme proteins.  Specific                       emphasis will be placed on the role of the protein in                           stabilizing deformations of the porphyrin induced by Jahn-                      Teller instability.  The distribution of protein substates will                 also be studied.                                                                                                                                                Evidence that proteins undergo considerable intramolecular                      motion comes from a variety of experimental observations which                  have been interpreted in terms of conformational                                fluctuations of the polypeptide chain.  In addition to                          structural substates, there may be \"chemical\" substates                         arising because proteins are polyelectrolytes.  Whether the                     origin of the substates is structural or chemical, each                         substate will have unique physical and chemical properties.                     The use of fluorescence line narrowing spectroscopy will                        enable the characterization of the substates in heme                            proteins.",
