Stanley of Louisiana State University will study the                  synthesis and chemical reactivity of binucleating polytertiary-                 phosphines and their coordination compounds in this research                    within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry                 Program. These coordination compounds will be examined with                     respect to their catalytic behavior on the hydroformylation                     reaction with alkenes to produce aldehydes and subsequently                     primary alcohols, both of which are commercially important                      classes of organic compounds.                                                                                                                                   Bis\u0131phenyl(2-diethylphosphinoethyl)phosphino!methane, a tetra-                  tertiary phosphine which forms bimetallic complexes with the                    metals in close proximity (closed-mode or \"cradle\" complexes),                  and some tetraphosphine analogues, will be used as the ligands                  of choice for this study. The unique property of this set of                    ligands to form the cradle complexes, instead of the open-mode                  usually observed with previously examined polyphosphines, allows                the study of metal cooperativity in this series of catalysts.                   Reactions to be studied include double hydroformylation of                      conjugated dienes (e.g., butadiene), asymmetric                                 hydro-formylation of prochiral alkenes, and carbon-carbon bond                  formation in alkene and alkyne cyclizations and                                 oligomerizations.",
