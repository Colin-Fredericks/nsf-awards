The Maine Maritime Academy,                     on behalf of a consortium of Maine research and educational                     institutions, was awarded a Charter Party Agreement in 1988                     to operate the NSF-owned research vessel ARGO MAINE (formerly                   R/V CAYUSE).  The Academy will acquire a shore-based sideband                   communications radio and will upgrade and make operational a                    CTD / Rosette system that has been donated to the Academy by                    a private company.  The CTD collects information on seawater                    conductivity and temperature as it is lowered through the                       water column.  The Rosette system collects discrete water                       samples from specific depths for later analysis.  Both are                      very basic pieces of seagoing equipment and are widely used                     by oceanographic institutions.  The requested upgrades will                     bring the systems up to modern scientific specifications.                       The equipment will be used on the ship for the Academy's                        educational programs and for research projects of Consortium                    members and visiting investigators.",
