 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Sociology at St. Olaf College is equipping               a microcomputer laboratory, that will be used to enhance the                    existing two-semester research methods sequence (Sociology 71 and               72) and to introduce techniques of data analysis to entry level                 students.  The equipment gives students hands-on experience in                  analyzing existing survey data from the National Opinion Research               Center and allows them to do statistical analyses of data from                  their own research projects.  Although the current research                     methods courses have been in place for twelve years, the lack of                equipment has hampered our ability to offer students the                        necessary first-hand exposure to data analysis using rapidly                    developing microcomputer software technologies.  The added                      instrumentation enhances curriculum by allowing:  (1) in-class                  demonstrations of data manipulation and analysis;  (2)                          assignments based on the analysis of survey data; and  (3)                      assigned lab-periods where students work under direct faculty                   supervision.  The following equipment is being added to the                     microcomputer lab:  7 Epson Equity II+ PC-AT compatibles with 40                MB internal hard disk drives and EGA Color Monitors, 1 Hewlett-                 Packard Laser Jet, 1 Data Display, 7 copies of SPSS/PC+, and 1                  copy of Showcase.                                                                                                                                                    The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal                    amount of funds.",
