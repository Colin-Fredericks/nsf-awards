Feinman and Abramson are continuing and expanding their                    elegant studies of the biological processes underlying learning                 and memory.  Their approach is to use an animal with a relatively               simple nervous system, and, to study the simplest types of                      associative learning.  The choice of learning model is the eye                  withdrawal reflex of the green crab:  Eyes are drawn back into                  the shell in response to almost all strong stimuli.  Like                       protective reflexes in higher organisms, it can be modified by                  experience.  Even these animals with primitive nervous systems                  can be taught to respond to a previously neutral stimulus by                    associating it with a strong stimulus that elicits the response.                This association of stimuli, or Pavlovian conditioning, is one of               the most fundamental processes in animal learning.                                                                                                              The relatively simple organization of the nervous system makes it               possible to investigate the role of neurotransmitters (chemical                 communicators between nerve cells) in terms of their relation to                behavior and the organization of the nervous system.  The                       similarities an differences between learning in simple                          invertebrates and in higher animals can yield important insights                into the molecular, cellular and organismal processes which                     underlie learning.",
