 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to design a study to examine sociocultural and                 biological factors associated with the transmission of AIDS in Western          Africa.                                                                                                                                                         During the planning period the following are expected to be                     fulfilled:                                                                        1. Selection of hospital(s) in the Ivory Coast or Gambia; the                   highest incidences of HIV-2 seropositivity have been reported in                these countries.                                                                2. Establish research ties with an academic department or research              organization in the selected country.                                           3. Obtain from hospital administrators consent to participate; and              permission to review patient charts to gather information on                    infection rate and duration.                                                    4. Establish working relations with local administrators, physicians            and nurses.                                                                     5. Determine sample design to                                                        a) obtain a population of African and Caucasian HIV                             seropositives and seronegatives                                                 b) insure a sample of high risk individuals                                     c) plan a strategy to contact and receive participants at                       designated locations                                                       6. Determine the best storage and transportation method for blood               samples and identify legal requirements for transporting blood                  samples containing HIV across country boundaries, if necessary.                 7. Select blood groups and serum proteins to be identified in the               blood analysis; and identify laboratory to conduct blood analysis               and determine cost of analysis.                                                 8. Develop demographic, cultural and health belief instrumentations.            9. Prepare a research proposal to examine bicultural factors                    influencing the transmission of AIDS in Western Africa which will be            submitted to the National Science Foundation.",
