 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to establish an REU Site at San Diego                 State University which will provide undergraduate student                       research experience in the laboratories of a strong group of                    molecular biologists who are faculty members of the Departments                 of Biology and Chemistry and who interact professionally as                     members of the College's Molecular Biology Institute (MBI).                     Nineteen of the 22 MBI members have expressed interest in                       supervising approximately 30 undergraduate student in research                  activities in their laboratories.  Both plant and animal science                areas are represented in their research interests, and the                      molecular approaches applied to their research problems represent               the latest technologies.  Eighteen of the 22 members currently                  receive extra-mural funding, which is indicative of the quality                 of the science performed in their laboratories.                                                                                                                 Student participation will be limited to 8 students, to ensure                  the quality of the recruitment process.  The majority of                        students, after a laboratory assignment is made, will participate               in that laboratory's research program for one academic year and                 the following summer.  Participation will involve a minimum of 10               hrs./week during the academic year and 40 hrs./week for eight                   weeks in the summer.  Students will participate in weekly                       laboratory meetings and will progress as quickly as possible to                 independent project status.  They will also attend the weekly MBI               seminar, which features nationally and internationally known                    scientists in fields of molecular biology.                                                                                                                      The primary objective of this project is the encouragement and                  preparation of students to enter advanced, especially doctoral,                 degree programs in the sciences.  Working with a highly competent               research scientist for an extended period of time will permit the               development of the student's personal research skills and                       understanding of the research process.  This excellent                          preparation should encourage students to apply, and make them                   highly competitive, for openings in a variety of advanced degree                programs.",
