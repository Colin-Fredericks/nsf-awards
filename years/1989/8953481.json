 "awd_abstract_narration": "These Engineering Foundation Conferences, to be held annually, are a            response to the need for forums for interaction and exchange about              innovation in undergraduate engineering education.  Each of the                 conferences will bring engineering educators together to exchange               ideas, problems and solutions about engineering education and is                expected to stimulate more and better innovation.  A proceedings of             each conference will be published and given broad distribution within           the engineering education community.  The format for planning and               holding the conference is designed to encourage presentation and                discussion of recent developments to reduce the time required to                include new ideas in undergraduate offerings.  The grantee and the              institutions of the conference participants are expected to provide             support for the conferences that is several times the funds requested           from NSF for this project.",
