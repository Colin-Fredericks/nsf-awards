This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support five research                       projects in the Department of Statistics at the University of                   Wisconsin-Madison: Interactive Display of Likelihood and Response               Surfaces, directed by Douglas Bates; Optimal Smoothing in                       Nonparametric Quantile Regression and Related Sensitivity                       Analysis, directed by Probal Chaudhuri; Tree-Structured Inference               and Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals, directed by Wei-Yin Loh;                 Analysis of Reduced Rank Models for Multiple Time-Series,                       directed by Gregory Reinsel; and Graphical Summaries of Spatial                 Processes, directed by Brian Yandell.",
