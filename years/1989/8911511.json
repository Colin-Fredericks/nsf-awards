 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economists have long recognized the important role for                          inventories in explaining business cycles.  Abramovits, for                     example,  argued in 1950 that inventories were a key factor for                 U.S. business cycles.  A little later Mathews emphasized that                   business cycle turning points,  especially downturns,  are to a                 large extent accounted for by changes in inventory investment.                  Recently,  this has been documented for the U.S. with up-to-date                statistics,  by Blinder in 1981 and Blinder and Holtz-Eakin in                  1986.  In an atheoretical accounting sense,  over half the peak                 to trough fall in GNP in post-1929 U.S. recessions has typically                been attributable to changes in inventory investment.  No general               agreement exists,  however,  as to why inventory investment is so               pro-cyclical.                                                                                                                                                   This provides the motivation for the present research which seeks               to integrate models of inventory behavior with theories of the                  business cycle.  The role of inventories in business cycles will                be evaluated using data from seven industrialized countries -                   Canada,  France,  West Germany,  Italy,  Japan,  the U.K.  and                  the U.S. -  emphasizing the countries for which the data are best               -  Canada,  Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.  The research will first               consider how representative is the well-documented U.S.                         experience on the behavior of inventories over the cycle.  It                   will then estimate structural inventory models,  for aggregate                  economies as well as for two-digit manufacturing.                                                                                                               Broadening the data used for inventory analysis to include those                from countries other than the U.S. seems likely to help us                      discern general patterns,  increase our power to discriminate                   between otherwise indistinguishable hypotheses,  and sharpen our                estimates of key parameters.The results should be of interest to                a wide audience,  not only \"inventory\" specialists.",
