 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the Image Processing Center at the            University of New Mexico.  A previous NSF award provided funds for the          purchase of equipment that was used to set up the center.  These funds          will provide partial support of staff salaries.  Additional support             will be obtained from institutional funds and user fees.  The facility          serves a large and growing number of faculty who have need of image             processing as part of their research programs.  The center consists of          three laboratories, one general purpose for the digital analysis of             gels, photographs and other visual materials, one for quantitative              fluorescence microscopy, and one for electron microscopy.                           Over the last twenty years, image processing has developed from a           relatively crude and cumbersome technique suitable for only a few uses          in astronomy, in the space program and in very sophisticated electron           microscopy.  Image processing is now a basic tool with significant              impact on a variety of microscopic and other techniques in biology,             biophysics, biochemistry and other areas of research.  Despite their            widespread acceptance, image processing techniques still demand                 relatively sophisticated understanding of computation to be of maximum          benefit to their users.  When coupled with the expense of the                   computational tools required, this means that image processing is often         beyond the intellectual and financial means of investigators who might          benefit from its use, but for whose research programs it is not                 absolutely essential.  The existence of central facilities funded               through a mixture of institutional funds, user fees and, where                  appropriate, direct grants provides a solution to this difficult                situation.  Though only a few years old, this facility is already well          on the way to establishing itself as an important ingredient of                 numerous research programs at the University of New Mexico.",
