 "awd_abstract_narration": "A center for the development of new instrumentation and the                     facilitation of its application for biological research has been                established.  Its objective is to provide for the systematic                    invention and development of improved electro-optical microscopic               imaging quantitation technologies, and to facilitate the                        application of these new physical instrumentation capabilities                  through collaborative research in molecular cell biology.  The                  needs of biological research push relentlessly at instrumental                  limitations even as they advance.  The molecular dynamics of                    vital processes in living cells can be revealed and measured by                 appropriate electro-optical microscopic image acquisition, photon               counting quantitation of weak molecular fluorescence, and                       computerized digital image processing with spatial and temporal                 transform analysis.  The Center will aim to optimize                            instrumentation capability for quantitation of receptor dynamics,               cell motion, structural fluctuations, spatial evolution of                      calcium ion activity, membrane potential, pH and receptor                       distributions, and molecular motions of individual fluorescence                 micro-image acquisition at faint light levels (photon counting)                 and fast (millisecond) acquisition of brighter transient images                 with efficient digital image processing, time resolved                          fluorescence imaging, utilization of chemical indicators, 3D                    image construction, quantitative confocal microscopy, image                     processing and laser interference imaging.  Collaborative                       interdisciplinary research to be accommodated by the center                     provides for new cell biology research and focuses the                          instrumentation developments on practicable technologies that can               be adopted by other laboratories.",
