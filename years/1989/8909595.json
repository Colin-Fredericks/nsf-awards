 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by ten                        Indian scientists in the 16th International Conference on                       the Physics of Electronic and Atomic Collisions (ICPEAC) to                     be held in New York City July 26-August 1, 1989.  The                           Co-chairmen of the local committee are Drs. M. S. Lubell                        (CUNY City College), T. B. Lucatorto (NIST) and N. H. Tolk                      (Vanderbilt University).  The conference focus is on                            interactions involving ions, atoms, simple molecules,                           electrons, positrons and photons.  In addition, topics in                       plasma and swarm phenomena, spectroscopy, surface physics,                      and the processes involving the structure of the nucleus                        are included as advances in those fields relate to the main                     areas of the conference.  In addition to the standard                           scientific program, there will be a short session on                            International Science to be held at the United Nations.                         The Indian participants will be selected, from over 30                          scientists who have submitted papers for the conference, by                     an Indian selection committee along with the U.S.                               organizers.                                                                                                                                                     Scope:  The physics of electronic and atomic collision is                       important to Indian science since it does not require large                     costly installations such as particle accelerators.  Thus,                      Indian scientists have been active in the field and their                       participation will be beneficial to the conference and                          certainly very helpful to them through the direct contact                       with scientists from other countries.",
