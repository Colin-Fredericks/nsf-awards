 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microtubules are required for chromosome motion and directed cell               locomotion.  Recent experiments had demonstrated that microtubules are          dynamic polymers and that dynamic behavior is modulated throughout the          cell cycle.  A major aim of these experiments is to quantitate                  microtubule dynamic behavior throughout the cell cycle and to examine           the function and regulation of microtubule dynamics.  To address these          questions, fluorescent or biotinylated derivatives of tubulin will be           microinjected into living cells and the rate and pattern of microtubule         turnover examined using fluorescence or electron microscopy.                    Microtubule dynamic behavior will be examined in interphase and                 correlated with cell motility.  The dramatic reorganization of the              interphase microtubule array at the transition from interphase to               mitosis will be examined in living cells.  Spindle fiber formation              during prometaphase will be characterized; particular attention will be         paid to the interaction of the kinetochore with spindle microtubules.           Does capture and release of microtubules within the kinetochore fiber           occur during prometaphase?  The half-time of kinetochore-microtubule            interactions will be measured to determine if the affinity of                   microtubules for the kinetochore changes during mitosis.  Finally,              experiments will be initiated to identify regulatory molecules involved         in modulation of microtubule dynamics in living cells.  The results of          this, research will provide significant new insight into the mechanisms         of cell motility and mitosis.",
