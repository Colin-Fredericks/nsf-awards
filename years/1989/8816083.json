 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor D. James Morre of Purdue University to            collaborate in research with Drs. Herbert Spring and Michael                    Trendenlenburg of the German Cancer Institute in Heidelberg.  They              plan to test the current concepts of how the sodium-selective                   ionophore monensin exerts its action in specifically blocking Golgi             apparatus function in plant and animal cells.  It is well accepted              that electron micrographs of monensin-treated cells display enlarged,           disarrayed Golgi cisternae.  However, there is evidence that these              effects may be dependent on how the cells were fixed for electron               microscopy.  Through collaboration, they will use a combination of              state-of-the-art light and electron microscopic approaches to observe           monensin-induced swelling of Golgi apparatus in living cells.  High             pressure freeze substitution will be employed to compare images                 generated by this technique for transmission electron microscopy with           images observed with conventional freeze substitution electron                  microscopy.  Dr. Morre was among the first to use monensin in studies           of Golgi apparatus structure and function.  The German                          co-investigators have pioneered in the development of the                       video-enhanced viewing methods and sample chamber design needed for             the planned experiments.  In addition, they expect to explore the use           of a laser-scanning confocal microscope, in collaboration with Dr. E.           Schnepf of Heidelberg, one of its developers.                                                                                                                   Monensin is a sodium ionophore capable of collapsing sodium and                 hydrogen gradients.  It has gained wide acceptance as a biochemical             and biological investigative tool to study Golgi apparatus function             and to identify the molecular pathways of subcellular vesicular                 traffic.  An entire hypothesis of how monensin works in the living              cell is based upon the assumption that trans Golgi apparatus                    cisternae swell following monensin treatment.  Swelling has been                observed in a wide range of plant and animal cells treated with                 monensin and prepared for electron microscopy using aldehyde                    fixatives.  However, morphological evidence of swelling is less or              nonexistent with other fixatives.  The proposed research will                   critically evaluate the overall validity of the monensin-swelling               hypothesis by determining unequivocally whether Golgi apparatus in              the living cell respond to monensin by swelling.  The collaborative             plan also offers an opportunity to test the uses of a German laser              scan confocal microscope, a very new, conceptually exciting and                 prohibitively expensive tool in the field of cell biology.  The                 confocal scanner may well be able to  achieve the resolving power               necessary to answer the questions posed in the current project.  If             so, it will be an important pioneering achievement in cell biology,             with significance for a broad variety of questions involving                    intracellular membranes.",
