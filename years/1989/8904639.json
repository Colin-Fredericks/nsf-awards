 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Janet Lanza, of the Biology Department at the State                         University of New York's Fredonia campus, will spend the 13-month               tenure of her Mid-Career Fellowship in Environmental Biology at                 the University of Texas at Austin, in Dr. Lawrence E. Gilbert's                 laboratory, with field studies to be conducted at Costa Rica's                  Corcovado National Park.  Her attention will be focused on                      measuring variation (both within and among species) in amino acid               levels in the extrafloral nectars of nine sympatric Passiflora                  (passion flower) species, and documenting the extent to which                   this resource enhances defense by ants in protecting the plant                  against insect herbivores such as Heliconius (butterfly)                        caterpillars.                                                                                                                                                   This research will increase our understanding of ant-plant                      mutualistic interactions and may serve as the basis for future                  studies of the genetic control of nectar composition and the                    effects of environmental variability on nectar composition.                     Ultimately, results could lead to improved agricultural and                     horticultural practices by providing a natural example of plant                 protection by biological means.  The work will also provide                     information about fundamental ecological processes in the                       tropics.",
