 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines the ways in which families change in                     response to large scale social changes.  The investigator                       will draw on data from U.S. census schedules between 1850 and                   1900 to chart the consequences, for families, of the                            transformation of the Los Angeles, California environment                       from a small, isolated, domestic economy in 1850 to a major                     urban center in 1900.  By examining relationships between                       gender, generation, and class position, on the one hand, and                    household composition, education, and employment, on the                        other, the investigator can test a theoretical model of how                     families meet their responsibilities under conditions of                        major economic upheaval.   The census data for Los Angeles in                   the late 19th century provide a strategic entry point in                        which to link family change with large-scale social change.                     This study will test existing assumptions about family                          strategies, that is, the choices families make as to which                      family members should work as well as decisions about who                       should go to school, marry, have children. This research is                     important because it investigates the manner in which the                       larger economy affects the range of alternatives from which                     families and individuals make their choices. By viewing                         family decisions as a consequence of the interplay between                      social structure and individual choice, this research can                       contribute to our understanding of family life and how it has                   been transformed in the United States.",
