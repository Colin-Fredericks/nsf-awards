S., Japan, and China delegations           agreed to establish Advisory Committees in each of the three countries          to plan ways to work together in exploring various aspects of physics           education.  This project will allow representatives of those committees         to meet in Hawaii in the summer of 1989 to explore ways to interact on          such topics as the role of women in physics, the education of physics           teachers, the physics curriculum, development of low cost experiments,          computer applications in physics education, research in concept                 formation by physics students, and the relation between physics                 education and languages.  The meeting will be followed by planning and          implementation of concrete activities in each country under the guidance        of the respective Advisory Committees.",
