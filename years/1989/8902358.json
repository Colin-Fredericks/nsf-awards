 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Second Symposium on Genetic Engineering in Animals will focus on            genes that have been cloned and the transgenic cattle, sheep, swine,            chickens, fish and laboratory animals that have been produced by                manipulation of these genes.  The major objectives of the symposium are:        1) to assess progress and identify the problems associated with the             production of transgenic animals; 2) to assess new developments in gene         delivery systems and gene expression; 3) to examine the modifications in        animal products (milk, meat, eggs) produced by genetic engineering              techniques; and 4) to assess progress on improving disease resistance by        genetic engineering.                                                                                                                                            Since there has been a lot of work on transgenic systems in the last            few years this is an appropriate time to hold this meeting.  It should          be very valuable for workers in the field to compare their progress and         assess future applications.",
