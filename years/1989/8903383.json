 "awd_abstract_narration": "The planned research falls roughly into two categories.  The                    first will utilize junction capacitance and ESR spectroscopy to                 study defect properties in various kinds of amorphous samples.                  First, they will extend their recent very successful studies of                 single heterojunction c-Si/a-Si:H structures to investigate                     contamination effects at the interface, and also to                             heterostructures of a-Si,Ge:H alloy layers on crystalline                       substrates.  They thus hope to identify trends in the interface                 defect structure and in band offsets.  They will continue their                 work with doping superlattice samples and also to initiate                      studies of heterostructure multilayer films.  They also wish to                 characterize the deep defect structure of bulk a-Si,Ge:H alloy                  films using their techniques.  The second area will be to study                 transport behavior using time and spatially modulated                           photoconductivity measurements.  Through some relatively new                    techniques they hope to better resolve the dispersive vs. non-                  dispersive components of the free carrier dynamics.  They also                  wish to apply the acphotocurrent phase shift analysis method in                 conjunction with their other experimental techniques to                         correlate, within the same samples, the deep defect distribution                above and below Ef.  This will provide a more critical test of                  the current defect models.",
