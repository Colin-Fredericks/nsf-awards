 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aims Community College has upgraded its chemical                           instrumentation with the purchase of a High Performance Liquid                  Chromatograph, a Gas Chromatograph, an Atomic Absorption                        Spectrometer, and a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer.               Through this purchase three important goals were achieved.                      First, the Chemical Testing Technology Program is enhanced.                     Training on modern equipment facilitate the student's entry in                  technically intensive jobs in local industry upon graduation.                   Second, chemical instrumentation is integrated into undergraduate               courses to demonstrate scientific concepts.  Student laboratory                 experiments have been developed for general college chemistry,                  organic chemistry, human biochemistry, and selected biological                  science courses A special set of laboratory experiments have been               developed for police academy trainees on the scientific basis of                analytical techniques in criminalistics.  Third, the experiments                that have been developed will be shared with others who teach                   undergraduate courses through publications and presentations.",
