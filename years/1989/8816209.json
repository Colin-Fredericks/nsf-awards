The question that is unanswered is \"Do any               of these currently forming stars acquire planetary systems                      similar to our own?\"  The question is unanswered because up to                  now observers lacked the angular resolution to detect planets or                planetary precursor object across interstellar distances. The                   Principal Investigator proposes to overcome this difficulty by                  using lunar occultations of star forming regions, which he thinks               will increase the angular resolution sufficiently to allow him to               observe planetary systems in the making.",
