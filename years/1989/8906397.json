 "awd_abstract_narration": "Naphthalene degradation is an excellent model system for                   studying the relationship of bacterial function, naphthalene                    degradation, to bacterial community structure and gene exchange                 in the environment.  Naphthalene-degrading bacteria are                         taxonomically diverse and the catabolic pathways for naphthalene                are often encoded on plasmids.  In a preliminary experiment, the                initial genes of the Pseudomonas putida pathway for naphthalene                 degradation, nahAB, were used to probe the DNA of naphthalene                   degrading bacteria isolated from sediments and soils.  Most of                  the soil isolates, about 50% of the freshwater isolates, but only               10% of the estuarine isolates displayed homology with the nahAB                 probe under highly stringent conditions for hybridization.  The                 results indicate that gene exchange among naphthalene-degraders                 may be habitat-specific.  The objectives of the proposed                        investigation are to collect and classify naphthalene-degrading                 bacteria from diverse environments, to determine the extent of                  homology between nahAB and the DNA of the degraders, and to                     analyze the relationship among nahAB homology, phenotypic-                      relatedness of the naphthalene degraders, and habitat                           distribution.  First, a large collection of naphthalene degraders               will be established by using a relatively nonselective isolation                technique and by obtaining strains from existing cultures.                      Naphthalene-degraders will be classified by a numerical taxonomy                approach.  Degraders will be screened for plasmids and their                    degree of homology with the nahAB DNA probe will be determined by               a semi-quantitative slot blot method.  Field and laboratory data                will be coded, stored in a mainframe computer, and analyzed for                 possible relationships by multivariate statistical methods.  The                study will yield baseline information on the ecology of                         naphthalene degraders and the extent of genetic exchange among                  bacteria of biogeochemical importance in the natural environment.",
