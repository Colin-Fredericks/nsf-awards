 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight work stations, four computer-aided modeling machines, and                 supporting software are provided for a computer-aided drafting                  and manufacturing laboratory.  This laboratory will offer a                     relatively inexpensive facility to give students hands-on                       experience in computer- aided manufacturing.  The facility will                 be used in two contact classes in mechanical engineering and will               support several others on student projects.  One of the two                     contact classes will be required of all students in mechanical                  engineering to give them an introduction to CAM.  The equipment                 proposed will be such that each student will be required to                     design (on a workstation) a simple part, development the NC                     information, and then machine the part in wax on the                            computer-aided modeling machines.  In an elective course on                     CAD/CAM, the students will be given much more extensive projects.               In a project course on the design of experiments, the equipment                 will be made available for the design and fabrication of small                  parts required in various experiments.  The CAD part of the                     facility will also be used by students in a senior design project               course and in a senior/graduate student elective course on                      computer aided design.  A low-end workstation approach is taken                 for the facility because of the low cost involved and because                   more and more of the students who graduate from mechanical                      engineering will be using this type of facility rather than large               CAD/CAM facilities based on expensive mainframes.",
