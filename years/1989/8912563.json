 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will permit the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to manage         activities of its Numerical Data Advisory Board (NDAB), a standing              board of the National Research Council, for the 12-month period from            July 1, 1988 through June 30, 1989.  NDAB's activities focus on                 numerical data for the scientific and technical disciplines (physics,           chemistry, and engineering), for space- and time-dependent disciplines          (the geosciences and biosciences), and for interdisciplinary and                sociotechnical fields (resources, energy, and environment).  NDAB               provides the United States' formal mechanism to interact with CODATA            (the Committee on Data for Science and Technology), which is a part of          ICSU (the International Council of Scientific Unions).  Through the             NAS, the National Science Foundation supports U.S. membership and               participation in both CODATA and ICSU.  In consideration of the merit           of NDAB as a way of improving the quality, reliability, accessiblity,           dissemination, informed use, and management of scientific data to meet          the present and future needs of the scientific and technological                community, and of the highly satisfactory management of U.S.                    participation in CODATA and in ICSU overall through the NAS, the                program manager recommends an award.",
