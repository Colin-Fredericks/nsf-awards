 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radiocarbon dating procedures have been an important means of              establishing the age of organic materials, such as buried soils.  By            dating materials, geomorphologists, archeologists, paleontologists, and         other scholars can use modern evidence to reconstruct past patterns and         processes.  Different estimates of dates have been derived from                 different facets of buried soils, however, that uncertainty                     significantly limits the confidence that scholars may place in the              conclusions drawn from examination of those materials.  This doctoral           dissertation research project will compare the dates of three                   characteristics of buried soils -- the humic acid, the humin (fine              residuals), and the soil in its entirety -- from a set of samples               gathered along the Republican River in southern Nebraska.  Dates                estimated by two independent laboratories will be compared to determine         which types of dating procedures produce the most reliable estimates,           which then will be used to estimate rates of soil formation and river           deposition at the test site.                                                         Benefits from this research will be realized at a number of                levels.  Most specifically, the findings will permit a more detailed            reconstruction of the soils and depositional history of the area.  At a         more general level, this work will provide greater insights into the            accuracy of radiocarbon dating of buried soils.  Although this                  analysis is based on an examination of alluvial soils from the Great            Plains, the results will have value for scholars using other types of           soils from other environments.  As a result, this work will have                positive impacts on a wide range of Quaternary inquiries.",
