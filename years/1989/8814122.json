 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Florida State Museum has recently acquired two important               collections of Recent mollusks:  the Thomas McGinty Collection                  and the Beal-Maltbie Collection.  Both contain numerous sets of                 specimens that are rare or come from environmentally disturbed                  areas which are threatened with further biological deterioration.               The collections have strong representation of specimens from the                United States and many tropical regions around the world and                    encompass all habitats from marine to freshwater to land.  In                   addition, they contain many type specimens that have been                       unavailable to science for the last forty years.                                     This project will fund the curation of the two new                         collections and their incorporation into the mollusk collection                 of the Museum, thus making the specimens available to                           researchers, students and other interested persons.  Contemporary               curatorial standards will be followed, and data about the                       specimens will be entered into the museum's electronic                          cataloguing system.  The newly acquired specimens are an                        important addition to the research and educational resources of                 the United States.",
