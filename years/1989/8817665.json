 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the effect of hydrologic                           modifications by beaver on vegetative patterns, successional                    transitions, and the distribution of nutrients on the aquatic                   portion of the boreal forest landscape.  The research is oriented                                                                                               around three related predictions (1) The physical structure of                  the landscape determines pond establishment and location, wetland                                                                                               shape and seasonal dynamics, but biological feedbacks (beaver-                  food, organic matter-redox potential) determine pond abandonment                                                                                                and long-term dynamics of the landscape.  (2) Variability in                    transition probabilities is determined by variations in the                     hydrologic regime and the food supply over different temporal                   scales.  Different lag times in various processes produce                       multisuccessional pathways and multiple equilibria.  (3)                        Resultant nutrient pathways are a response to beaver population                 dynamics, lag-time in the system, topography, and history of the                                                                                                affected areas.  The result is manifested by vegetative                         succession patterns from unique combinations of nutrient                        characteristics, hydrology, and initial vegetation.                                  The hypotheses will be tested by quantifying beaver-                                                                                                       landscape interactions on the 294 km2 Kabetogama Peninsula in                                                                                                   northern Minnesota from aerial photographs taken on 14 dates                                                                                                    from 1927 to 1991 (65 yrs).
