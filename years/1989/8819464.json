 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general field of analytical and surface                  chemistry and in the subfields of electrochemistry and                          spectroscopy.  Two spectroscopic techniques will be employed to                 probe electrode surfaces and nearby solutions.  Spatially                       resolved absorption spectroscopy will be employed to examine                    reactions of electrochemically generated species, particularly                  those undergoing catalytic oxidation-reduction reactions.  In                   addition, this technique will be employed to study diffusion to                 cylindrical microelectrodes and to electrodes of unusual                        geometry.  Generation of optical gain in electro-                               chemiluminescent systems will be attempted.  Raman spectroscopy                 will be employed to obtain structural information about                         electrogenerated species and to probe the surface of carbon                     electrodes.  The carbon surface spectrum will be correlated                     with the electrochemical behavior of the material.  The                         structure of surface oxides on modified carbon electrodes also                  will be examined.                                                                                                                                               Spectroelectrochemical investigations of the electrode-solution                 interface will enable correlation of the molecular surface                      states of electrodes with their electron transfer                               characteristics and thereby lead to a better understanding of                   heterogeneous electron transfer reactions at the molecular                      level.  Spatially resolved spectroelectrochemical studies will                  provide an experimental test of computer simulations of complex                 electrochemical reaction mechanisms and of diffusion at                         electrodes with unusual geometries.",
