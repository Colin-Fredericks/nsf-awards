 "awd_abstract_narration": "A decade ago, in Regents of the University of California v.                     Bakke, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the admissions plan of                the medical school at the University of California, Davis.  The                 plan reserved sixteen of 100 places in each year's entering class               for racial minorities.  The ruling generally has been interpreted               to mean that schools cannot use quotas but can practice                         affirmative action.  The Bakke case became almost a household                   word before the decision was reached.  In the public's view, the                case would go a long way toward symbolically setting the tone and               determining the speed of affirmative action in American society.                In addition, it would determine the validity of many professional               schools' admissions plans and, therefore, the composition of                    these professional schools' classes in the future.  Surprisingly,               despite its status as one of the most celebrated cases in many                  years, the actual impact of Bakke is unknown.  No serious                       scientific study has attempted to determine if Bakke had a                      significant effect on the crucial path to upward mobility--                     professional schools.                                                                                                                                           Drs. Welch and Gruhl will attempt to remedy this gap by assessing               the impact of the Bakke decision on minority enrollments in                     medical and law schools.  They will assemble three data sets: (1)               aggregate national data on minority enrollments in the first year               classes of law and medical schools from 1964 to 1986; (2) time                  series data on individual medical and law schools; and (3) survey               data from admissions officers.  Multivariate and interrupted time               series analyses will be used to test the general hypotheses that                the Court's decision striking down quotas made a significant                    change in the admissions patterns of several institutions, but                  that the Court's policy allowing affirmative action made less of                a visible change.                                                                                                                                               Not only is this research important because it is the first                     empirical inquiry into the effects of the widely discussed and                  controversial Bakke case, but also the Bakke decision offers a                  relatively rare opportunity to examine systematically the impact                of an important Court decision nationwide on both public and                    private officials.  Often, judicial scholars are forced by                      circumstances to look at only a small portion of those agencies                 that implement the Court's decision (police departments or                      schools, for example).  This study will examine every law and                   medical school affected by the decision and will be able to shed                light on important theoretical questions about the role courts                  play as policy makers, the impact court decisions have on                       behavior nationwide, and how different types of organizations                   respond to a court decision.",
