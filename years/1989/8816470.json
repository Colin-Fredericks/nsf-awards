 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. George R. Ricker and co-workers of the             Massachusetts Institute of Technology to collaborate with Prof. Yasuo           Tanaka and colleagues of the Institute of Space and Astronautical               Science, Japan, over a period of two years.  They will cooperate in             the development and testing of an X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD)             camera to be included as part of an imaging X-ray spectrometer on the           Japanese X-ray astronomy mission Astro-D, planned for launch in early           1993.                                                                                                                                                           X-ray spectroscopic measurements of galactic and extragalactic                  sources are planned for the Astro-D mission, with an energy resolution          not previously attained.  Distant active galactic nuclei, quasars,              and the remnant of supernova SN1987A  are among the objects to be               studied.  For selected distant objects, precise measurements of X-ray           redshifts will be made, measurements that will be important in                  themselves and at the same time useful in identifying astronomically            interesting sources for complementary optical and radio-astronomical            investigations.  It is the U.S.-Japanese cooperation in the scientific          aspects of this activity, including selection of objects for study in           Astro-D and in related ground-based observations in both countries,             that this project will seek to further.  The results are expected to            make a significant contribution in the field of X-ray astronomy.",
