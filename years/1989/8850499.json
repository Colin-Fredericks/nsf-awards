 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a model for implementation and evaluation of a        comprehensive staff development program to implement and sustain quality        elementary science curricula.  It will increase the strengths of                elementary teachers who are better prepared to teach science and develop        these individuals as instructors, coaches and facilitators of change for        those teachers who are less prepared.  Inquiry and discovery teaching           methods will be employed.  The model will include (a) science content           and concepts (b) new strategies for interfacing science with                    mathematics, reading, and writing (c) collegial support through                 demonstrations, discussions, peer coaching, and interactions with other         teachers in the project and (d) long-term support commitments from              participating districts.                                                                                                                                        Three school districts in Colorado, an urban, mid-sized city and a rural        district will participate in the four-year project. Specially qualified         teachers in local schools will be the first level participants to become        \"trainers\", who, in turn, will train \"tutors\" to work with their peers.         This multiplicative system will enable all the elementary teachers in           the districts to benefit from the project.  Administrators will                 participate in workshops which will involve science content and                 strategies from teaching science in order to facilitate the                     implmentation of change.                                                                                                                                        A ratio of 60% of the NSF request is being cost shared by the University        and the participating school districts.",
