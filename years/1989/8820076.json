 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous studies of learning ability have suggested that some                   genetic factor or factors are involved in the regulation of                     cognitive development, but the biological nature of such factors                remains largely unknown.  Dr. Wehner is searching for these                     factors using a clever animal model which encompasses both                      genetics and learning.  Highly inbred strains of mice are trained               to perform in a complex learning task, and their learning                       performances are then compared to the brain chemistry of several                identifiable regions in the brain.                                                                                                                              Each individual within an inbred population is equivalent to                    every other (like identical twins).  This provides an excellent                 population of subjects in which to examine how genetically                      determined components of brain chemistry might govern the                       processes of learning and memory.                                                                                                                               Dr. Wehner's studies are correlating the activity of the                        neurotransmitter acetylcholine with learning ability using both a               spatial and a non-spatial learning task.  It is well known, for                 example, that the hippocampus (a major structure within the                     forebrain) plays an important role in spatial learning, but that                it is not involved in many forms of non-spatial learning.  Thus,                these investigations are providing information about the nature                 of the learning process itself, as well as the role of genetic                  determinants of brain chemistry in different forms of learning.                 She has already observed, for example, that specific enzymes                    within the hippocampus vary with the learning abilities of                      different mouse strains.",
