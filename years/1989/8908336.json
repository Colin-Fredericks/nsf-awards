 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large vertebrate herbivores are believed to play an                     important role in regulating primary production of terrestrial                  ecosystems.  However, the specific form of their regulating                     influence and its mode of action have emerged as the focus of a                 significant, unresolved controversy in contemporary ecology.  It                has been observed that experimentally imposed increases in the                  population density of a large, generalist herbivore during winter               can stimulate production of perennial grasses in shrub.grassland                ecosystems during spring.  It is hypothesized that this                         stimulation may result from (1) the effect of browsing on                       competitive interactions between shrubs and grass, (2) the effect               of grazing on standing dead grasses and its consequences for                    availability of nitrogen and water and (3) fertilizing effects of               urine and dung.  Plot level experiments will be conducted to                    examine these mechanisms and seek support to plan those                         experiments.                                                                            The investigator and her colleagues are well qualified and              form an excellent team.  The institutional environment is first.                rate for the project as planned.  Research results should be                    significant in the area of basic ecology of browsing and grazing                as well as to the area of wildlife and forage management.",
