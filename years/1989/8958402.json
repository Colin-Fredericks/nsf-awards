The research addresses soil-structure                                           interaction under conditions of earthquake                                      and general dynamic loading.  Examples                                          include the interaction between a building or                                   bridge foundation (footings or piles) and the                                   soil on which it rests, or the interaction                                      between a tunnel, pipeline, power or                                            communication cable, and the ground through                                     which it runs.  This interaction may result                                     in damage to the structure.                                                                                                                                     The analysis of this phenomenon for the case                                    of small ground motions is a difficult                                          problem: for the large ground displacements                                     that occur near the surface fault of a large                                    earthquake, the problem becomes much more                                       difficult.  The goal of this project is to                                      develop a firm understanding of the subject                                     through a coordinated research program                                          involving (1) an investigation of the                                           corresponding fundamental problems in the                                       context of the theory of elasticity and                                         plasticity, (2) numerical modeling using                                        elasto-plastic constitutive theories by                                         finite element and boundary integral equation                                   methods, and (3) experiments to understand                                      the underlying physical phenomena.",
