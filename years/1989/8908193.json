 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide support for purchase of equipment to construct         an electrodynamic balance system for investigation of the interaction of        dispersed single particles and a gaseous environment.  In particular,           the apparatus will be used in studies of ambient and model aerosols and         in experimental simulations of processes that separate and remove               contaminants from gas streams.  The electrodynamic balance facility will        enable researchers to characterize the optical properties, chemical             composition, and kinetics of ambient and model aerosol particles.  This         project will involve determining the distribution of chemical species           within individual aerosol particles, the accuracy of light scattering           calculations, the index of refraction of single particles, hygroscopic          properties of single particles, and the kinetics of aerosol particle            evaporation.  The particle balance also will be used to investigate the         thermal decomposition of hazardous contaminants, the adsorption of              organics and heavy metals onto particles, the surface area of particles,        and the validity of numerical models that describe the removal of               gaseous contaminants by particles.                                                                                                                              The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF 87-         68, Engineering Research Equipment Grants.  The results of this research        investigation are expected to describe the fundamental mechanisms by            which potentially harmful contaminants may be prevented from entering           the atmosphere.",
