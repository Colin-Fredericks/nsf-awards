 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert Pecora is supported by a grant from The                        Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his                         theoretical and experimental studies of the dynamics of                         molecules in complex liquid systems.  Professor Pecora is                       studying the motions of polymeric materials, oligonucleotides,                  and DNA restriction fragments.                                                                                                                                  The main areas of complex liquids to be studied over the next                   three year period include: 1) reorientation, translation,and                    structure of small rodlike molecules both in solution with                      similarly sized solvent molecules and mixed with polymeric                      materials.  Particular systems include solutions of a                           homologous series of double helical oligonucleotides, and                       motion of a series of rodlike probes in amorphous and glassy                    polymethylmethacrolate. 2) dynamics of single semirigid rodlike                 polymer chains including theoretical and experimental studies                   of a homologous series of monodisperse DNA restriction                          fragments prepared using genetic engineering techniques.  3)                    motions of rigid and semirigid molecules in nondilute solutions                 including studies of oligonucleotides and DNA restriction                       fragments and ternary solutions containing solvent, and rodlike                 macromolecules mixed with either coils or coated silica spheres.                                                                                                A broad range of experimental techniques are used in these                      experiments including: transient electric birefringence, light                  scattering, interferometry, photon correlation spectroscopy,                    and force Rayleigh scattering.  Theoretical techniques include                  both analytical modeling and computer simulations.",
