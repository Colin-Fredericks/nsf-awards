 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been suggested by some scholars over the years that the                  American jury is a legal, political institution whose benefits to               jurors include direct participation in the system and the                       educative effects of that experience on their own behavior.  It                 is assumed that jury service increases both a citizen's knowledge               of and attachment to democratic legal principles and that it can                affect the legal behavior and attitudes of those who serve.                     However, these ideas have not been systematically researched in                 either the jury or the participation literature.  Most jury                     research has focused on the internal dynamics of the                            decisionmaking process itself or the administrative aspects of                  the system.                                                                                                                                                     This doctoral dissertation study focuses on the question of                     whether the above assertions regarding the effects of jury                      service accurately characterize the consequences of the                         contemporary jury experience.  A combination of in-depth                        interviews and a panel design, pre- and post-jury service, will                 be used to measure systematically these effects and to test some                of the assumptions of the attitude change and participation                     literature.  In addition, data from the trials in which potential               respondents are serving will be gathered, coded, and integrated                 into the analysis of effects.                                                                                                                                   The extensive use of the jury system in the United States                       provides analysts of legal, political participation an                          opportunity to explore an arena that they have been missing.  It                affords analysts of the jury an opportunity to consider the                     larger role of the institution they study.  In particular, it                   provides an opportunity to study how jury service affects                       knowledge of and support for (or criticism of) legal norms and                  processes.  This study helps bridge the gap that exists between                 jury research, political participation research, and studies of                 the relationship between legal institutions and political                       attitudes.",
