 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study develops models of marriage and fertility by                         examining their links to variations in women's status.  The                     timing of marriage and of marital fertility are posited to be                   the result of a sequential decision-making process that may                     differ among cohorts and by social strata.  This variability,                   in turn, may reflect differences in educational and economic                    opportunities across communities.  The extent to which women                    are economically independent, have access to contemporary                       knowledge, and live in egalitarian families are specified as                    three key measures of women's status.  Increases in status in                   terms of these dimensions are hypothesized to lead to delays                    in marriage and to fertility limitations within marriage.                       These hypotheses will be tested using data procured from two                    groups of women, one aged 25-31 and those the other 40-49,                      who live in four geographically, economically, and socially                     distinct rural subregions of Colombia and in metropolitan                       Bogota.  These areas were selected to maximize variability on                   the key dimensions of women's status.  This research is                         important in that its findings promise to provide cogent                        evidence about the effects of women's status within a                           community on their fertility.",
