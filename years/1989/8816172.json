 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many multicellular animals require specialized molecules to transport           enough oxygen in their blood to metabolizing tissue.  Metabolic                 demands of the tissues, however, often change in response to                    environmental perturbation, which can in turn modify the                        microenvironments in the blood and thus the functional properties of            the oxygen carriers.  For several decades it has been known that the            oxygen transport system in some animals can adapt to metabolic demand           and/or environmental change by responding to extrinsic molecular                cofactors.  Only recently has it been shown that intrinsic molecular            change is also a mechanism of adaptation.  The proposed research will           further elucidate the nature of the intrinsic molecular changes that            permit the commercially important Chesapeake Bay blue crab to adapt to          changes in environmental salinity and temperature.  This investigation          will also determine the extent to which intrinsic molecular changes             accompany speciation and thus permit closely related species of crabs           to adapt to different environments.                                                                                                                             Finally, because material from a \"living fossil\" unexpectedly became            available, the oxygen transport properties of the blood of a rare fish          and its close relatives will also be elucidated.",
