The first, to focus an                                              interdisciplinary effort on selected wind                                       engineering research problems related to the                                    quality and safety of the human environment.                                    The second, to contribute the results of                                        research to the activities of the upcoming                                      United States Decade for Natural Disaster                                       Reduction (USDNDR) and to the International                                     Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction                                           (IDNDR).  The CRPWE will be guided by an                                        external Technology Assessment and Advisory                                     Council (TAAC) consisting of ten to twelve                                      nationally and internationally recognized                                       experts in wind engineering.  Faculty,                                          graduate and undergraduate students from                                        different Departments and from both                                             Universities will exchange freely between the                                   two institutions.  Several tasks identifying                                    specific research problems in wind                                              engineering will be addressed by CRPWE by                                       focussing on the measurement of flow and                                        structural behavior of full-scale buildings                                     and structures, physical models of the same                                     and similar configurations in meteorological                                    wind tunnels, validation of analytical and                                      numerical wind engineering models, and                                          extrapolation of the results to design codes                                    and engineering practice.  Wind loads on low-                                   rise buildings, non-boundary layer                                              simulation, building roofing performance,                                       prediction of extreme wind, and numerical                                       modeling of flow are some of the topics to be                                   investigated interdisciplinarily.  The data                                     gathered, the evaluations performed and the                                     design recommendations prepared from the                                        research performed will lead to a safer and                                     economically more viable building                                               environment, better able to protect people,                                     and capable of withstanding the onslaught of                                    hurricanes, tornadoes, and windstorms.",
