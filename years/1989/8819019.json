 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Oliver demonstrated earlier that when dried moss is rehydrated a            unique set of proteins are synthesized very early in the plant's                recovery phase (it only takes a few hours for the moss to regain its            normal metabolic activities).  The PI believes that these are the               proteins that are involved in the repair of the water-stress induced            damage.  Dr. Oliver also determined that the synthesis of some of the           major proteins that are made under normal conditions is dramatically            decreased during this recovery period.  The work that the PI intends to         complete over the period of the grant will be aimed at elucidating how          this switch in the pattern of protein synthesis is accomplished.  This          is the first step in understanding the genetic basis of a naturally             occurring desiccation-tolerance mechanism.                                                                                                                      This research is important to understand the mechanism by which this            plant is able to withstand severe drought.  Drought is a major                  environmental problem that causes millions of dollars loss some place           in the U.S. every year.  This research may elucidate the mechanism that         allows some plants to withstand drought much better than others.",
