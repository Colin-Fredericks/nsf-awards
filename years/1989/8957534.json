 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research in this project is concerned with the                     modeling and analysis of growth-related defects induced by                      thermal and mechanical stresses and melt weight in the                          production of large high quality crystals.  The goals are to                    describe the scientific phenomena of heat, solute, and melt                     transport determining the crystal structure and composition,                    and to elucidate the coupled dynamics of these transport                        mechanisms.  The results of this study will aid the design of                   material processing technique by defining optimal temperature                   profiles and freezing rates to gain control over the                            solidifying interface and to minimize thermal stresses in the                   crystal.                                                                             Coupled asymptotic/numerical methods will be implemented                   to take advantage of the disparity in length and time scales                    associated with these problems.  The approach is to reduce the                  governing equations to a system which is simpler for analysis,                  but which retains much of the physics of the process.  The                      simpler system may be a single evolution equation describing                    the shape of free solidifying interface, or a coupled set of                    fields together with a consistent description of any deformable                 interfaces.  The achievement of specified criteria for the                      grown crystal will require the location of a system parameter                   solution manifold yielding the optimal growth conditions.                       These techniques of analysis will be developed for directional                  solidification, float-zone, crystal sheet, and fiber growth                     systems.",
