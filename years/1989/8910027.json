 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research project is to determine the cellular and               molecular events that underlie the guidance of axons within the                 developing mammalian central nervous system.  Dr Dodd has                       identified an intermediate target in the trajectory of a class of               commissural neurons that appears to play a pivotal role in their                guidance within the embryonic rat spinal cord.  This structure,                 termed the floor plate, consists of a set of specialized                        epithelial cells.  Although intermediate targets have been                      described in invertebrates they have not previously been observed               in vertebrates.  The effects of the floor plate on the morphology               of commissural growth cones will be examined.  In an EM study,                  floor plate.commissural growth cone contacts for morphological                  evidence of cellular communication through specialized junctions                will be examined.  In addition, the surface properties of floor                 plate cells will be characterized using immunochemical methods                  and the function of these molecules in floor plate/growth cone                  adhesive interactions that may be important for guidance at the                 midline will be examined.  Many of the mechanisms that have been                hypothesized to account for pathfinding by developing axons as                  they extend towards their final targets are based on experiments                performed in invertebrates or in the peripheral nervous system of               vertebrates.  The studies described here will provide new                       information about the guidance of developing axons within the                   mammalian central nervous system and already suggest emerging                   parallels in the strategies and mechanisms by which neuronal                    projections are established in vertebrates and invertebrates.",
