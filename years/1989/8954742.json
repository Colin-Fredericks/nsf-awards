 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Directory of Student Science Training Programs for High Ability             Precollege Students informs students, teachers, counselors, and parents         of opportunities for student participation in the United States and in          some countries abroad.  The Directory also helps program directors of           national programs by providing them with needed national publicity,             reaching students that their budgets would not permit them to reach on          their own.                                                                                                                                                      The Directory was started by Science Service in 1982, when the National         Science Foundation ceased publishing its own Directory.  The Directory          has grown from 54 listings the first year to 612 for the 1989 edition.          The distribution has grown from a printing 35,000 the first year to             77,000 for the 1989 edition.  The costs have thus greatly increased.                                                                                            In 1986, Science Service was awarded a grant of $60,000 over a three-           year period in support of the publication while alternative sources of          continuing support could be developed.  Advertising was chosen as the           best possibility and successfully started, with 18.9% of the current            (1989) Directory being covered by paid advertising.  The interest shown         by advertisers and potential advertisers suggests that the Directory            could come close to the break-even point in three to five years.                                                                                                A three-year grant of $90,000 over a three-year period is therefore             requested in partial support of the Directory while paid advertising            support is developed.",
