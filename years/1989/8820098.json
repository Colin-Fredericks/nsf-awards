 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing the ability to communicate in a particular code                      involves learning not just how to produce that code, but also how               to use it.  Dr. Pepperberg will study these processes by                        determining the conditions that are required for teaching a                     subject a repertoire that it would not normally acquire (an                     \"exceptional code\"), and then examining its functional use of                   this code.  Dr. Pepperberg has shown previously that training                   procedures that rely on referential social modeling enable an                   African Grey parrot to acquire and combine English vocalizations                (an exceptional code) to (a) request, refuse, quantify, identify,               and categorize objects, and (b) control, to a limited extent, its               immediate environment.                                                                                                                                          Dr. Pepperberg will (1) extend her study to a second parrot,                    examining the effects of (a) species identity of the social model               (i.e., parrot vs. human) and (b) varying degrees of social                      interaction between the trainers and trainee; (2) examine the                   level of acquired competence by investigating the extent to which               this code can be used for comprehending questions, numerical                    concepts, object-object relations, prepositions, referring to                   objects not physically present (displacement), describing novel                 objects or circumstances (productivity), recognizing two-                       dimensional forms, use of verbs, negation, and how labeling may                 affect the ability to recall an object.  These tasks are                        comparable to those that have been used with dolphins and non-                  human primates.  In this way, Dr. Pepperberg's research is                      expanding our view of the cognitive capabilities of a non-                      mammalian species.                                                                                                                                              Dr. Pepperberg also will continue to examine how social modeling                may offer insights into other studies of vocal learning.  Through               such analyses, she is broadening and deepening our scientific                   understanding of the development of bird song and of human                      speech.  Training techniques that she devises may prove valuable                in work with developmentally retarded persons.",
