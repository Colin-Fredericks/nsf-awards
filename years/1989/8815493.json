 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in metallurgy                    between Dr. Didier de Fontaine, University of California at                     Berkeley and Dr. H. Dreysse, Laboratoire de Physique du Solide,                 University of Haute Alsace, Mulhouse, France.                                                                                                                   This project concerns the theoretical study of phase quilibrium in              metal, semiconductor or superconducting alloys, including studies               of surfaces and interfaces.  Electronic band structure calculations             have progressed to the point where quantitative prediction can be               made concerning the stability of various competing phases in                    metals, alloys and simple compounds.  Statistical thermodynamical               methods have also been developed so that, by combining both quantum             and statistical techniques, certain classes of alloy phase diagrams             can now be derived almost from first principles.  The purpose of                the proposed collaborative research is to combine the expertise of              both the Mulhouse and Berkeley groups to perform such combined                  quantum/statistical calculations by means of methods which have                 been developed by the two groups independently.  The Berkeley group             has gained considerable expertise in the theoretical study of alloy             phase diagrams by the Cluster Variation method; the Mulhouse group              has specialized in the electronic structure of solids.  The results             of this research will contribute to the understanding of predictive             thermodynamics of materials.",
