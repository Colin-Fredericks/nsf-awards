 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research equipment grant is for the purchase of                            fluorescence lifetime and transient fluorescence equipment to                   be used primarily by the two co-PIs Torkelson and Lewis as                      well as other researchers at Northwestern.                                                                                                                      Torkelson's research is the application of fluorescence and                     phosphorescence techniques in the study of basic issues elated                  to polymer science and engineering:  diffusion-limited                          interaction in polymer solutions, phase separation in polymer                   blends and in block copolymer systems in solution and the bulk                  state, the distribution of local free volume and its                            sensitivity to physical aging in polymer glasses, and                           polymer-polymer interpenetration, interdiffusion, and                           correlations in homopolymer and block copolymer systems.  The                   focus of Lewis' research is the investigation of reactions                      which occur via electronically executed complexes which are                     used to establish the role of exciplexes and radical ion pairs                  in reactions of fundamental importance to organic                               photochemistry such as cycloaddition and proton transfer.                       Near term uses planned for the instrumentation include:  the                    study of diffusion-limited interactions in polymer solutions                    which may lead to a better understanding of the gel effect in                   free radical polymerization; investigation of phase separation                  phenomena and compatibilization in block copolymers solutions,                  blend with homopolymers, and in the bulk state; intermolecular                  correlations in homopolymers, block copolymers and polymer                      blends; obtaining local free volume distribution in amorphous                   polymer systems; determination of the mode of diffusion in                      polymer welding phenomena (interdiffusion across a                              polymer-polymer interface); characterization of the basic                       photophysics of polymer systems; excimer and exciplex kinetics                  studies; and investigations of excited state of Lewis acid                      complexes.",
