 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to perform a petrologic analysis of an                unusual sample suite dredged from the south wall of the Blanco                  fracture zone. Preliminary analyses of the magnesium content of                 these rocks indicate that they may represent primary liquids                    derived from considerable depth, but the analyses of iron and                   aluminum contents are not consistent with the magnesium content.                Additional data analyses coupled with major and trace element                   modelling will elucidate the petrogenesis of this unusual rock                  suite.                                                                          %%%                                                                                     Much can be learned about sea floor magmatic processes by               studying unusual suites of rocks recovered from the sea floor.                  The samples to be studied by Dr. DeLong fall into that category                 because most rock samples appear to have undergone a complex                    history before arriving at the sea floor.  These rocks may have                 been derived directly from source rocks that have melted at                     considerable depth and this might provide fundamental insights                  into the nature of primary source rocks for the oceanic crust.",
