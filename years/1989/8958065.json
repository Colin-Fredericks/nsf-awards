 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new technique will be used for measuring surface brightness                   fluctuations of galaxies.  Surface brightness fluctuations in                   external galaxies and globular clusters are the pixel-to-                       pixel fluctuations that arise from the counting statistics of                   the unresolved stars in each pixel.  This fluctuation                           amplitude varies inversely as the distance of the galaxy, and                   is proportional to the luminosity of the giant stars, and                       therefore can be used as a new and independent determination                    of extragalactic distances, and as a probe of stellar                           populations.  The real strength of this technique is that it                    gives distances based on the luminosity of ordinary giant                       stars and so avoids the traditional \"extragalactic distance                     ladder,\" which has proven so hard to pin down reliably.                                                                                                         The theoretical basis of this measurement, and observations                     the show that the technique is feasible to distances of at                      least 20 Mpc has been carried out.  Three phases of effort                      will be carried out:  1) a rich sample of equidistant                           galaxies in the Virgo                                                           cluster, which will serve to calibrate the method, will be                      observed; 2) galaxies in the local supercluster and in nearby                   clusters will then be observed.  To map the Virgo infall and                    other large-scale motions; and 3) a theoretical analysis of                     stellar populations which should permit a more reliable                         determination of the Hubble constant using this method, and which               also can provide interesting insights into stellar populations in               systems where individual stars cannot be resolved, will be                      performed.                                                                                                                                                      Some fraction of time will be allotted to other projects such as                working on the southern sky redshift survey, collating the data                 and creating a final, uniform catalog.",
