 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid urban population growth has become one of the most                   distinctive attributes of Third World development since the Second              World War.  Not only has growth occurred in preexisting large cities,           it has also taken place in numerous small pioneer towns on frontiers.           The emergence and growth of new settlements has important social and            environmental implications, but the patterns of frontier urbanization           have not received a great deal of attention.  Based on a comprehensive          review of secondary source materials and a comparative analysis of two          emerging centers in the Brazilian Amazon, this project has as its goal          the illumination of the larger political-economic role of frontier              urbanization in the process of national and global capital                      accumulation.  The investigators will study under what political and            economic circumstances new settlements originate; what functions are            provided by the rapidly growing frontier settlements; how these                 functions have changed over time in response to regional production in          mining, timber, and agricultural sectors; to what extent frontier towns         provide services, employment, and consumer opportunities necessary for          the social reproduction of the local population; what industries emerge         in the new Amazon towns; and how these industries are linked in capital         composition to national and transnational enterprises.                               This innovative and timely study will develop a model of landscape         change and urban transformation using a number of research methods              drawn from spatial analysis, history, and historical geography.  This           research effort offers a contemporary test of theory at a time when a           clearer understanding of the development of urban frontiers can                 contribute to policies concerning settlement expansion in the Amazon,           one of the world's most important and fragile ecological areas, and it          is also likely to add to our knowledge of frontier urbanization in              other tropical areas of the world.",
