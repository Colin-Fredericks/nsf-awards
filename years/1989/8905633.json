This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic, corporate,               and government cooperation in the support of basic research in                  the mathematical sciences.                                                           This equipment will be used to support three research                      projects in the Department of Statistics at the University of                   Connecticut: Interval Estimation and Estimation of Mixture                      Distributions, directed by Dipak Dey; Nonparametric Regression                  and Scale Parameters, directed by Lynn Kuo; and Topics in                       Stochastic Geometry and Dependence, directed by Richard Vitale.",
