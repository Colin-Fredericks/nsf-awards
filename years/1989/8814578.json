 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors Howard Kaufman and John W. Woods of              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to collaborate in research in                  computer image processing with Professor Jan Biemond of the                     Department of Electrical Engineering of the Delft University of                 Technology, The Netherlands.  The objective of their collaboration              is to evaluate various image sequence restoration techniques in                 terms of their effectiveness and efficiency on different parallel               computer architectures.  In particular, Professor Biemond will use              iterative based procedures and an AP500 array processor, while                  Professors Kaufman and Woods will use recursive based procedures                and a Sequent Balance 8000 multiprocessor system.  Identification               of the spatial and temporal image dynamics will be considered by                both investigators.  Another important aspect of the cooperative                research will be in algorithm design.  It is important that a good              cross-section of procedures be used to give all processors the                  chance to perform in their own domains.  At the same time, the                  methods of implementation have to be closely analyzed to make sure              that the measurements on the architecture's power are fair.                                                                                                     The area of fast restoration of distorted image sequences is one of             growing importance, for which effective techniques are needed.                  Real-time image enhancement is becoming increasingly more feasible              due to recent hardware advances, such as DSP chips and parallel                 architectures.  Image restoration is usually more computationally               intensive and is more difficult to achieve at high speeds.  The                 goals of this collaboration are ambitious, but the expected result              of meaningful comparisons of different methodologies will be very               worthwhile.",
