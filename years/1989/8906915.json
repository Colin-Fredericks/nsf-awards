 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Florida group will carry out research in                 theoretical gravitational physics which will involve the                        application of analytic and numerical techniques to the study of                black holes, compact stars and clusters, cosmological problems,                 and quantum aspects of gravity.  Binary systems consisting of two               black holes might form fairly often in galactic nuclei and become               important sources of gravitational radiation.  The evolution and                emission properties of such binaries will be studied with new                   techniques.  The study of neutron stars will continue.  One                     activity will imploy further the Butterworth-Ipser numerical code               to decipher observable structural properties of rapidly rotating                relativistic neutron stars.  Another will employ new \"Eulerian\"                 techniques to study nonaxisymmetric pulsations and stability,                   with emphasis on the maximum rotation rates expected to be                      observed.  Star clusters, which possibly form in galactic nuclei                and collapse to massive black holes, will be studied, with the                  focus on their stability properties.  Estimates will be made of                 the distribution of dark matter in galaxies to assess the                       viability of local experimental detection of dark matter.  Tools                such as path integrals and spinoral techniques will be used to                  study quantum-gravity problems such as the early Universe and                   late stages of black-hole evaporation.",
