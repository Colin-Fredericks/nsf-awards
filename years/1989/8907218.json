 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ambitious project extends game theory and applies game                     theory to the study of durable goods monopoly and income tax                    auditing.  More specifically, the project examines game                         theoretic equilibria that are rationalizable strategies in a game               derived from the original game by adding a strategy for a player                which allows that player to get the equilibrium value of the                    original game for sure.  Earlier work has shown that these                      equilibria can be used to unify different work on signalling                    games.  The goal of this project is to extend the results to more               general games.                                                                                                                                                  A model of dynamic monopoly with entry of new consumers is                      characterized.  This model seems to have stationary equilibria                  in which the seller loses the ability to price discriminate as                  the time between offers shrinks, and nonstationary equilibria in                which the seller maintains some monopoly power.                                                                                                                 The project develops a three-level model of tax setting and                     enforcement.  The government sets tax rates, penalties for                      noncompliance, and a budget for the auditor.  The auditor                       determines which reports to audit.  Taxpayers determine how much                income to report.  The project characterizes the linear tax and                 auditing budget that maximizes a social welfare function.  The                  resulting characterization is used to find conditions under which               it is optimal for the auditor to be under budgeted.                                                                                                             This exciting project makes important contributions to game                     theory, industrial organization and public finance.  The research               in game theory develops and generalizes a new way of examining                  the robustness of the results obtained from games by adding                     strategies with fixed outcomes to the original game.  The work in               industrial organization has already obtained surprising evidence                of the persistence of price discrimination that has implications                for government policy.  The extensions should improve our                       understanding of the ability of durable good monopolists to price               discriminate via periodic sales.  The third part finds evidence                 that the middle-income taxpayers are over-audited by the IRS.                   The hierarchical model of income tax auditing used for this part                of the project should provide other novel insights in public                    finance.",
