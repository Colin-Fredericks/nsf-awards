 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whether abiotic or biotic processes are primarily                          responsible for the patterns within natural communities remains                 an important question.  In streams, ecologists have traditionally               emphasized abiotic factors, but increasing evidence suggests that               biotic interactions structure lotic communities.  In central Ohio               streams, a crayfish species replacement is undeniably occurring,                providing a unique opportunity to test rigorously those biotic                  processes controlling benthic invertebrate distribution and                     abundance.  Three potential mechanisms are to be explored:                      differential reproductive success, differential competitive                     ability, and particularly differential vulnerability to fish                    predation.  Specifically, it will be determined if the direct and               indirect effects of predation and competition can explain this                  species replacement.  Field surveys, lab experiments, and field                 manipulations will clarify how differential size, growth, and                   habitat use influence each of these three alternative mechanisms.               Because of the ongoing nature of this crayfish replacement, it is               believed that this is to be a model system for studying biotic                  processes in streams.",
