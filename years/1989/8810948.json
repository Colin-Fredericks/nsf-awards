 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) of trypanosomes has a highly unusual                     structural organization consisting of thousands of catenated                    DNA circles termed maxicircles and minicircles.  In addition,                   these circular DNA molecules appear to replicate under cell                     cycle control and minicircles, in particular, are segregated                    into distinct domains of the kDNA network depending on                          whether or not they have been replicated.  The structural                       organization of kDNA networks at different extents of                           replication will be investigated as a means of elucidating                      the mechanisms controlling the precise duplication of                           individual networks.  The mechanisms that prevent the final                     covalent closure of duplicated minicircles and thereby                          prevent their replication a second time prior to segregation                    of daughter networks is of a particular interest.  The manner                   in which maxicircles are catenated to the network and the                       possible role of bent helical DNA segments of minicircles in                    targeting duplicated minicircles to a specific domain of the                    network will also be explored.  Additionally a search will be                   made for proteins that may be involved in the condensation                      and organization of the DNA network in vivo.                                                                                                                    The mechanism of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells and the                    coordination of replication with the cell cycle are                             fundamental problems in biology.  Kinetoplast DNA contains                      two distinct types of replicons, minicircles and maxicircles,                   both of which, unlike mammalian mitochondrial DNA, are                          replicated coordinately with the cell cycle.  In addition,                      the genes that regulate kinetoplast replication are likely to                   be encoded in the nucleus and may be similar or related to                      the genes controlling nuclear DNA synthesis.  Thus, the                         kinetoplast DNA system offers an opportunity to understand                      fundamental aspects of the growth and division of eukaryotic                    cells.",
