 "awd_abstract_narration": "Issues of openness, secrecy, and sharing in the communication of                scientific and technical information are central both to                        scientific progress and to individual, group and societal                       control.  Beginning in the late 1970s, the United States enacted                export laws and administrative regulations governing the transfer               of technology to countries that could be potential adversaries.                 Since these laws defined \"technology transfer\" to include                       dissemination of scientific and technical information, policy                   makers applied them to presentations of unclassified reports and                attendance of certain foreign nationals at technical meetings;                  institutions receiving grants signed contracts allowing agencies                to review and edit papers prior to publication.  Many                           representatives of the scientific and engineering communities                   voiced opposition to these policies, viewing them as violative of               free speech and destructive to the open environment in which                    science can flourish.  Little systematic research has been done                 on the impacts of these controls, however.  This project will                   provide information about the effects of national security                      controls on the conduct of unclassified scientific research and                 the dissemination of its results.  With oversight from a balanced               advisory group, the project team will undertake a telephone                     survey of 2,000 active scientists and engineers, research                       managers, leaders in scientific societies, and journal editors                  to:  (1) determine the extent to which they understand the                      restrictions; (2) assess how they balance values of openness                    with protection of national security, and (3) document the                      impact of restrictions on research practice and dissemination.                  The project's findings, including policy recommendations, will be               made widely available through a monograph, articles, symposia,                  and press releases.                                                                                                                                             This project is being undertaken by a well-qualified team of                    researchers and advisors; institutional support is very good.                   The research and dissemination plans are appropriate; results                   will provide rich data about the impacts of secrecy policies on                 research.  Results will be relevant to both researchers and                     policymakers.  Support is recommended.",
