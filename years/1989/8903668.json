 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims at studying bottlenecks related to chip                      inputs/outputs, memory bandwidth, memory size, and data dependencies in         special-purpose computers for signal processing application.  The goal          is to theoretically quantify these problems and systematically ease             them through algorithm design, algorithm transformation, and joint              design of architectures and algorithms.  Research is carried out on             identifying the nature of problems in signal processing applications            and experimenting with applications related to video compression and            continuous-speech recognition.                                                                                                                                  Real-time signal processing systems often lack proper tradeoffs among           performance requirements, costs goals, and VLSI technological                   limitations.  There is a strong need to study dedicated or application-         specific architectures that are very efficient for the given                    application.  This research addresses the issues related to the                 bottlenecks that arise in the implementation of application-specific            signal processing systems.  It extends previous work, which mainly              addressed problems related to throughput.  Results obtained allow               better design tradeoffs in the design of special-purpose signal                 processing systems.",
