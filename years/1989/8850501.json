 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Foundation is offering a 24 month program         for the enhancement of teachers responsible for 9th or 10th grade first         year science courses.  These teachers will develop activities and               material that can be integrated into their own curricula which will             provide students with an understanding of the fundamental processes of          science.  The program will consist of recruitment and selection of a            group of specially talented teachers.  Prior to the summer workshop,            these teachers will contact local practicing scientists, industrial,            academic and/or government, to discuss what scientific processes are            necessary to carry out science research and applications as well as to          determine what students need to know about science to be literate and           informed citizens.  The teachers will bring this information to                 Princeton, where, during an intensive four-week workshop, using the             facilities of Princeton University, they will (1) meet with a                   representative group of scientists to explore what is common to all of          the items that they discussed in their preparation, (2) talk with other         researchers about their hypotheses and research materials on topics of          interest to young teenagers, (3) develop modular units reflecting their         research that can be incorporated into such courses and (4) receive             training in the background and necessary science to implement such              materials.  The material will be edited and published by the Foundation,        after which it will be available for use by all the participants as well        as in outreach projects.  Funds will be available at the close of the           workshop for these outreach projects initiated by the teachers for              sharing this material with other teachers and administrators during the         ensuing twelve months.  One or two teams will be organized from the             participants that can travel throughout the country presenting one-week         institutes for teachers during the summer of 1990 at centers already            established by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation's Master Teacher program.                                                                                          Evaluation will be conducted on the outreach beginning in June 1990, and        repeated again four months after the teachers who attend the institutes         return to school, in December, 1990.  Results will be tabulated and             written up in January and February, 1991.                                                                                                                       The amount of funding requested from the NSF represents less than 25% of        the total budget for this program.  Other sources of funding are private        corporations, foundations and individuals, money from the United                Federation of Teachers New York City Teachers Centers Consortium, New           York City Board of Education, Ford Foundation, Flint Scientific, IBM,           individual universities which are sites of the outreach programs and            local industries.",
