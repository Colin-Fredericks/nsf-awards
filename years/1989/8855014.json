 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past six years, Florida State University has offered an                 academically intensive, 6-week residential summer program in science,           mathematics, and computer science for fifty-four gifted and high-               achieving high school students.  The program is designed to offer               college-level experience in high technology areas to outstanding public         and private high school students of Florida.                                                                                                                    The program includes a mix of formal instruction, field trips, and              research participation in mathematics, computer science, and in the             biological, physical, and behavioral sciences.  The curriculum includes         college-level course work in discrete mathematics and in computer               science for all participants, with elective laboratory course offerings         in molecular biology, modern physics, and other basic science areas.            These courses are designed for and limited to the students of this              program.  The emphasis throughout is on problem solving and the                 integration of contemporary theory with application.                                                                                                            Each student is also expected to complete original work in a research           laboratory setting on the Florida State campus or in one of its                 associated research field stations.  Assignments with specific faculty          incorporate the interest and background of the participants to the              extent possible.                                                                                                                                                Student progress in the subject matter areas is evaluated by written            examinations with grades and class ranking established for each course.         This information does not appear on the student's high school                   transcript, but is part of an individual evaluation letter developed for        each student.  The students are also evaluated on their written and oral        presentations covering their individual research project.",
