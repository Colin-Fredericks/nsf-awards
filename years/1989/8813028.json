 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three year theoretical program to study nonlinear optical properites          of nobel metal grains (gold, silver and copper) and semiconductor               grains (Cd SexS1-x) embedded in glasses or suspended in colloidal               solutions is proposed.  The research will also focus on size                    dispersion, shape variations and polymeric coatings on the particles            to enhance the optical nonlinearities.                                                                                                                          The project involves the theoretical formulation of the dynamic                 properties of quantum confined carriers in these grains and the                 calculation of the dielectric function.                                                                                                                         A generalized effective medium theory will be developed to obtain the           overall dielectric response of the composite material which includes            the metal or semiconductor grains and the dielectric host material.             The generalized effective medium theory will be tested by numerical             simulation of the composite medium.                                                                                                                             The resultant dielectric functions will be used to study the spatial            propagation of electromagnetic waves in the medium.  Our description            will include transverse modes and forward- and backward-wave                    propagation to obtain realistic analysis of the materials.  The                 investigators will study absorption and reflection of the                       electromagnetic waves, as well as, multiwave mixing.  Experimental              data on these materials will be analyzed in terms of these dielectric           functions.                                                                                                                                                      The phenomena of optical bistability and optical phase conjugation              will also be investigated in the composite materials.  This project is          expected to lead to a realistic assessment of the application of these          materials for nonlinear optical devices.",
