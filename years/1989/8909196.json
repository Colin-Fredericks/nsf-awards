 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to gain insight into automating               engineering reasoning about physical systems through the                        construction and utilization of a qualitative model addressing                  the domain of fatigue and fracture in metals.  Engineering                      problem solving requires an understanding of how physical systems               behave even when only incomplete and nonnumeric information is                  available on the parameters which influence that behavior.  For                 this reason, qualitative physics is one of the critical areas                   requiring key advances to support intelligent computer aided                    engineering.  Engineers make extensive use of abstraction and                   simplifying assumptions in construction and manipulation of                     mental and analytic models.  Formalization of modeling                          assumptions and construction of a multilayered qualitative domain               model capable of supporting reasoning at various levels of                      abstraction and under various sets of assumptions are goals of                  this project.  The domain of application is that of fatigue and                 fracture in metals.  This aspect of material behavior has wide                  engineering applicability.  The envisioned qualitative model                    encompasses a range of physical phenomena within the domain such                as high cycle fatigue and low cycle fatigue.  More specific                     models can then be automatically generated by setting initial                   assumptions.  After the qualitative model has been built, its                   capabilities for qualitative simulation and comparative analysis                will be studied.  The end product will be an intensive                          qualitative domain model and a systematic understanding of its                  predictive behavior.",
