 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the California Institute of Technology                       (Caltech), in cooperation with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory                    (JPL), requests funds to establish a Science and Technology                     Center for the Development of An Integrated Protein and Nucleic                 Acid Biotechnology.  The Director of the Center will be Professor               Leroy Hood.                                                                                                                                                     The Center will implement an analytical approach to the computer-               assisted analysis of patterns of protein expression using two-                  dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis, and will characterize the                molecular structure of the observed proteins by developing                      methods for sequence analysis of the                                            proteins obtained directly from the 2-D gels.  The qualitative                  and quantitative information from the 2-D gel patterns along with               the molecular sequence data will be combined in a new form of                   protein data base.  This will allow the rigorous comparison of                  results obtained in one laboratory with those obtained in any                   other.  The Center will also extend the techniques available for                rapid cloning and sequence analysis of the corresponding genes,                 and will develop novel algorithms and state-of-the-art hardware                 for thorough comparison of the resulting data with extant data in               protein and DNA sequence data bases.                                                                                                                            One of the key problems in molecular biology is understanding how               individual genes are turned on and off in appropriate tissues at                the correct developmental stage, and how the coordinated                        expression of particular batteries of genes in individual cells                 gives these cells their unique characteristics.  Hence, one of                  the fundamental problems in developmental biology relates to                    following the qualitative and quantitative changes that occur in                the expression of hundreds of proteins.  This translates into the               need for rapid identification, cloning, and sequencing of the                   individual genes and gene batteries responsible for directing                   this complex pattern.  The development and implementation of the                integrated technologies and new instrumentation for the                         characterization of proteins and nucleic acids, as described                    above, will change the course of modern biological research on                  these and other fundamental biological problems.",
