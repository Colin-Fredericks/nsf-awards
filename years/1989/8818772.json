 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allochthonous inputs of organic matter to woodland streams                 comprise the principal energy source for diverse groups of                      detritivores during all, or for various stages of their life                    cycle.  However, this statement only refers to the ability to                   ingest detritus and it remains poorly understood what components                of detritus are assimilated.  Associated microbial biomass is                   known to only contribute 12-45% of the dietary needs of the                     detritivores examined.  Since detritivores lack the enzymes to                  degrade major plant structural components, it is suggested that                 other components of detritus are exploited by detritivores.  It                 is proposed that the major dietary requirements of detritivores                 are provided by dissolved organic matter (DOM) which is                         associated with and/or released from coarse particulate organic                 matter (CPOM).  The major source of this DOM is derived from                    organics which are:  1) released from the matrix of ingested                    detritus; 2) released from extracellular microbial products; or                 3) transformed by microorganisms associated with their alimentary               tract.  It is hypothesized that detritivores have evolved a                     variety of feeding and digestive strategies to maximize the                     utilization of these resources.  These are 1) physico-chemical                  properties associated with their midgut to release and digest                   these compounds; and 2) metabolism by hindgut micro-organisms and               assimilation of these metabolites by detritivores.  Studies will                include:  1) characterization of the temporal qualitative and                   quantitative nature of DOM which is associated with and/or                      abiotically released from CPOM; and 2) determining the relative                 assimilation and fate of these ingested compounds.  The                         significance of these studies not only applies to the basic                     principles of detritivore nutrition and growth, but to an                       understanding of carbon sorption, retention and turnover in lotic               systems.",
