 "awd_abstract_narration": "Issues of openness, secrecy, and sharing in the communication of                scientific and technical information are central both to                        scientific progress and to individual, group and societal                       control.  Industry is an increasingly important contributor to                  this country's scientific research effort, and any discussion of                information sharing, openness and secrecy in science should                     include an analysis of industrial policies and the practices of                 industrial scientists.  This project will explore information                   sharing policies in the pharmaceutical industry and the                         information sharing, openness and secrecy practices of                          pharmaceutical chemists.  In-depth interviews will be conducted                 with several companies' chemists and chemistry managers.                        Managers will be asked about company policies and guidelines;                   chemists will be asked about their external communication                       activities, company policies and the decisions they make about                  what to share and with whom they share scientific information,                  data and results.  These interviews will be analyzed and the                    results used to design a questionnaire for a large sample of                    chemists and managers.                                                                                                                                          This study comes from a promising researcher at a primarily                     undergraduate institution; research plans are appropriate and                   incorporate undergraduate research assistance.  Institutional                   support is good.  The project will provide rich data about                      information sharing, openness and secrecy policies and their                    effects on the external information sharing practices of                        industrial scientists.  Results will be relevant to both                        researchers and policymakers.  Support is recommended.",
