 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program will support research on two rather diverse                   projects in organometallic chemistry. In one of these projects                  new metal-containing derivatives of the molecule decaborane                     will be synthesized and studied. The new compounds are expected                 to be useful as precursors for metal borides, a group of                        materials valued for their exceptional thermal stability,                       strength and hardness. In the other project the possibility of                  carrying out organic syntheses on the diironhexacarbonyl                        framework will be be explored. The iron compound is a member of                 a class of compounds which contain two or more metal atoms per                  molecule and which are important as industrial catalysts and as                 models of metalloenzymes.                                                                                                                                       The goals of the research project are:                                              (1) To develop novel and potentially useful                                 proximity-assisted ligand reactions in chemistry which is based                 on salts of the mu-CO,mu-RS-diironhexacarbonyl anion.                                (2) To use the above anions as starting materials for the                  synthesis of novel dibridged complexes and to explore the                       reactivity of the bridging ligands in these new complexes.                           (3) To develop further the organometallic and organic                      chemistry of decaborane. Of particular interest is the                          synthesis of adducts of decaborane with such early transition                   metals as titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium and                   tantalum.",
