 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will establish a                       service-oriented facility to analyze radiocarbon samples on                     behalf of the ocean sciences community.  The Accelerator Mass                   Spectrometry (AMS) Facility will use newly developed techno-                    logy, modern instrumentation and automated sample preparation                   procedures.  The Facility is required to analyze radiocarbon                    and other tracer samples collected during upcoming field                        programs of major Global Geosciences projects and individual                    research grants.                                                                                                                                                Chemical tracers are powerful tools for describing oceano-                      graphic processes.  The analysis of several natural and                         anthropogenic chemical constituents of seawater, such as                        Carbon-14, provides information on long-term mixing and                         circulation in the deep ocean, on upwelling, and on air-sea                     carbon dioxide exchange processes.  These processes have                        major implications for understanding the forces that affect                     climate variability and the chemical interaction of the                         carbon cycle and biological productivity.  The description of                   processes such as these is central to major oceanographic                       investigations planned for the next decade.                                                                                                                     AMS technology reduces required sample size by a factor of                      1,000, to 250 milliliters of seawater, for achieving the                        requisite level of precision to define the geophysical                          processes under investigation.  Given the large number of                       samples needed for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment                       (WOCE), the Global Ocean Flux Study (GOFS), and other geo-                      sciences programs, the AMS Facility will be operated on a 24-                   hour a day basis to meet scientific requirements.  Present                      plans call for the analysis of up to 4,000 C-14 samples                         annually with precision of +/- 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent.                                                                                                      The Institution will provide cost-sharing in terms of                           engineering and architectural drawings and will construct the                   required laboratory addition to house the AMS Facility.",
