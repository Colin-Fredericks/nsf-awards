 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past several years, scanning transmission x-ray                      microscopy has become a reality.  The objective of this project                 is to develop auxiliary equipment, and the required knowledge                   base, to make this form of microscopy useful for biological                     studies of whole cultured cells.  This work is intended to make                 it practical to view whole, wet, unstained cells with a spatial                 resolution ten times finer than that of the light microscope.                   The cells may be either alive or fixed.  This new kind of                       microscopy has broad significance for researchers in cell biology               and neurobiology, particularly those studying the relation of                   cellular ultrastructure to function.                                                                                                                            We will develop a specimen system appropriate for imaging live                  cultured cells.  Prototype images will then be obtained to                      determine the extent to which the natural contrast of unstained                 specimens reveals their ultrastructure.  Immunostaining                         techniques for whole fixed cells will also be characterized.                    Studies of radiation damage effects will be made to define the                  acceptable range of exposures for maintaining both short-term and               long-term integrity of live cells and fixed specimens.  A                       modified system optimal for imaging specimens smaller than whole                mammalian cells, such as bacteria or myofibrils, will also be                   developed.",
