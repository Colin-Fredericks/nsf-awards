 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent evidence has implicated a role for the phosphorylation and          dephosphorylation of specific MTOC components in regulating the                 functional activity of the mitotic apparatus.  The purpose of this              proposal is to define the functional properties of the centrosome and           kinetochore with respect to the nucleation and capture of microtubules          respectively, to determine the role of phosphorylation of centrosomal or        kinetochore components in modulating their functional properties, and to        identify kinase and/or phosphatase dephosphorylation of the mitotic             microtubule organizing centers.  We will initially characterize the             microtubule nucleation capacity of the centrosome in lysed cell models,         and compare this activity with isolated centrosomes.  Functional                properties of kinetochores will be determined using isolated mitotic            chromosomes.  The phosphorylation state of the MTOCs will be analyzed by        32P incorporation and also the phosphate specific antibodies.  The              affect of dephosphorylation on the defined functional properties will be        determined following in vitro dephosphorylation.  The functional assays         will then be utilized to screen fractions of mitotic cell lysates for           appropriate enzymatic activities.                                                    Defining the role of phosphorylation in MTOC function is a key             facet of a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for the                regulation of cell division in general and the function of the mitotic          apparatus specifically.",
