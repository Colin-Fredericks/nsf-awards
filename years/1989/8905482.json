 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many mathematical models for microbial ecosystems assume the               environment to be homogeneous, as simulated by the chemostat.  It               is well established that such an environment does not support                   competitive coexistence.  This project will focus on two factors                that can lead to coexistence: heterogeneous enviornment, and time               lag between nutrient consumption and population growth.  The                    gradostat is a laboratory system related to the chemostat and                   simulates ecosystems with spatial heterogeneity in the form of                  substrate gradients.  The mathematical model for competition in                 the gradostat is an example of order.preserving dynamical systems               which have been studied in great detail in recent years.  The                   study will give better understanding of growth dynamics in                      gradient.like environments and suggest new experiments to be                    performed with the gradostat.  Growth delay has been observed                   experimentally but its mathematical models have not been studied                extensively.  The principal investigator will study model                       equations which are integrodifferential equations where delay is                described by a kernel in the Volterra integral which reflects                   growth being affected by consumption at all previous time, i.e.                 distributed delay.  The goal is to determine if competitive                     coexistence can be expected with growth delay in general, or only               with certain special forms of delay.",
