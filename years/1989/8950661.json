 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computational chemistry facility has been established at Harvey Mudd          College which allows the offering of a laboratory course in quantum             chemistry.  Students in chemistry and chemical physics have broad               backgrounds in physics and mathematics which make this course                   accessible.  This course broadens the undergraduate experience of               students interested intheory and will acquaint students having                  experimental interests with a range of theoretical methods that are             frequently used in the literature.  In addition, several of the faculty         have theoretical components to their research which involve                     undergraduates.  The computational facility will greatly enhance the            opportunities for theoretical work by undergraduates in the areas of ab         initio quantum chemistry, numerical simulations of electrochemical              processes, and statistical mechanics.  The institution is matching the          NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
