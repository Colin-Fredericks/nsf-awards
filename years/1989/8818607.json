Carbon suboxide will be used as a unique                       source of the small carbon-rich molecules which are believed to                 serve as building blocks for non-petrochemically derived carbon                 compounds in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Carbon suboxide                     will be used as a source of oxygen in the selective oxidation                   of organic compounds under mild conditions.                                                                                                                     Carbon suboxide will be used as a source of carbon fragments                    for the formation of metal complexes of such species as                         carbide, ketenylidene and ketene. Suitable metal systems will                   be sought for the activation of nitrous oxide toward oxygen                     transfer reactions to organic moieties in both stoichiometric                   and catalytic fashions. Nitrous oxide will be used also as a                    reagent for preparing interesting oxo-complexes under mild,                     kinetically controlled conditions. Such reactions are expected                  to be very clean, since the only by-product of nitrous oxide                    decomposition is dinitrogen.",
