 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent experiences in France with \"cohabitation\" and minority                   Government demonstrate that the rules of parliamentary procedure shape          the behavior of parliamentary actors and consequently play a central            role in determining policy outcomes.  These experiences also show that          electoral outcomes determine opportunities for parliamentary actors to          utilize parliamentary rules.  Hence, if we are to understand how                French parilamentary institutions promote - - or inhibit - - the                political representation of French citizens, it is essential that we            clearly understand how parliamentary institutions in France shape               behavior by parliamentary actors.                                                                                                                               This doctoral dissertation research project examines theoretically and          empirically parliamentary decision making rules, political influence,           and legislative outcomes in the French National Assembly.  The research         attempts to describe and explain how election outcomes shape                    opportunities for parliamentary actors to utilize parliamentary rules           in ways that influence final policy.  The study focuses on the use of           parliamentary procedures by four actors:  the President, the Government         (i.e., the prime minister and cabinet), committees, and private                 members on the floor.  As a theoretical framework, the study relies             heavily on formal, deductive models of legislative choice.                                                                                                      The plan of research includes two tasks to be accomplished in Paris,            France.  First, the relationship between procedural rules and                   legislative outcomes will be assessed by constructing a data set that           codes various procedures invoked in connection with bills submitted to          the National Assembly during four different periods in the last twelve          years.  Items that will be coded include motions to delay, motions to           censure, blocked votes, referrals to the Constitutional Council,                gatekeeping by committees, gatekeeping through agenda control by the            Government, declarations of non-germaneness of amendments, presidential         \"vetoes\" of decrees, conference committees with the Senate, and the             Government status.  Second, interviews will be conducted with the               Assembly's parliamentarian, the permanent secretaries of several                committees, and deputies from several parties in order to learn how             these actors perceive the relationship between decision rules and               legislative influence during the periods of interest.                                                                                                           This study will contribute significantly to our understanding of how            French parliamentary institutions and election outcomes shape                   opportunities for parliamentary actors to influence policy.  The study          will also illuminate the assumptions that must be made to model                 legislative institutions that are unique to parliamentary systems,              making possible a more general theory of legislative choice in                  democratic systems.",
