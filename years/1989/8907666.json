 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the design and implementation of a programming           system for building highly parallel applications on networks of                 multiprocessors.  Multiprocessor based shared memory multiprocessors            are becoming widely available and promise to provide cost effective             high performance computing.  Multiprocessor workstations will surely be         widely available within the next year:  one expects them to be even             more cost effective than their mainframe counterparts for many                  applications, just as current uniprocessor workstations often are more          cost effective than uniprocessor mainframes.  Simply stated, the goal           of this research is to provide a facility for programming a network of          multiprocessors as if it were a large, integrated, shared memory                computer.                                                                                                                                                       This effort requires study of several aspects of operating system               structure.  First, there is a search for programming primitives that            provide the right level of abstraction for expressing parallel                  algorithms.  The important tradeoff, in a system integrating                    parallelism and distribution, is providing uniformity of access across          the network without sacrificing local performance.  Second, one must            explore alternatives in operating system organization for increasing            performance on a single multiprocessor node.  The objective here is to          provide the lowest overhead mechanisms for parallel execution so that           programmers can express and utilize medium grained parallelism.  Third,         one must develop tools that aid the programmer in assessing the                 performance of his or her application, and in properly optimizing it            for an environment of networked multiprocessors.                                                                                                                This project is a natural outgrowth of a program of research in                 distributed and parallel computing systems in which we have been                involved for the past 8 years.  This program of research has been               supported by NSF under a variety  of awards; it also has received               significant support from industrial sources, particularly Digital               Equipment Corporation, whose Firefly prototype multiprocessor                   workstations will be our experimental vehicle.  (The DECSystems                 Research Center has supplied Fireflys to Washington, Stanford, MIT,             Princeton, Toronto, and Cambridge, making these universities uniquely           well equipped to conduct experimental research on medium scale                  multiprocessing.)  The results that we have already obtained in our             preliminary work on support for parallel computing are in active use by         many university sites and by companies such as Sequent, Digital,                Microsoft, and Tera.",
