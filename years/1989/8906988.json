Dan Crawford and Tod Stuessy of Ohio State University                 will use molecular DNA information to study the evolution of                    three genera of plants occurring on the Juan Fernandez Islands,                 located 600 km west of central Chile.  Oceanic islands, and the                 Juan Fernandez archipelago in particular, offer ideal systems in                which to study plant evolution.  It is possible to place a time                 frame on the origin and evolution of plants on oceanic islands                  because the islands can be dated geologically with reasonable                   accuracy.  In the Juan Fernandez, the older island (Masatierra)                 is four million years old while the age of the younger island of                Masafuera is one to two million years.  The flora of the Juan                   Fernandez is small in numbers but contains a high percentage of                 unique (endemic) species.  This makes it feasible to study the                  origin and evolution of the endemic plants on the archipelago.                       The two largest endemic genera are Dendroseris and                         Robinsonia in the sunflower family, Asteraceae.  These are                      bizarre tree-like plants whose presumptive ancestors from the                   South American mainland can only be guessed from morphological                  comparisons.  The use of molecular characters such as chloroplast               DNA restriction sites and sequences, ribosomal DNA, and protein                 iszoymes will help to compare the island taxa with mainland                     species and determine possible progenitor stocks.  Molecular                    methods will also be employed to determine evolutionary                         relationships among the species of Dendroseris and Robinsonia on                the islands, and to study the evolution of a third genus in the                 archipelago, Erigeron.  Field trips with Chilean scientists and                 students will provide materials for these comprehensive studies.                Once origins and phylogenetic relationships of these insular                    plants are determined with DNA and protein data, it will be                     possible to study the important changes in life-form and                        physiology associated with dispersal to and establishment upon                  isolated oceanic islands.  This in turn should lead to a better                 understanding of processes involved in the evolution of new plant               species.",
