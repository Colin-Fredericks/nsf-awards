 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project pursues significant, unresolved questions in dynamic               general equilibrium theory.  The first part develops convex                     models of endogenous growth with special emphasis on the                        following areas: (1) the analysis of the determinants of growth                 and the possibility of sustained growth; (2) the study of the                   process of innovation or new product development; and (3) the                   study of the dynamic effects of taxation.  The project explores                 the connections between these three areas and extends this work                 into open economy settings.                                                                                                                                     The second part concerns the use of general equilibrium models of               imperfect competition to understand aggregate phenomena.  In                    particular, these models are used to study the existence of                     Keynesian \"low output\" equilibria and unemployment due to                       increasing returns and private information.                                                                                                                     This research should provide new insights into economic growth,                 technological change and tax policy.  Previous work by the                      investigator tying the literatures on dynamic taxation and the                  determinants of growth demonstrates that different tax policies                 and trade policies can generate permanent differences in the                    growth rates of different countries.  This project will extend                  the past work with special emphasis on the effect of market                     power, education and different economic policies on sustained                   economic growth in an open economy.",
