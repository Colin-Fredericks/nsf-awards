 "awd_abstract_narration": "The way in which plant species exchange pollen during mating            determines which individuals make a genetic contribution to the                 next generation.  This breeding structure thus effects levels of                genetic variation and potential patterns of evolutionary change                 in the population.  Dr. Loveless will examine how different                     individuals sample the pool of available pollen from their                      neighbors and the effects of this mating system on progeny                      genotypes.                                                                              The study species, \u001a\u001a\u001aTachigali\u001a \u001aversicolor\u001a (a legume) is             especially interesting because it is outcrossed.  The progeny of                different fruiting trees are thus likely to have sampled pollen                 from conspecific individuals in the immediate vicinity of the                   seed parent.  This permits Dr. Loveless to isolate and measure                  the effects of the spatial population structure on mating                       systems, and to assess  the amount of variation in the mating                   system  among individuals flowering in a single season.  The tree               is also monocarpic; each individual flowers once and dies.  The                 presence of known and aged cohorts of seedlings in the forest on                Barro Colorado Island, Panama, will allow assessment of                         particular elements of the reproductive biology  of this species                which result from spatial and phenological structure in the adult               population.                                                                             The results of this work should have bearing on                         understanding of the processes by which genetic diversity is                    generated and maintained in tropical plant populations, and on                  the ecological processes by which pollen is moved about in rain                 forest communities.  The data should also contribute in a general               way to theories of plant mating systems which are applicable to                 both temperate and tropical plant species, and should be                        important in plant breeding and in understanding                                microevolutionary processes in natural communities.  Such                       information is important in tree breeding programs to measure the               degree of isolation required and the range over which pollen                    might be transported.  It also impacts efforts to assess minimum                critical population sizes for canopy rain forest tree species,                  based on breeding biology of the species.",
