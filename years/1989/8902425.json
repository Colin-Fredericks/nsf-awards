 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Enright's program of mathematical research has                   three main aspects. The first is the continuation of a study                    investigating the connections among systems of differential                     equations, certain affine varieties called determinantal                        varieties, and highest weight representations for a Lie group.                  The second objective is to present a theory of special functors                 on categories of modules for a Lie algebra which will allow the                 extension of the functorial methods of Zuckerman and Vogan to a                 domain which includes Kac - Moody Lie algebras. The third aspect                is a study of unitarizability for representations of Kac -Moody                 algebras.                                                                            This project has to do with the representation theory of Lie               groups (and of their cousins, Lie algebras), which bear the name                of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie. One basic example of a               Lie group is the group of rotations of a sphere, where the group                operation consists of following one motion by another. Detailed                 information concerning this group is very helpful in solving                    mathematical or physical problems in which spherical symmetry is                present. Other groups of motions capture other kinds of symmetry.               A more algebraic (as opposed to geometric) source of examples of                Lie groups comes from the multiplication of matrices. The group                 of all invertible real (or complex) matrices of a given size is a               Lie group, as is just about any subgroup thereof that can be                    described in a natural manner. It is desirable to be able to go                 back and forth between the geometric and algebraic points of                    view, for instance to consider the numerous ways in which the                   rotation group of the sphere can be realized as a group of                      invertible matrices. This, roughly, is representation theory.                   Facts about the representations of a given group tend to store a                lot of information very economically. Transfer of this                          information, say between two different ways of keeping track of                 the representations of a single group or algebra, is something                  Professor Enright is involved in studying. Although Lie objects                 in the classical sense are finite-dimensional, there has lately                 been a great deal of interest in their infinite-dimensional                     analogues, whose investigation is also part of this project.",
