 "awd_abstract_narration": "The expression of mammalian proteins in conventional procaryotic and            eukaryotic culture systems has many inadequacies.  These shortcomings           may preclude their successful utilization in bioreactors for the                large-scale production of post-translational modified proteins.  It is          important to note that most human proteins possess a significant                degree of post-translational modification.  Even mammalian tissue               culture systems which possess the necessary enzymatic machinery to              make these modifications have limitations both with respect to                  inherent culture instability and expression levels.  This is                    complicated by the high cost of culture media required for tissue               culture.  Preliminary research indicates that all of the above                  problems may be overcome by transgenic expression in large animals.             An assessment of the current developments in basic transgenic biology           is necessary such that its potential can be focused and advanced to             become a part of the current gamut of emerging biotechnologies.  This           is a main goal of the workshop entitled, \"Mt. Lake Va. Preworkshop and          Minisymposium on Large Transgenic Animals as Bioreactors.\"                                                                                                      The large-scale production of proteins which have therapeutic value is          now performed for only a very few proteins.  These proteins are either          very simple molecules such as insulin or are effective in small                 quantities for one-time catastrophic events.  This is the case for              tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) which is                                     a protein used in the treatment of a heart attack which is in                   progress.  TPA is an illustrative example as its cost and limited               availability are so prohibitive as to confine its use to (almost                exclusively) emergency room situations|  Proteins which are only                effective as chronic therapies (ergo, on a long term basis) are                 not as a rule available in sufficient quantity or in a                          biologically active form as produced by current bioreactor                      technology.  The use of transgenic cows as bioreactors may                      provide the solution to these protein production impasses through               its unsurpassed ability to make protein in milk.  Conservative                  estimates have put a single, average (transgenic) cow's annual                  production of any given important therapeutic protein in excess                 of tens of millions of dollars.  This agricultural-                             biotechnological marriage would necessarily breathe new life into               both the dairy and cattle industries as well as the people who                  now die as result of the unavailability of therapeutic proteins.",
