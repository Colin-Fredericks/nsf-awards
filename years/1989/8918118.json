This is                       especially true for the marine sciences.  A program to increase                 the participation of minority undergraduates in marine science                  will be initiated.  The specific activities will include:  1)                   setting up a planning office for the newly formed Minority                      Institution Marine Science Association (MIMSA); 2)                              establishing a communication network for use by members of the                  Southern Association of Marine Labs (SAML) and MIMSA; 3)                        gathering and disseminating information on minority                             undergraduates interested in marine science and activities at                   marine science institutions that would be of interest to these                  students and HMCU faculty members; 4)  developing a list of                     minority scientists who could act as seminar speakers and role                  models for the minority students; and 5)  providing funds for                   other activities for minority undergraduates, such as, summer                   internships, travel to participate in cruises or field trips.",
