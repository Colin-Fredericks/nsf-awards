 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tissue morphogenesis is the process by which the form of the body               and its various organs are established in the embryo, and by                    which normal and abnormal changes in the adult, such as wound                   healing and tumor invasion, are brought about. Dr. Newman and Dr.               Forgacs propose to conduct interdisciplinary studies on the                     physical mechanism of \"matrix-driven translocation\", and adhesive               interaction between particles or cells and extracellular                        macromolecules that resembles tissue morphogenesis in several                   respects. The movement of particles in this experimental system                 will be analyzed in terms of the physical theories of \"wetting\"                 and \"percolation\". They proposed that cells or particles and                    collagen fibers can form percolation networks, which constitute                 distinct physical phases. These phases can then spread along, or                interpenetrate between, other phases or substrata. These ideas                  may account for certain fundamental properties of tissues. By                   manipulating various parameters in the matrix-driven                            translocation assay, such as particle concentration and size, and               collagen concentration, these concepts can be tested in a manner                not feasible with living tissues. Moreover, by studying                         mathematical models of systems that exhibit percolative and                     wetting behavior, they can assess the adequacy of these ideas to                explain various properties and behaviors of tissues.                            %%%                                                                             Tissue morphogenesis is a complex phenomenon involving cell                     movements resulting ultimately in the final form of the adult                   organism. Drs. Newman and Forgacs have attempted to isolate and                 characterize a subset of these complex processes in a model                     system that mimics some of the behavior of migrating cells. They                will study this model in an attempt to gain some insight into the               more complex phenomena of cell migration during embryogenesis",
