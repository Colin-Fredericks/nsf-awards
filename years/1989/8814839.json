 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad theme of this research is the creation of                        intelligent, dexterous, self-sustaining machine tools for the                   small-batch manufacturing industry.  With previous National                     Science Foundation support, the Principal Investigator has                      developed an expert system that plans the setup processes for                   rectangular-type parts in a parallel-sided vise on a three-axis                 Computer Numerical Control (CNC) milling machine.  At the same                  time, clamping and fixturing methods have been systematically                   studied and an automated fixturing device has been made and used.                    The specific work consists of: (1) broadening the expert                   system planning software to encompass more complex part shapes                  that will require more setup steps, the use of toe-clamps and the               possible use of more complex fixtures, (2) combining this expert                system approach with a more solid mechanics approach to stable                  fixturing that will come more into play as our parts increase in                complexity away from the simple rectangular parts held in a                     parallel-sided vise, and (3) the construction of prototype                      fixtures that can handle more complex part types.                                    In this research, the software that integrates the machine                 tool planning and clamping functions is referred to as the                      Unified Machining Planner; the programmable hardware that will be               developed is referred to as the Flexible Clamping System.",
