 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Fredrick Richardson is supported by a grant from the                        Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his                         research on the electronic structure, optical and                               magneto-optical spectroscopy, and coordination properties of                    lanthanide ions and complexes in solution and in the solid                      state.  This research will have practical applications in the                   design of lanthanide-based optical materials for lasers, the                    use of lanthanide ions as structural probes for biological                      systems, and the characterization of lanthanide coordination                    properties in solution.                                                                                                                                         The primary emphasis of Richardson's research is on the                         properties and processes associated with the lanthanide 4f                      electrons and their interactions with ligand and crystal                        fields, magnetic fields, and radiation fields.  Richardson is                   attempting to develop quantitative relationships between                        optical properties, electronic state structure, coordination                    number and geometry, and ligand structure of lanthanide                         complexes containing polyatomic ligands, multidentate chelate                   structures, and functionally specific ligand substituents that                  influence optical properties in specific ways.  Two-photon                      absorption and electronic Raman scattering experiments will                     investigate ligand-field interactions and states not accessible                 to study by one-photon optical absorption and emission                          techniques.  Chiroptical measurements will also be used to                      study detailed state structure of several classes of systems.",
