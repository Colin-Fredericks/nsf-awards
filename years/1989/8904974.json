 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mating system or social-organizational structure of an animal               species or population is a fundamental aspect of its biology in                 the field.  It affects the ways in which animals exploit                        resources in a region and how individuals compete for resources                 and for reproductive success.  Such systems differ in different                 species.  The overall system in a society is the product of the                 individual behavioral responses of the animals in the society.                                                                                                  The goal of this project is to determine the behavioral                         tendencies of animals living in different systems, in an attempt                to understand what individual behavioral patterns are important                 in producing the system.  Voles of the genus Microtus are ideal                 research subjects, as they live in different mating systems and                 adapt well to the laboratory.  Dr. Dewsbury will continue                       studying four species of voles:  prairie voles and pine voles,                  which are often monogamous, and montane voles and meadow voles,                 which are often polygamous.  Among the traits to be contrasted                  are development, play, mate choice, and sperm competition.  The                 results will contribute to a general understanding of different                 mating systems and the factors that underlie them.",
