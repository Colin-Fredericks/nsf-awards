 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) at the University of                     Wisconsin-Madison, is a national facility for the utilization of                ultra-violet and soft x-ray synchrotron radiation in scientific                 investigations.  The studies carried out at SRC impact a number                 of disciplines including condensed matter physics, atomic and                   molecular physics, chemistry, and materials science and                         engineering, and other disciplines.  SRC is a user oriented                     facility which accepts proposals from all qualified                             investigators.  It supports a community of 388 users from 58                    university, national, and industrial laboratories.  There are 18                beamlines in operation now, six are under development, and five                 more are proposed.  Included are two dedicated beamlines in                     operation, one under development and two more allocated for the                 Center for X-ray Lithography. An x-ray microscope using an                      undulator as its source is under construction.  Research                        performed at SRC has proved extremely productive, with recent                   publications corresponding to 15% of the world-wide total for the               same period.  The responsiveness of SRC and its users to new                    developments is shown by the 25 recent papers on high-temperature               superconductors, the first submitted in April 1987.  The addition               of a soft x-ray beamline, and the improvement of the 1 GeV                      storage ring operation for higher currents are planned.  The ring               improvements will provide more high energy radiation which are                  especially important for the x-ray lithography program.",
