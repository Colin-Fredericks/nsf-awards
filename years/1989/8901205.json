 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jonathan Losos, a doctoral student working under the                       supervision of Dr. Harry Greene at the University of California-                Berkeley, is conducting an integrated study of anatomical                       adaptations, ecology and performance (jumping ability, sprint                   speed, clinging ability, etc.) of Anolis lizards of the Caribbean               Islands set in context of the evolutionary history of the group.                Anatomical studies of the numerous species of Caribbean Anoles                  suggests considerable parallel and convergent evolution has                     occurred in anatomy, behavior and performance skills among                      distantly related species as a result of adaptation to similar                  ecological conditions. Losos studies the ecology and behavior of                lizards in natural habitats; the animals are then captured and a                number of performance variables measured in a field laboratory;                 morphological measurements are subsequently made. The latter                    include measures of mass, body size, limb-length and scanning                   electron microscope assessments of digital lamellar hairs which                 function in adhesion. Integrated studies such as this, that take                advantage of diverse species in natural environments, lead to an                understanding of how species evolve adaptations to their                        environments. This, in turn, provides basic information on how to               protect the biodiversity of the earth.",
