 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a three year investigation of collaborative problem              solving in science for the purpose of developing accounts of learning           and problem solving by middle school students and developing                    instructional strategies and materials that improve both students'              conceptual understanding of science and their capacities for self-              regulation in complex problem solving situations.  Year 1 is an                 intervention study investigating the comparative effects of three               instructional conditions:  a) mediated independent problem solving, b)          group problem solving, and c) mediated group problem solving.  This             investigation will be conducted in eight classrooms as the students             study a unit on the nature and properties of matter.  Analyses of Year 1        data will occur in Year 2 for the purpose of:  a) evaluating the success        with which the desired outcomes were achieved across the various                conditions in terms of conceptual understanding, self-regulatory                abilities, and internalization of the social norms practiced across the         three conditions, b) evaluating the reasons for the outcomes,                   principally through microanalysis of classroom interactions, and c)             revising the instructional procedures.  In Year 3, we will investigate          the implementation of the revised instructional program in eight                classrooms.  The proposed study will contribute both to research on             problem solving and conceptual understanding in science and to the              improvement of educational practice, focusing on the opportunities for          teachers and students to work together in \"learning communities.\"",
