 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will focus on the mechanism and factors                   responsible for the development of autoimmune demyelination in                  the central nervous system.  Central nervous system myelin is a                 sheath that covers the axon and together (myelin and axon) are                  functionally responsible for transmitting signals from the brain                to other parts of the body.  Any disturbance in the association                 between myelin and axons, such as myelin loss (demyelination),                  will have grave effects on brain function.  Demyelination is an                 immunological process that involves the body's defenses,                        particularly the white cells (known as lymphocytes); once                       activated, the white cells enter the brain and begin the process                of demyelination.  Recent studies using a rat animal model have                 shown that the process of white cell activation involves a                      particular antibody, a unique protein produced by another type of               white cells.  The aim of this study is to prepare large amounts                 of this antibody with highly restricted specificity, known as                   monoclonal antibody, and document the molecular properties.  A                  second monoclonal antibody against the first antibody will be                   prepared, using both monoclonal antibodies to study synergistic                 and/or antagonistic roles in the activation of white cells.  A                  clear understanding of the mechanism responsible for activating                 and controlling the processes by which a particular white cell                  destroys normal myelin of the central nervous system is                         anticipated, utilizing the unique experimental system in this                   study.",
