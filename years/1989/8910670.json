The information obtained will                 enable the bonding energies of such systems and their reaction                  paths to be determined.                                                                                                                                         The systems being investigated are bound only by van der Waals                  forces in the ground state, but are chemically bound in some                    excited states.  The rotationally resolved spectra of such                      mercury complexes as Hg-water, Hg-ammonia, and Hg-ethylene are                  being studied by laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy to                     determine the binding energies and vibrational frequencies in                   both the ground and excited states.  The dynamics of relaxation                 and reaction are being probed by fluorescence lifetime studies.",
