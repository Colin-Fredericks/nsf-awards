 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under Professor Browman's guidance, Ms. Patti Wright, a graduate                student at Washington University, will collect archaeological                   data for her doctoral dissertation.  She will participate in                    excavations at the site of Tambo Viejo located on the desert                    coast of southern Peru.  Her work will focus on the examination                 of plant remains.  Previous work at the site has shown that,                    because of the environmental conditions, plant remains are                      extremely well preserved.  Ms. Wright will conduct excavations                  and screen soil in different areas of the site to collect                       carefully controlled floral samples.  These remains will be                     classified according to such variables as provenience, mode of                  preservation, size class, and anatomical part.  With such data,                 it will be possible to gain insight not only into the subsistence               practices of ancient Peruvians but also the factors which affect                the differential preservation and distribution of floral remains.               In conjunction with this archaeological research, Ms. Wright will               collect extant specimens to provide reference material.  She will               also construct four experimental plots and introduce flora in                   known amounts and types.  These will be left exposed to the                     natural elements.  Several plots will be preserved for future                   analysis while others will be excavated.  This will permit                      examination of post-depositional forces which pattern the                       archaeological record and overlie and distort the original                      cultural imprint.                                                                                                                                               Archaeologists realize that it is extremely difficult to recover                cultural behavior from excavated remains.  While very little work               has been done with flora, faunal remains have been extensively                  examined.  The research has indicated that very special                         techniques for analysis must be devised.  It has also shown that                the imprint by post-depositional factors is strong and additional               approaches must be developed to control for this.  Very little                  attention has been devoted to floral remains, and this work will                help to remedy this problem.                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons.  It will develop                techniques which will have wide archaeological applicability.                   Secondly, it will further the training of a very promising young                scientist.",
