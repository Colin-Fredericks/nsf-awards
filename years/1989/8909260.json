 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sulfur compounds in the atmosphere are known to contribute                 to acid rain.  More recently, the chemical sulfur cycle has                     been suggested to influence the reflectivity of the Earth and,                  hence, the global climate.  A primary step in this mechanism is                 the production of dimethylsulfide (DMS) by marine organisms.                    The DMS enters the atmosphere and eventually produces particles                 that may promote cloud formation.  The details of this process                  are not well understood.  A region where this mechanism is                      thought to be particularly important is the northern extremes                   of the Pacific Ocean.                                                                This project initiates an investigation into the role of                   biologically produced sulfur in the Gulf of Alaska.                             Methodologies for the measurement of non-sea salt sulfate and                   methanesulfonic acid in marine aerosols, as well as DMS in air                  and seawater, are to be developed.  The long-term objectives                    are to quantify the temporal and spatial distribution and flux                  of DMS in the Gulf of Alaska and to determine reaction pathways                 for DMS.",
