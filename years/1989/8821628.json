 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators for this Accomplishment Based Renewal are concerned           with the conditions under which democracies are able to be sustained            over time.  The importance of this research derives, in part, from the          significance of this topic and the fact that voting, public opinion and         political participation are fundamental to the promise and performance          of democratic forms of government.  The setting of this empirical work          is Canada, a country that is one of the world's oldest functioning              democracies, but one that continues to encounter support-eroding                problems that most other mature democracies already have resolved.  The         research focuses on the electoral process as the key feature of                 democratic forms of government.                                                                                                                                 In this research, the investigators have generated a series of                  hypotheses regarding the role that elections play in the support                process.  To test these hypotheses, they conduct a three-stage panel            survey of a national sample of the Canadian electorate before, after,           and approximately one year after a national election that is being held         in November, 1988.  Of special importance, because of the panel design,         is the ability to measure individual change - - whether, and to what            extent, changes in support delineated in the first two waves of the             study persist over a longer period of time.                                                                                                                     This research is particularly promising because rarely does a specific          election provide as theoretically attractive a setting for studying             matters such as the manner in which elite representations of election           issues affect support levels, how people make politically relevant              economic judgments, and whether changes in the operative choice set             defined by major political parties influence the extent to which people         think in retrospective or prospective terms.",
