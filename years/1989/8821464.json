 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall aim if this research proposal is to define the                      molecular mechanisms involved in iron-mediated regulation of gene               expression in Escherichia coli, using the genes responsible for                 the biosynthesis (ent) and transport (fep, fes) of the catechol                 siderophore enterobactin as a model system.  We have isolated and               characterized six cistrons encoding enterobactin biosynthetic                   enzymes and seven genes specifying transport or iron release                    functions involving this siderophore, and we have defined two key               genetic regions which control the iron-mediated expression of                   this genetic system.  The objectives of the current study are:                  (i) to define the transcriptional boundaries of these iron-                     regulated genetic loci using nuclease protection and primer                     extension analyses: (ii) to determine (by site-directed                         mutagenesis of specially constructed fusion vectors) the precise                nucleotides controlling this inducible expression; (iii) to                     examine what role secondary structures in the characterized                     leader transcripts upstream of several iron-inducible genes might               play in post-transcriptional modulation of ent gene expression;                 (iv) to delineate protein-DNA interaction sites whereby the                     regulatory protein Fur mediates this control process, using in                  vitro and in vivo footprinting studies.                                                                                                                         This Expression as a complex metabolic pathway requiring                        regulatory coordination between biosynthetic and transport                      components.                                                                     Aside from its basic scientific interest, this control is                       significant in that in all organisms studied, from bacteria to                  man, the metabolic iron state of the organism regulates the                     degree of nutritive iron absorption.",
