S. scientists in the Third International                            Conference on Low Level Measurements of Actinides and                           Long-Lived Radionuclides in Biological and Environmental                        Samples, planned for January 29 to February 2nd, 1990 in                        Bambay, India.  The Indian organizer is Dr. Z.R. Turel of                       the Institute of Science, in Bombay.  The conference will                       discuss the follwoing subjects as related to the conference                     title:  Method of develolpment for measuring ultra low or                       low level actinides and long-lived radionuclides (RN),                          determination of the chemical speciations of the RN, macro                      and microdistrubution of RN in humans, environmental                            behavior of actinides and long lived RN, and quality                            control of their measurements.  Round table discussions                         will follow on these topics.  The full text of papers will                      be reviewed and submitted for publications in Journals                          dealing with this scientific area.                                                                                                                              Scope:  This is the third in a series of meetings that                          started in June of 1986 in Lund, Sweden.  The second was                        held in Akita City, Japan in May 1988.  These meetings deal                     with measuring low level RN to predict their behavior in                        the environment, intake and body distribution in humans,                        and with estimating the doses to aquatic and human                              populations.  Each of the first two meetings was attended                       by scientists from over 15 countries with some 40 invited                       papers which were published in the International Journal of                     Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry.  The third meeting,                      in Bombay, is planned to bring together investigators from                      many countries with interest in measurements of RN in a                         wide variety of environmental and biological samples                            including air, water, soil, and hard and soft tissue.",
