 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a study of preservable phytoplankton in                   sediment traps and cores from a transect across the northern                    California Current and Central Pacific Gyre.  Diatoms,                          silicoflagellates, dinoflagellates, and calcareous nannofossils                 will be quantified at the species or generic level in monthly                   and semi-monthly trap samples over a two year period.  The                      study will examine the spatial and temporal variability of                      production and flux from the highly productive and seasonally                   variable coastal zone to the oligotrophic gyre, and compare the                 seasonal input from the water column with the multi-year                        accumulation in the surface sediments.  Multivariate statistics                 will be used to describe the mixture of seasonal trap samples                   which best reflects the sediment assemblage; artificial changes                 in the trap data, such as increasing or removing certain taxa,                  can simulate the effects of dissolution, El Nino-like conditions,               and other processes not actually recorded in the traps.  The                    results of this comparison will permit a better understanding                   of the degree of information bias in the sediment record.  Once                 this question is resolved, the fossil record for the last                       glacial/interglacial cycle will be studied in cores from each                   site, thus extending the analysis of temporal variation in                      production to the geologic scale.                                               %%%                                                                             The preservation of silicieous microfossils preserved in                        sediment trap samples and in cores underneath the California                    Current and Central Pacific Gyre will be examined.  The                         temporal and spatial variability of flux of the siliceous                       components in the trap samples will be used to interpret the                    sedimentary record so that the effect of changes in climate on                  the oceanographic conditions in the region can be understood.                   This study will be done in conjunction with other researchers                   looking at many other variables in the trap and sediment                        samples.  These results will provide the most detailed picture                  of the controls on preservation of geologic material used to                    reconstruct paleoclimate that has been done in this region.",
