 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives here are to gain a better understanding of the                   mechanisms by which pyridine nucleotides function as coenzymes                  in dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation-reduction reactions and as                 substrates in NAD glycohydrolase-catalyzed hydrolyses and ADP-                  ribosylation reactions.  These studies will include the                         isolation and purification of pyridine nucleotide dependent                     enzymes, the investigation of chemical, physical and kinetic                    properties of these enzymes and studies of the binding                          processes involved in the proper orientation of substrates and                  products.  Structural analogs of the pyridine and nucleotides                   will be synthesized, chemically characterized, and applied in                   studies of selective interactions important to enzymic                          processes.  Some of these derivatives will be designed as                       fluorescent probes while others will be designed to function as                 site-labeling reagents or suicide substrates.  These studies                    will employ spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, titrimentry, liquid                 chromatography, and a number of general biochemical and                         chemical techniques.                                                                                                                                            The overall importance of coenzyme analogs as experimental                      tools for he study of many biochemical processes is                             well-documented.  The proposed new series of coenzyme analogs                   having unique properties will provide additional reagents                       applicable to biochemical studies.  In addition to the proposed                 use of these compounds to elucidate enzymic mechanisms involved                 in NAD metabolism in H. influenzae, these analogs should find an                even broader application in mechanistic studies of the many                     essential pyridine nucleotide-dependent enzymes.",
