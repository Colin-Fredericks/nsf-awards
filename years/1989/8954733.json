 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project will investigate the relationship between            conceptual understanding and problem-solving behavior in physics.  The          investigators will construct computational models of expert and naive-          student problem-solving skills (utilizing existing intelligent tutoring         system technology) and naive-student conceptions by analyzing protocol          data collected from students solving mechanics problems involving force         and motion and from individual student interviews about fundamental             physical concepts like force.  They will then build a mapping between           students' naive conceptions and the problem-solving skills which they           would acquire by applying those conceptions in various problem contexts.        The skill and concept models, and the mapping, will be used to build an         automated system capable of conceptual diagnosis of problem-solving             behavior.  This system will be used to construct individual student             models of skills and concepts.  The mapping will be validated by                comparing the system's conceptual diagnoses with results from accepted          diagnostic tests and student interviews.                                                                                                                        Several outcomes of this research will be:  a demonstration of the              impact of naive conceptions on physics problem-solving; a test of the           validity of using problem-solving behavior to identify naive physical           concepts; and an enhancement of existing frameworks of naive conceptions        of force and motion.  The results would be applicable to other domains          of physics.  Furthermore, the diagnostic technology would serve as a            means of collecting data that is often difficult or impractical (in most        classroom situations) to acquire.  As a classroom tool for teachers, the        system would help demonstrate the need for physics instruction to               address students' naive concepts.  Finally, the system could serve as           the diagnostic core of an intelligent tutoring system that would                diagnose and tutor on students' conceptual problems in physics.",
