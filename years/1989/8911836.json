 "awd_abstract_narration": "The construction and use of models aid the understanding                   of the real thing.  Computer models of the atmosphere lead to                   an understanding of various processes and their interactions.                   Furthermore, the results of models can identify parameters that                 are particularly important and suggest laboratory and field                     experiments that may clarify uncertainties.  As computing                       capabilities improve, more complex models can be constructed.                   Models generally grow from detailed box models to one-                          dimensional (altitude dependence), two-dimensional (altitude                    and latitude), and three-dimensional (altitude, latitude, and                   longitude) models in which physical and chemical detail is                      sacrificed for expanded spatial coverage, but the higher                        dimensional models are designed to  capture the essential                       features of the lower dimensional models.                                            Most models of atmospheric chemistry have been limited to                  gas phase chemistry.  They ignore the role of clouds and                        aerosol particles.  This project will develop numerical models                  of atmospheric chemistry to include these multimedia systems.                   The importance of these processes has been highlighted by the                   discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole which develops, in part,                  because of the presence of polar stratospheric clouds.  The                     long-range objective is to develop a three-dimensional                          photochemical model that includes the most useful features of                   the cloud/aerosol chemical models.",
