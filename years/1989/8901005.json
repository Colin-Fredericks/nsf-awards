 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of pelagic microzooplankton in food webs of the sea                    has been explored sketchily in field work.  Small, delicate                     organisms are difficult to isolate and study in the field                       situation.   One method of studying their role is to compare                    food chains of widely different marine environments.  The goal                  of this research program is to determine the relative                           importance of carbon transformation through the microbial loop                  of an oligotrophic and euptrophic oceanic community, including                  especially the consumers of bacterial biomass.  The hypothesis                  to be tested is that a greater percentage of the total amount                   of carbon fixed by primary productivity is consumed and                         respsired by heterotrophic microorganisms, i.e. bacteria and                    protozoa, in oceanic ecosystems than in coastal ecosystems.                     Primary productivity, bacterial productivity, and bactivory                     will be measured at a coastal site and a Sargasso Sea site                      during three cruises in the western North Atlantic.  The total                  amount of bacterial carbon produced and the percentage of                       primary production that this bacterial carbon represents will                   be determined in these oceanic environments and compared to the                 patterns of microbial carbon tranformation in two neritic                       environments, Chesapeake Bay and Vineyard Sound.  Size                          fractionation and single cell isolation studies of common                       species of larger protozoa and microm;etazoa will be performed                  using radiolabelled natural bacteria in order to identify the                   primary consumers of bacterial biomass in these communities.                    %%%                                                                             Much of the carbon produced in the sea is in the form of                        microorganisms too small to see or easily manipulate.  In                       recent years it has become clear that these organisms are quite                 crucial to the food chain of the seas from the poles to the                     equator.  One way to evaluate the importance of the                             microorganisms is to compare their growth rates in several                      different environments and to examine which organisms are able                  to feed on the microorganisms.  This study will measure rates                   of growth of several types of microorganisms in contrasting                     environments, the relatively impoverished Sargasso Sea and the                  relatively fertile Georges Bank.  It will also identify which                   organisms consume the bacteria.  The expectation is that                        microbial production is much more important in the food chain                   of the Sargasso Sea than it is in the Georges Bank area.",
