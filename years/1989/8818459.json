 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical tree-ferns are the only trees alive today that have               retained the primitive type of reproduction (by spores rather                   than by seeds) characteristic of the earliest land plants.  Tree                ferns of the Cyathea complex of species differ from other ferns                 in their lack of polyploidy (multiple sets of chromosomes) and by               the production of fertile, diploid hybrids. Drs. Diana Stein and                David Conant will construct a phylogeny or scheme of evolutionary               relationship for the tree-ferns to serve as a framework for                     analyzing speciation mechanisms in this group and to resolve                    conflicting taxonomies of the species and genera named thus far.                     Attempts by other scientists to construct phylogenies for                  the group have used morphological features (such as leaf scale                  characters) subject to convergent or parallel evolution.  Drs.                  Stein and Conant will examine variation in mutational                           differences in the chloroplast DNA of tree-ferns, to determine                  the pattern and direction of change among taxa.  Chloroplast                    mutational differences provide a more direct reflection of                      genetic divergence among species, and hold great promise for                    tracking the course of evolutionary change in these plants.",
