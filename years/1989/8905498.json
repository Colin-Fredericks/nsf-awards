 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore the possibility that afferent input to               developing brain regions provided by the natural environment during             neonatal periods contributes to neuroanatomical development.  It is             particularly interesting that some stimulation is provided unevenly to          developing males and females.  In rats, maternal stimulation                    associated with licking the pups is sexually biased, with males                 typically receiving more stimulation than females.  In this study,              maternal stimulation will be experimentally reduced and effects on              selected sexually dimorphic structures within the spinal cord and               brain of adults will be examined.  Measures will include number and             size of motor neurons in two spinal nuclei, volume and neural density           of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (POA),                   dendritic structure of Golgi-stained neurons in POA, and                        ultrastructural measurements of axonal number and size in the                   posterior fifth of the corpus callosum.                                                                                                                         Interactive activities include guest lectures to be given in several            different undergraduate psychology courses, research seminars and               discussions of research material in both structural and informal                settings.                                                                                                                                                       This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
