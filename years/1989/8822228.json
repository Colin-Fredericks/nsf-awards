 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under appropriate conditions of temperature, concentration and                  pressure, phospholipids organize into a variety of interesting and              potentially useful structures, including flat lamellae, elongated               rodlike structures, and closed vesicles.  These vesicles range in               dimension from hundreds of angstroms to tens of microns and consist of          bilayers separated by an aqueous medium.  A new structure composed of           a polymerizable diacetylenic phospholipid was recently discovered by a          joint Naval Research Laboratory/Geo-Centers group.  Below 39 C pieces           of bilayer assemble into straight, hollow tubules in a form similar to          a roll of aluminum foil.  A number of magneto-and electrooptic                  experiments are planned with these materials.  Cotton-Mouton                    measurements will be made on dilute suspensions of tubles in order to           better understand the molecular orientation with the tubule.  At                higher concentrations, birefringence and light scattering will be used          to determine the interparticle potential of tubules in suspension,              both the short and long range parts.  In addition, an attempt will be           made to locate a liquid crystal nematic phase which, if successful,             will be complemented with studies of the mechanical properties and              possible non-linear optical response.  Finally, a number of different           studies will be made involving tubule manipulation.",
