 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sm-Nd isotope systematics will be applied to Precambrian                   metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks in and adjacent to the                    Cheyenne Belt (CB), an ancient crustal suture zone in southern                  Wyoming, constrain models for the genesis of Proterozoic                        continental crust and for the accretion of these crustal segments               to the margins of preexisting Archean continental cratons.  The                 Cheyenne Belt represents a rare example of a well exposed Archean               continental margin in North America which is apparently not                     directly mantled by a large segment of \"mixed\" Proterozoic crust,               that is, crust produced in the Proterozoic that intermixed with                 Archean crustal material.  The proposal will center on                          determining whether the lack of such crust at the southern margin               of the Wyoming craton reflects the fact that such crust was never               accreted in this region (unlike other segments of Archean                       cratonal margins) or whether tectonic movement along the CB has                 removed and mixed crust that may have originally been present.                  Three separate, but interrelated projects will be undertaken 1)                 Sm-Nd isotope systematics of Proterozoic miogeoclinal sedimentary               rocks north of the CB.   The purpose will be to use the temporal                variations in the Nd isotopic compositions of these sediments to                determine whether Proterozoic island arcs composed of newly                     formed juvenile or \"mixed\" crustal material initially approached                the ancient continental margin, 2) Sm-Nd isotopic systematics of                para-and orthogneisses in tectonic blocks within the CB itself,                 to determine if these rocks represents  remnants of \"mixed crust                that might have initially accreted against the southern margin of               the Wyoming craton, and 3) the isotope systematics of Proterozoic               igneous and metasedimentary rocks of the Colorado province south                of the CB, to determine if \"mixed\" crust is present in the                      northernmost portions of this terrane, and to determine if the                  metasedimentary rocks record the isotopic characteristics                       (Archean or \"mixed\" crust) of the crust against which this                      terrane initially impinged.  The results of all three projects                  will be integrated with existing geologic and tectonic data in an               attempt to construct a model for the Precambrian tectonic                       evolution of the southern margin of the Wyoming Archean craton.",
