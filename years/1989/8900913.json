Undergraduates                  selected from a nation-wide group of applicants will conduct                    independent hands-on research for 9 weeks in the summer under                   direct supervision of staff scientists.  Working in their                       sponsors' laboratories, the students conduct original basic                     research on problems in mammalian genetics and development that                 are components of their sponsors' on-going research programs.                   Students thereby gain experience in all aspects of doing a                      research project from project design to reporting the results.                  Inbred and mutant laboratory mice are utilized in many projects.                All students are from outside the host institution; historically,               about half are from baccalaureate colleges, and two-thirds have                 been women.  Students with a wide range of science preparation                  are accepted, with each participant's research project tailored                 to his or her individual background and interests.  Several                     follow-up activities are in place to help maintain former                       students' interest in science and research.  Informal studies of                program alumni indicate that a high percentage receive doctoral                 degrees in the biological sciences or medicine.",
