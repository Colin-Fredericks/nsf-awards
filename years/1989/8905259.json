 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most organisms show circadian (circa=about; diem=day) rhythms in a              multitude of cellular functions and organismal behaviors.  A circadian          clock controls the biological timing mechanism coupling the physiology          and biochemistry of the organism to changes in the daily environmental          cycle, particularly light and temperature.  The coordinated action of           circadian rhythms is dependent on communication between cells and the           interpretation of signals from the environment (e.g. light).  In                contrast to the case in animal systems, little is known in plants about         the mechanism of the conversion of signals from the environment and             adjacent cells into cellular responses.  This project will continue             studies on how light reception and the circadian clock are coupled to           responses.  This research has implications for understanding of plant           responses to a variety of signals which are highly significant in plant         growth and development including stress, hormones, and gravity as well          as light.                                                                                                                                                       These studies involve two plant models.  The tropical legume Samanea            saman exhibits a circadian rhythm of leaflet movement while the single-         celled, flagellated alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibits a circadian         rhythm of phototaxis (movement in response to light).  Both rhythms are         controlled by a light-responsive circadian clock.  The hypothesis that          lipid metabolism is involved in mediating the effects of light and the          coordination of plant responses to the circadian clock will be tested.",
