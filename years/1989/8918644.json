New dating and                 paleoenvironmental methods developed by the Principal                           Investigator for rock varnish coatings, will permit radiometric                 age assignments and chronometric age-determinations of many                     previously undateable desert surfaces.  Chemical changes in                     surface coatings have been found to record systematic variations                in past levels of dust, alkalinity and photosynthetic pathways of               adjacent vegetation.  The next phase of research includes study                 of hillslope debris in humid-temperate environments and further                 development of rock varnish dating methods.  Understanding                      environmental changes depends on obtaining \"proxy\" records that                 are both dateable and ubiquitous.  Desert varnish and slope                     colluvium deposits hold great promise to provide important                      information for paleoenvironmental reconstruction of past events                in both semi-arid and humid environments.",
