 "awd_abstract_narration": "Savanna baboons represent a group of closely related populations                living across subsaharan Africa outside the tropical rain forest.               Scientists do not agree whether they comprise one or several                    species because, although they are very similar morphologically,                populations differ significantly in social characteristics.  For                the analysis of primate social organization and its relationship                to humans, savanna baboons are thus excellent subjects.  In order               to understand the social relationships among individuals in such                a population, it is necessary to know who are the parents of                    individual infants.  Previous studies have been hampered by                     knowing only who is the mother each infant.                                                                                                                     Previous long-term field observations of this population by the                 Principal Investigator have resulted in knowing all individuals                 behaviorally.  Maternity is known, but paternity--based on                      behavioral observations--is only assumed.  In this study genetic                studies (paternity tests) will also determine who the father is                 of each infant.  These genetic studies will test the hypothesis                 that such behavioral father (based on observations of the                       animals) is also the genetic father.                                                                                                                            As a result of this study it will be possible to test a variety                 of behavioral questions such as: whether inbreeding and incest                  occur; whether paternal certainty is related to protection from                 infanticide; and, whether male access to alpha status is related                to the status of his father.",
