 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern microscopy techniques (phase contrast and epifluorescence                microscopy) will enhance laboratory training and research in                    microbiology.  Laboratory exercises will emphasize both techniques and          application.  Applications of phase contrast include identification of          morphologically distinct groups of microorganisms in environmental              samples, observations of microbial motility, and direct counts of               microorganisms.  Applications of epifluorescence microscopy include use         of fluorescently labeled antibodies for identification and                      quantification of specific groups of microorganisms, and direct counts          of microorganisms in environmental samples by acridene orange and               fluorescein diacetate staining.  The microscopy equipment and training          gained by students will facilitate new experimentation in ongoing               undergraduate research projects involving soil microbiology,                    chemolithotropic bacteria, and biological ice nucleation.                                                                                                       The school will provide 50% matching funds.",
