 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to develop new stabilization techniques for                 immobilized enzymes used in bioreactors.  These techniques, which have          been demonstrated to significantly stabilize an enzyme to storage at            elevated temperatures, will be further developed and                            applied to stabilization of functioning immobilized enzymes as                  used in bioreactors.  The rationale is to provide an environment                for optimal stability surrounding the enzyme, then to bind it                   together by copolymerization to obtain a very large molecular                   weight but soluble enzyme derivative.  The crosslinked enzyme will              then be immobilized and tested for stability.                                                                                                                   The enzyme to be stabilized in the above manner during the Phase I              project is beta-galactosidase.  This enzyme is used in bioreactors              to hydrolyze lactose in milk or whey to make dairy products usable              by people with lactose intolerance, or to make a waste product of               the cheese industry into a useful product.",
