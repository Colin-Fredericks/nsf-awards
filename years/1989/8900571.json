 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at Kent               State University to recommence a Research Experience for                        Undergraduates Site.  Eight Junior-class level participants will                be supported.  One of these will be a Kent State student, while                 the remaining seven will be selected from nominees provided by                  specified liberal-arts colleges in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West                  Virginia.  Designated faculty members from the psychology                       Departments of collaborating institutions have agreed to serve as               project coordinators to assist in the initiation, organization,                 and follow-up of student research activity associated with                      program operation.                                                                                                                                              Student selection involves nomination by home faculty and a                     familiarization visit to Kent for interview and introduction of                 project opportunities.  Fourteen topics are available for choice                with the restriction that advisors and students be matched one-                 to-one.  Competitively selected awardees work with their                        individual advisor and engage in training, travel to other                      institutions, and informational exchange with other participants                during ten summer weeks.  Follow-up of analysis and reporting                   will be monitored by the Project Director and local coordinators                during the ensuing Fall term.",
