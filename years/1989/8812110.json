 "awd_abstract_narration": "Early embryonic development is thought to be mediated by                   determinants present in the egg cytoplasm, but these substances                 have yet to be characterized.  In this proposal we continue our                 studies on cytoplasmic determinants involved in endodermal                      alkaline phosphatase (AP), muscle and embryonic axis development                in the ascidian Styela.  The possibility that AP determinants                   consist of maternal AP mRNAs, which are localized in the egg and                translationally activated after segregation to the endodermal                   cells will be examined by in situ hybridization with a cloned AP                probe.  The spatial distribution of muscle and axial determinants               will be examined by UV microbeam irradiation of the egg and                     microsurgical deletion of cells from the early embryo.  The                     general class of molecules to which the muscle and axial                        determinants belong will be investigated using a combination of                 UV action spectrum analysis and a bioassay involving                            microinjection of fractionated cytoplasmic components of normal                 eggs into eggs whose ability to develop axis or muscle has been                 impaired by localized UV irradiation.  The potential role in axis               determination of a maternal mRNA encoding a 25 kd protein, a                    component that is absent in axis deficient embryos, will also be                investigated by UV irradiation and in vitro translation.  It is                 anticipated that new information will be obtained concerning the                localization and identity of determinants involved in three                     different developmental decisions.                                              %%%                                                                                  One of the most important mechanisms regulating the control                of early embryogenesis is the segregation of developmental                      information, \"determinants\" or \"morphogens,\" to various regions                 of the embryo during early development.  It is believed that                    these morphogens determine the fate of specific cell lineages and               guide them to differentiate into their final tissue such as                     muscle, nerve and gut.  The molecular nature of these                           determinants has not yet been determined.  Dr. Jeffery has made                 important contributions to this area and is now on the verge of                 identifying those molecules necessary for muscle and gut                        development as well as for the establishment of the dorsal-                     ventral axis itself.",
