 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project in                           biochemistry  between Biserka Kojic-Prodic of the Rudjer                        Boskovic Institute in Zagreb and William L. Duax of the                         Medical Foundation of Buffalo, the investigators will study                     the regulatory action of a plant growth hormone, auxin (or                      idoleacetic acid), at the whole plant, cellular and                             molecular levels.  Compounds and deriatives of idoleacetic                      acid will be synthesized or isolated from natural sources;                      analyzed for structural and chemical properties, and                            correlated with the plant's biological activity.  The                           Yugoslav group is particularly expert at synthesis and                          structural analysis while the U.S. group is reknown for its                     work in structure-activity chemistry.  The research is                          significant and is expected to yield new information about                      receptors, enzymes, and the structure of auxin and its                          relationship to hormonal activity, in particular.                                                                                                               This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution  in Yugoslavia, but                        include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
