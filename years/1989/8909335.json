 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the development of a force feedback                      control scheme for dexterous robot masters in telemanipulation                  systems.  Robot telemanipulation may be viewed as the remote                    control of partially intelligent machines where continuous on                   line monitoring and control of a robot slave device is provided                 by a master under operator control.  Such systems are designed to               protect humans from potentially dangerous environments, i.e.,                   radiation chambers, outer space or munitions dumps.  The coupling               between master and slave may be either mechanical or electrical.                When, as in most modern systems, the linkage is electrical,                     performance degrades due to less natural control.  Performance                  improvement is possible with a master which is more natural to                  control.  A dexterous or multifingered replica of the human hand                is such a system.  However, current designs provide no force                    feedback.  This research tests the use of Shape Memory Metals                   (SMM) actuators to bring force feedback to the operator fingers.                It comprises several tasks including mathematical modeling and                  experimental testing of different types of SMM actuators,                       building a prototype dexterous master, designing the interface                  between the master and the control computer, integrating the                    master with the host computer, and integrating the master/host                  computer with the remote robot.  This research advances                         engineering knowledge of dexterous force feedback and has                       numerous applications in space, military, energy, and medical                   sectors.  It could improve efficiency of telemanipulation systems               and expand their capabilities to address more complex tasks.",
