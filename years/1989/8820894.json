 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to answer as directly as                      possible three closely related questions: (1) What is the cosmic                origin of lithium?  (2) Beginning soon after the big bang, how                  has the Galactic lithium abundance varied?  (3a) During the main                sequence lifetimes of stars with less than one Solar mass, what                 mechanism progressively and strongly destroys the atmospheric                   lithium which is initially present? and (3b) What presumably                    distinct mechanism similarly destroys lithium in a very narrow                  stellar mass range.  Dr. Hobbs will measure a lithium line from                 stars in open stellar clusters, from hot, metal.poor dwarf stars,               and from stars in the very young cluster NGC 2264.                                                                                                              The origin and evolution of the element lithium has in recent                   years reemerged as an important and challenging problem in                      astrophysics.  The problem impacts the discipline of cosmology                  through its connection to the process of nucleosynthesis in the                 big bang formation of the Universe.  It has now become imperative               to obtain, from observational data, information on the evolution                of the abundance of lithium over the history of our Galaxy.",
