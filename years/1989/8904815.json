 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                    Information Management Research at the Georgia Institute of                     Technology in collaboration with the University of Arizona will                 support research that integrates information system concepts into               end-user computing research.  It will emphasize the application of              information systems theory to the current and future business and               government environments.  It will promote the integration of                    advanced information technologies in storage, retrieval,                        transmission, etc., with traditional information systems, and                   develop a framework for the management of information systems                   which is consistent with the organizations' management systems.                      This Center was coordinated with Dr. Stephen Wolff, Division               of Networking and Communications Research and Infrastructure.                        The Program Manager recommends that the Georgia Institute of               Technology in collaboration with the University of Arizona be                   awarded $200,000 each year of a five-year continuing grant.  The                Army Institute for Research and Management Information                          Communications and Computer Sciences (AIRMICS) is providing a                   $100,000 per year to co-sponsor the Center.                                          Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                  and/or the Director of The Engineering Centers Division will                    review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal                        criteria, including the following: (1) extent to which                          university/industry interaction and collaboration is developing;                (2) extent to which the support base for the center is expanding;               (3) extent to which a robust research program is developing.  If                review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support              of the next period of this continuing grant.",
