 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed here comprises an integrated study of                metamorphic and associated felsic plutonic rocks in the multiply                deformed and polymetamorphosed southwestern New England terrane.                The goal of this project is to use this classic Appalachian                     terrane to characterize the petrologic and thermal processes                    resulting from the tectonic overthickening that accompanied the                 Taconian (Ordovician) collisional event described in tectonic                   models of western New England.  The study will also provide a                   detailed picture of Acadian (Devonian) thermal evolution in the                 eastern portion of the southwestern New England highlands.  Most                important, our efforts will also be concentrated on examining the               exact nature of the overprinting of later on earlier                            metamorphisms in the zone of overlap between the Taconian and                   Acadian events.  The techniques we intend to use include:                       quantitative geothermobarmometry based on mineral chemical                      analyses by electron microprobe, to determine fluid-rock inter-                 action histories and to help constrain uplift histories; argon                  isotopic analysis of key minerals to deduce temperature-time                    evolution of key areas.  Because our emphasis in applying our                   results is in determining the evolution of an orogenic belt, the                study is focussed on three geographic areas:  southwestern                      Connecticut and adjacent southeastern New York where we can                     document predominantly Taconian metamorphic effects; the central                and eastern belt of the western highlands where the                             polymetamoprhic overlap is best displayed.",
