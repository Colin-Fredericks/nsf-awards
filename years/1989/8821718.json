The meeting involves                        approximately 150 participants representing a large geographical                distribution.  The renowned lecturer will present a summary of                  recent advances concerning their particular peptide area                        emphasizing its role in the regulation of reproductive                          neuroendocrine function.  The objective is to integrate the                     presentations to formulate hypotheses about the sites and                       mechanisms of action/interactions of these neuropeptide\u001as\u001a in                   carrying out their regulatory action.  The results and discussion               will provide important information concerning the central                       mechanisms of neuroendocrine regulation and will define clear                   directions for future research in this area.  This valuable                     information could lead towards the development of novel                         therapeutic regimens for treating clinical reproductive                         dysfunctions associated with aberrant reproductive hormone                      secretion.  The proceedings from the meeting will be published in               a book.                                                                         \u001a***",
