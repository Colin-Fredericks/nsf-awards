The objective of this                       project is to encourage capable high school students to elect                   a career in engineering by exposing them to the many exciting                   facets of the engineering profession.  The program targets                      the entire nation giving special emphasis to underrepresented                   groups such as minorities, the disabled, and women.  The                        program covers all engineering fields but focuses on                            electrical and mechanical engineering.  During the two-week                     long intensive program students are immersed in engineering                     activities.  The participate in active discussions on the                       engineering career, on professional ethics, view engineers at                   work at an industrial firm and a governmental agency, learn                     how to use the computer as the engineer's preeminent tool,                      and practice engineering analysis and design using the                          engineering method.  The Academy period provides added                          dimension to the program by allowing extra help for those                       needing it, honors work for the truly gifted and one-on-one                     career counseling for.  Significant follow-up activities                        continue to provide motivation and guidance for the                             participants until they have been accepted in an engineering                    program.  The results of this program can serve as a national                   template for others to use.",
