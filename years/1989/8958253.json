 "awd_abstract_narration": "In support of his research activities over a five-year period,                  Dr. Scott A. Wissinger of the Departments of Biology and                        Environmental Sciences at Allegheny College (Pennsylvania) will                 receive Presidential Young Investigator Award funding.  This work               concerns complex biotic interactions at the interface of                        population ecology and community ecology.  Specifically, the                    focus of the investigations is on multi-species competition,                    predation, and habitat selection processes among fish and                       dragonfly (Odonata) larvae in North American ponds.  By                         manipulating replicate artificial ponds, effects of invading,                   migratory, large dragonflies on the resident smaller dragonfly                  species will be studied.  Select undergraduate students,                        particularly seniors, at Allegheny College will have the                        opportunity to participate in this research.                                                                                                                    The second focus of the research addresses effects of acid                      precipitation on pond community structure; the study sites are a                series of pristine high altitude (at 3500 meters) ponds located                 within  the Nature Conservancy's Mexican Cut Nature Reserve near                the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (Gunnison, Colorado).                  Initially, surveys will be made to assess the relationship                      between alkalinity, and salamander (the top vertebrate predator)                and invertebrate abundance.  Results will then be used to design                experiments for separating effects on prey from effects on                      predators.                                                                                                                                                      This award of funding will enable the investigator to complete                  development of an experimental pond facility, purchase                          maintenance and sampling equipment, and facilitate travel by                    personnel to remote study sites.",
