 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hampel will characterize a novel catalytic RNA/substrate                    RNA complex - the proposed \"hairpin.\"  The catalytic complex                    consists of a short catalytic RNA of 50 bases of satellite                      sequence and a substrate RNA of 14 bases of satellite                           sequences.  The catalytic RNA cleaves the substrate at an ApG                   bond with a Km=0.03uM and kcat=2.1/min in the presence of                       12mM MgC12, 40mM Tris pH=7.5 at 37C which, under these mild                     conditions, is the most active RNA catalysis known.  The                        model will be tested by site-directed mutagenesis, structure-                   specific nuclease digestion, and large scale RNA chemical                       synthesis such that others can analyze the catalytic                            RNA/substrate complex by NMR and X-ray crystallography.                                                                                                         The research area of this proposal is currently creating                        considerable interest, not only because of its importance in                    the replication of certain plant pathogens, but also because                    of this fundamental importance in contributing to our                           understanding of RNA catalysis and the RNA world.  So far                       there appear to be three types of autolytically cleaving                        RNAs.  The best characterized to date is the \"hammerhead\"                       structure associated with one viroid, one or more virusoids,                    and an RNA transcript of newt DNA.  The one described here is                   another where a different active structure appears likely.                      The third is that of the hepatitis B delta factor RNA, where                    a third type of structure is probable.",
