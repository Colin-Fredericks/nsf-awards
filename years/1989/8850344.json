 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Missouri Botanical Garden proposes to improve its program of                informal environmental education through major renovation of the                exhibits in its Climatron, a public conservatory that features displays         on plant specimens of the tropical rain forests.  The purpose is to             increase public literacy in environmental science, with the focus on            severely threatened tropical biomes.  Along with renovation of the              exhibits there also will be full revision of tours, courses,                    instructional packages and teacher training where they relate to                tropical ecology or use the Climatron as a teaching resource.  Funding          from the NSF will support portions of two years of salaries for three           Education Division staff who will devote 50% of their time to                   developing adjunct interpretation for use in the Climatron, for                 production costs of four of the five science exhibits, and for all              other new interpretive signs.  The MBG will assume all remaining costs          from a combination of its operating and campaign budgets.",
