 "awd_abstract_narration": "The control of the synthesis, assembly and segregation of distinct         surface domains in a model unicellular system will be addressed in this         proposed  study.  In Euglena a surface fraction and its subfractions            enriched in plasma membranes and membrane skeletons will be                     independently evaluated and compared with a flagellar fraction that             lacks or differs in these components.  First surface isolates will be           used to resolve the dynamics of attachment of the membrane skeleton to          the plasma membrane by calculating turnover rates of the membrane               skeletal proteins and by detailing the behavior of unassembled cellular         pools of these proteins.  Secondly, to what extent the membrane skeletal        proteins themselves determine surface organization will be evaluated in         experiments in which proteins with slightly different biochemical               properties but markedly different assembly patterns are separately or in        combination reassociated on plasma membranes.  In a third set of                experiments the significance of a relatively minor membrane skeletal            protein that shares immunological determinants with spectrin will be            assessed by peptide mapping, overlay experiments and cloning.                   Fourthly, in order to gain a fuller understanding of the timing of              synthesis and assembly of replicating surfaces and regenerating                 flagella, molecular probes will be constructed for specific integral and        peripheral membrane proteins.  Recombinant from a cDNA library in the           expression vector, Agt11 have yielded clones tentatively identified as          coding for cell surface-specific proteins, a flagellar specific protein         as well as a and B tubulins.  Clones will be further confirmed, recloned        and restriction mapped.  Sequencing of the cDNA coding for an integral          membrane protein will be given first priority as this protein appears to        be a putative membrane skeletal anchor restricted to the cell surface.          It is anticipated that DNA probes derived from sequences specific for           proteins of the cell surface or the flagellar surface will be useful            ultimately for isolating genomic clones and examining upstream regions          for sequences common to genes coding for proteins targeted to either of         those two domains.                                                                   The results of these experiments will significantly increase our           understanding of how membrane domains are maintained, and how cell              surface components interact with components of the cellular interior.",
