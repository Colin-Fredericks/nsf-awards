 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work includes the development of computational methods for                 studying the electronic states in condensed matter and to carry                 out calculations for real solids and liquids.  This is part of a                long-range program to understand and predict physical properties                of condensed matter from the fundamental equations for the                      electrons and nuclei.  The work will lead to timely advances                    based upon recent developments in the field, making use of ideas                and computational methods built up by the authors and co-workers,               in particular, quantum Monte Carlo and density functional                       techniques.  The former can in principle calculate exact                        properties of many-body systems, but its applications to                        condensed matter have been thus far limited.  The latter is                     simpler and is accurate for the ground state properties of                      certain classes of materials.  The main thrust of the proposal is               to combine these two complementary approaches to enhance both the               scope of the methods and their accuracies.  An integral part of                 the program is to apply the developments to problems with direct                connections to experimental physics and materials science--both                 to test the methods and to understand and predict experimentally                relevant properties.  Examples include properties of new                        materials such as superlattices, liquid and amorphous systems,                  and correlated electronic states in magnetic insulators, heavy                  fermion systems, and the new oxide superconductors.//",
