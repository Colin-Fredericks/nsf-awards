 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to test the hypothesis                that reduction in size of the olfactory system of the brain in                  higher primates has been accompanied by a significant                           reorganization at the cellular level.  Such reorganization could                have allowed some animals previously considered to be microsmatic               (having a poor sense of smell)--including humans--to have highly                discriminative olfactory systems despite their small size.  The                 Principal Investigators will conduct a quantitative analysis of                 neurons of the olfactory system, their arrangement, and their                   interconnections in the brains of several primates and other                    mammals.  The animals to be used in this research are to be                     received from other investigators and this therefore represents a               judicious use of a valuable resource.                                                                                                                           This research addresses a fundamental question of interest to                   those involved with either olfactory behavior or anatomy; namely,               why do some animals, sensitive to olfactory cues and with                       seemingly complex social behavioral patterns, have what appear to               be diminutive olfactory structures?  Anthropologists have                       traditionally believed that the olfactory system in primates has                been reduced at the expense of development of the visual system.                This research could demonstrate that long-held tenet of                         anthropology to be misleading if reorganization of the olfactory                system has allowed a small \"smell-brain\" to be just as efficient                in some respects as a large one.",
