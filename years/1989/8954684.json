 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two major reports calling for substantial revision in K-12 mathematics          teaching were issued during the 1988-89 school year.  The National              Council of Teachers of Mathematics issued \"Curriculum and Evaluation            Standards for School Mathematics\" and the Mathematical Sciences                 Education Board issued \"Everybody Counts\". These reports indicate a             national critical need to (1) broaden the understanding of leaders of           the mathematics education community in the United States of the                 underlying reasons for making changes in mathematics curricula, (2)             develop state and national networks for the dissemination of information        about the reforms proposed in the two reports, and (3) cultivate a more         positive and conducive environment across the country for making changes        in mathematics education.                                                                                                                                       In order to increase the likelihood of implementing the reforms called          for in these documents, the Association of State Supervisors of                 Mathematics will institute a reform program beginning with six regional         conferences for 900 leaders in mathematics education strategically              distributed across the country.  These conferences will (1) address the         content implications and recommendations contained within the two               reports, (2) develop teams of regionally networked leaders to serve as          change promoters within their states, (3) develop a set of project              materials to include the major mathematics reform documents and                 speakers' kits to be distributed to each conference participant, and (4)        organize a range of follow-up activities to ensure that these leaders           become involved in the local dissemination and implementation of the            recommendations.                                                                                                                                                Cost sharing by the partners will total 100% of the National Science            Foundation funding.",
