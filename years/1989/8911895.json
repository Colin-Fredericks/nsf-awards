 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is directed towards the development of robust,               efficient numerical methods and software for solving large stiff                systems of ordinary differential equations.  Of particular interest are         systems that result from the semi-discretization of parabolic and mixed         type partial differential equations, for example, the equations that            model reaction diffusion convection processes.  The effort will require         the development of preconditioned iterative methods for large                   structured systems of linear and nonlinear algebraic equations.                 Algorithms and software will be designed to take advantage of shared            memory multiprocesor/vector computer hardware.  Moreover, algorithms            and software will be suitable for use on a wide range of computers.             The effort if successful will provide mathematical software that will           facilitate computer modelling and simulation in various scientific and          engineering fields.  The numerical methods and software developed will          extend the capability to solve an important class of partial                    differential equations.",
