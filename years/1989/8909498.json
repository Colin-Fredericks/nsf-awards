 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are a) to develop Coordinate Rotation           Algorithms (CORDIC) using complex arithmetic; b) to develop a fault             tolerant Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) array architecture; and c)          to develop the VLSI implementation of a fixed-point CORDIC SVD                  processor-array element.  The principal investigator has previously             shown the applicability of high-speed computer arithmetic algorithms,           which includes the mapping of CORDIC to the SVD of real matrix.  Based          on the CORDIC data path chips designed, fully custom CMOS chips are             being fabricated through the MOSIS service.  The data path designs are          then combined to yield a complete array-element chip and configured             into a prototype array.  Improvements to numerical algorithms will lead         to a CORDIC SVD processor using complex arithmetic.                                                                                                             Recent advances in VLSI have encouraged the development of special-             purpose processor arrays to solve computation-intensive numerical               algorithms.  SVD is an important matrix computational method for real-          time signal processing and image processing.  The results developed             here will result in a custom, low-cost, reconfigurable, high-speed VLSI         SVD array, which will allow many applications to be solvable in real            time.",
