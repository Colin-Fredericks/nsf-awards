 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is in the general area of Analytical and Surface                  Chemistry and in the subfield of chemistry studied by mass                      spectrometry. The focus of the proposed research is to study                    the mechanisms of Chemical Ionization (CI) reactions through                    detection of the neutral products of the ion/molecule reactions                 using the variation of ratios of sample ions in CI mass spectra                 as functions of electron current and source pressure. Such                      studies should prove useful for examining structural features                   for certain classes of compounds. Sample ion/sample molecule                    reactions will also be studied.In addition, the proton                          affinities of complex molecules will be determined since they                   are difficult to determine by other techniques, are not readily                 available, and should prove useful in choosing selective CI                     reagents for quantitative analyses. Comparisons will be made                    between experimental and calculated relative sensitivities of                   complex molecules in CI mass spectrometry.                                                                                                                      This research will investigate chemical methods of generating                   ions for improved analysis using mass spectrometry. The                         fundamental chemistry involved in generating such ions will be                  examined in detail. These studies may provide reaction                          prediction capabilities for certain classes of compounds. The                   propensity of complex molecules to associate with the hydrogen                  ion will be examined. The results of these experiments will be                  compared to theory.",
