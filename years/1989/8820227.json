 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ocean Engineering Department at Woods Hole Oceanographic                    Institution will undertake an instrumentation and technology                    development project to design and construct an unmanned,                        untethered vehicle for performing and servicing long-term                       deep ocean benthic experiments.  This vehicle has been named                    ABE for the Autonomous Benthic Explorer.  Design criteria                       call for it to be launched from any oceanographic research                      ship and be able to remain on site for several months.                          During this time span it must periodically move about in its                    acoustic navigation net, taking pictures and making a variety                   of scientific measurements.  At the end of its mission, it is                   to be recovered on command.                                                                                                                                     ABE will complement and extend the capabilities of manned                       submersibles, particularly DSV ALVIN, as well as remotely                       operated, tethered systems such as ARGO/JASON.  These systems                   will still be required for initial surveys and installations.                   However, ABE shall have the ability to remain at a deep sea                     research site for long periods or to return to a previously                     surveyed site to observe changes.  The instrumentation                          development project is in anticipation of planned research                      initiatives requiring long-term observations of seafloor                        features such as hydrothermal vents and mid-ocean ridges.",
