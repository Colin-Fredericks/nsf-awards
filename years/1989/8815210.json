 "awd_abstract_narration": "The movement of genes via pollen among plants within                       populations and between plant populations is poorly understood.                 In addition, little is known of the way ecological factors affect               pollinator and pollen movement.  Quantification of pollen                       movement is necessary for understanding the evolutionary dynamics               of natural populations.  In a more practical context, an                        understanding of pollen movement is critical if we are to assess                how to best preserve genetic diversity in populations of                        endangered species.  Understanding the movement of genes via                    pollen will also help us assess the inherent dangers (and                       benefits) of \"introduced\" genes in agricultural plants and trees.                    Previous measures of pollen flow relied primarily on                       pollinator observations and on the dispersal of unique markers                  from selected plants in an experimental setting.  These methods                 have serious drawbacks, and may not accurately assess pollen                    movement.  A statistical technique--paternity analysis--                        developed for cases of questionable human paternity and only                    recently adapted to plant populations--allows refinement of the                 measurement of effective pollen movement.  Paternity analysis                   will be used to accurately assess pollen movement in a natural                  and an experimental population of the legume Lathyrus latifolius.               This plant was chosen for its level of genetic variation and ease               of experimental manipulation.  The effects of plant density and                 distance on pollen movement can thus be more easily measured.                   This study is one of the first attempts to analyze in detail                    factors affecting gene movement via pollen under controlled                     conditions, and to integrate the experimental data with                         descriptions of pollen movement patterns in a natural population.",
