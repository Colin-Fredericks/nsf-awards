 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in polymers                            to be conducted by Harry Frisch of the Research                                 Foundation of New York (SUNY-Albany) and Glaucione de                           Barros of the Federal University of Ceara in                                    Fortaleza, Brazil.  They will study novel methods of                            polymer modification by the formation of                                        interpenetrating polymer networks.  Such networks                               could result in more valuable modified natural                                  polymers with significantly enhanced physical                                   properties.  Improved mechanical properties of natural                          rubber such as increased strength, frictional and                               impact resistance will be sought in work that requires                          little sophisticated equipment or materials. For                                example, ionic or electrical conductivity can be                                improved by suitable material doping.  Network                                  composites made of carnauba wax can produce a material                          of lower crystallinity.                                                                                                                                         This collaboration represents an excellent fit between                          the research interests of the investigators.                                    Additionally, the proposed interaction between them                             will result in new graduate programs for students at                            both institutions. The project is expected to result                            in a new polymer research capability in Brazil and in                           substitute products from natural sources, of mutual                             benefit as petroleum supplies become scarce or prices                           rise.",
