 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of mobile elements in maize have made considerable                      progress in the past few years with the isolation and cloning                   of several elements and subsequent cloning of a number of                       genes.  This progress is a result of the combined efforts of                    molecular biologists working closely with geneticists.  Early                   results have elucidated the general structure of the                            elements, their component parts, and their genetic effects.                     This work has generated the development of models to explain                    the role of these elements inducing changes in the genome as                    well as in individual genes.  This project is designed to                       (a) analyze in En system by isolating mutants controlling the                   several specific functions of the En element, (b) pursue the                    genetic analysis of mutable alleles at the C1, C2, A1, A2,                      Bz, P, and Wx loci in order to isolate mutant derivatives for                   additional molecular studies, (c) further the studies of the                    Cy and Uq systems, (d) analyze corn breeding populations for                    the distribution of mobile elements, and (e) trap master                        elements at cloned loci for their use in tagging genes.                                                                                                         One of the most important developments in modern genetics has                   been the discovery that chromosomes do not have fixed, static                   structures, but rather that genes can move from place to                        place on the chromosomes.  The mobility of genes was first                      demonstrated in corn by Barbara McClintock in the 1950s, and                    independently by Dr. Peterson not long afterwards.  Beginning                   in the 1970s a large number of investigators began to                           discover that mobile genes are very widespread in nature; we                    now know that they are found in almost all species of living                    organism.  Beginning in the late 1970s a number of                              investigators began to study at the molecular level the                         mechanisms by which genes move.  Dr. Peterson has had a very                    productive collaboration with Dr. Heinz Saedler (Cologne,                       FRG) which has resulted in many important contributions to                      our understanding of these mechanisms.  This award will allow                   Dr. Peterson to continue this collaboration.  The mobility of                   genes has immensely important consequences for the lives of                     individual organisms, as well as for the evolutionary history                   of populations.  Beyond their intrinsic scientific                              importance, mobile genetic elements have formed the backbone                    of many methods of critical importance for biotechnology.",
