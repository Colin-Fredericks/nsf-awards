 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the econometric analysis of choices             made by individuals or firms.  In the case of an individual choosing            among a discrete set of alternatives (such as what mode of                      transportation to take to work, whether to buy a house, etc.), a well-          established approach is the model of stochastic utility maximization.           In that approach, the utility or other objective function associated            with each alternative is modelled as a parametric function of observed          variables, plus a stochastic component which represents the effects of          unobserved quantities, such as unmeasured attributes of the alternative         and taste of the individual.  Specifying a joint probability                    distribution of these stochastic components then leads to a choice              probability model.  For discrete choice, the standard models of this            type include the probit, logit, and generalized extreme-value models.                                                                                           The principal focus of this project is the extension of these methods           from discrete choice to continuous choice.  Examples of continuous              choice include time of day decisions (such as when to start a trip from         home to work, when to make a phone call, or when to send out a                  shipment) and decisions involving geographic coordinates (such as where         to locate a new facility within a metropolitan area).  This extension           involves considerable theoretical and practical difficulties, and has           received much less attention in the research literature than has                discrete choice modelling.  The project is important because, first, it         should result in a better understanding of the econometric theory               associated with the maximization of stochastic processes.  Secondly the         study should lead to an improved understanding of the tradeoffs and             other factors involved when individuals, firms, or institutions make            decisions about geographic location and about the timing of economic            activities.",
