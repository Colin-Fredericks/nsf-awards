 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the current uncertainty regarding the nature and                   mechanisms of forest succession is a consequence of the paucity                 of long-term data sets, particularly those dealing with the                     patterns of establishment, growth, and mortality of individual                  plants.  Measurements of long-term data sets in the Duke Forest,                North Carolina will be continued under the aegis of the Long-Term               Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) program.  These data                  sets include: 1. Permanent Sample Plots (PSPs).  These plots were               established between 1931 and 1947 in stands representing an array               of site conditions and successional stages.  Individual trees in                these 51 permanent plots have since been censused and measured at               roughly 5-year intervals.  These data will be used to examine                   long-term changes in tree growth and mortality, 2.  Intensive                   Seedling and Sapling Plots.  In these plots, established in                     stands representing an array of site and successional conditions                in 1977, mapped individual seedlings have been censused annually.               Monitoring of intensive plots in thinning- and transition-stage                 pines, and hardwood stands will continue.  The sampling protocol                will include sapling populations.  These data will facilitate                   studies of mechanisms of transition from even-aged pine to                      uneven-aged hardwood forests, as well as long-term trends in                    seedling and sapling demography, 3. Mapped Forest Plots.                        Permanent mapped forest plots representing transition pine-                     hardwood stands and hardwood stands will be resampled.  These                   data will be used to address a variety of a questions related to                successional changes in pattern and stand structure.",
