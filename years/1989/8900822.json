(1) Suppose X is a                 compact subset of the PL 4-manifold M.  Under what conditions                   does X have arbitrarily close neighborhoods which collapse to                   1-dimensional spines?  (2) Suppose F is a closed surface and W                  has the homotopy type of F.  Does there exist a topological                     imbedding of F into W which is a homotopy equivalence?  (3)                     Under what natural additional hypotheses can one prove that two                 compacta imbedded in a manifold have homeomorphic complements                   if and only if they have the same shape?  (4) Is the                            approximation theorem valid for codimension two imbeddings of                   any manifolds other than k-cells?                                                    These questions and others point to basic deficiencies in                  our understanding of very natural geometric  objects, namely                    topological and PL-manifolds, even in low dimensions.  Such                     manifolds arise in physics as the solutions of ordinary and                     differential equations set in the 4-dimensional space-time in                   which we live.",
