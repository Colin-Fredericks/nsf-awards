 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Organic Dynamics Program provides support for                 the continuing research of Dr. Paul Engel of Rice University.                   The main thrust of the research is a study of the chemistry of                  azoalkanes and the transient intermediates formed in their                      thermal and photochemical decomposition. This chemistry will be                 approached on a broad front.                                                                                                                                    Several different approaches to understanding the behavior of                   transient intermediates will be undertaken. The mechanism of                    bond-breaking in azoalkanes will be investigated by nanosecond                  transient absorption experiments. The effect of azoalkane                       structure on the cation-radicals formed by one-electron                         oxidation will be studied by flash photolysis of azoalkanes                     with electron-deficient sensitizers. Thermolysis kinetics and                   mass spectroscopic measurements will be used to determine the                   stabilization energies of a series of carbon-centered free                      radicals containing alpha-nitrogen functionality. Biradical                     lifetimes will be \"clocked\" by generation and rearrangement of                  cyclopropylcarbinyl radical centers. It is expected that these                  varied studies will lead to new experimental approaches to                      observing excited states in chemical reactions.",
