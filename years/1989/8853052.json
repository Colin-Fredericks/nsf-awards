 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests two Hewlett Packard 4145B semiconductor                  parameter analyzers and two plotters provide the base for                       laboratory improvement in the area of integrated circuit design.  The           purposes of the laboratory improvement are to introduce modern                  measurement approaches to integrated device and circuit                         characterization and to improve the laboratory offerings                        associated with two recently introduced courses in the integrated               circuit design area.  One course emphasizes analog integrated                   circuit design, and the other emphasizes VLSI subsystems design                 and includes their fabrication.  These courses were placed                      together to provide cross-fertilization between digital and analog              design as well as between MOS and bipolar technologies.  The                    equipment will be used to measure and plot semiconductor device                 parameters and the characteristics of basic circuits such as                    integrated resistors, amplifiers, sources, level shifters, logic                gates, and nonlinear analog functional circuits.  Input/output and              transfer characteristics will be measured for devices and                       circuits.",
