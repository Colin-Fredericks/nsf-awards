 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is interdisciplinary research in which applied mathematics                 and parallel numerical simulations will be used to investigate                  pattern formation, transition to turbulence, and transport for                  Rayleigh-Bernard convection.  The limit of small reduced Raleigh                numbers and large aspect ratio will be emphasized since this                    regime is amenable to analysis by singular perturbation methods                 and has been extensively studied with high-precision laboratory                 experiments.  Model equations as well as the Boussinesq equations               in two- and three-dimensional domains will be studied for normal                and binary fluids.                                                                                                                                              A novel and central part of the work will be the development of                 the convection codes on a 64-node shared-memory MIMD Butterfly-                 Plus parallel computer (which is to be upgraded in a year to 128-               nodes of more powerful processors).  Issues of parallel large-                  scale scientific computing in a shared-memory context-especially                algorithmic efficiency, memory contention, and load balancing-                  will be examined for spectral-element multigrid methods, which                  solve nonlinear partial differential equations with high                        efficiency and accuracy on general domains using locally                        refinable meshes.  Advances in numerical analysis, parallel                     computations, model building, and the physics of driven                         dissipative systems are expected.",
