 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beginning-level students find science textbook difficult to use and             understand.  One cause is a mismatch between the organization of                information in textbooks, and students knowledge structures and                 learning goals.  This project investigates the use of interactive               computerized texts as an alternative to printed textbooks for teaching          secondary-level science.  Interactive text (or \"flexible texts\")                present the learning material from a computer database, which is                organized by students based on their learning goals and prior                   knowledge.  These texts (1) allow students to organize the information          according to  their learning needs; (2) make text learning a more               active process, thus promoting a deeper understanding; and (3) give             learners more control over their learning material, which can increase          motivation.  The research will first investigate secondary-school               learners' knowledge representations and the capabilities they achieve.          Second, it will test the utility of various learning aids for                   supporting effective flexible text strategies.  Third, it will use the          knowledge gained from this research to demonstrate in a prototype               system how to design flexible texts that produce better learning than           printed texts for scientific content (ie., topics in electricity and            related topics on magnetism.)",
