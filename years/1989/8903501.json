 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three principal investigators will apply various                       geometric, symbolic dynamic, and ergodic methods to solve                       problems concerning finite-dimensional flows and mappings.  One                 investigator will concentrate on fixed-point theorems for surface               homeomorphisms, the conjugacy problem for subshifts of finite                   type, and knots in three-dimensional flows.  A second                           investigator will study the creation of strange attractors                      through bifurcation at the onset of chaos.  The third                           investigator will use ergodic theory to study the geodesic flow                 for manifolds with nonpositive curvature.                                            \"Dynamical systems\" is the mathematics of movement.  Two                   problems of intense interest in this field are the topological                  nature of closed orbits and bifurcations at the onset of chaos.                 One investigator will continue his analysis of the knot types of                closed orbits in three dimensions.  He seeks to use the Jones                   polynomial which catergorizes knot types to better understand                   orbits of such systems as the Lorenz and Henon attractors.  A                   second investigator will improve upon our understanding of Smale                \"horseshoes\" created at the onset of chaos.  For a system of                    differential equations describing for example water flow, the                   existence of these bent topological objects would indicate                      turbulent behavior.",
