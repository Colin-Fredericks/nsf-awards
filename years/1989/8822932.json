 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the 1980s, interest groups have expanded their lobbying                  efforts on behalf of or in opposition to federal judicial                       nominations.  As the federal judiciary has become more evenly                   divided along ideological lines, organized interests have clashed               in the Senate Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate.               The extraordinary degree of mobilization and the intensity and                  numbers of interest groups involved in the debate over the                      nomination of Judge Bork as an Associate Justice of the Supreme                 Court and of other less visible appointments suggest a new style                of judicial nominating politics:  Organized interest groups are                 activated to influence judicial nominations, and they demonstrate               a commitment to continue to do so.  It is difficult, however, to                isolate and trace the influence that interest groups might have                 on such battles.  Little is known about why, whether, how, and                  under what circumstances interest groups affect the judicial                    nomination process.                                                                                                                                             This project will be the first in-depth quantitative analysis of                interest group lobbying of the U.S. Senate on federal judicial                  nominations.  Individuals from hundreds of groups and coalitions                at the national, state, and local levels that participated in                   these contests will be identified and interviewed.  Questions                   will focus on such issues as the relative lobbying efforts                      devoted to different senators, the use of different tactics                     (e.g., direct mail, media advertising), the size of active                      membership in each state, the decision within an organization to                take part in a particular nomination or join a coalition, and                   patterns of communication among organized interests.  The                       objectives of the study are to (1) assess the impact of                         organized lobbying efforts on the decisions of senators to                      support or oppose controversial nominations to the federal                      judiciary, (2) determine how organized groups allocate their                    lobbying resources across states and senators, and (3) develop                  and test a model of organizational decisions to participate in                  judicial nomination battles.                                                                                                                                    This research will provide new insights into the mobilization,                  collective action strategies, and impact of organized interests                 in a specific and well-defined legislative process.  The study                  should aid in the development of a unified theory of how interest               groups maneuver into and out of the various political and legal                 arenas.  Because judicial confirmation is at the intersection of                legislative and judicial policymaking, the research should also                 add to our understanding of the ability of organized interests to               shape the personnel of the Court and thus future interpretations                of the Constitution, statutes, and administrative regulations.",
