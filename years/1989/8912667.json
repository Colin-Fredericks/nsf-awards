 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) project will          establish a differential equations and applied mathematics group to             develop multidimensional approximations and attractor dimension                 calculations including the study off low stability and equations of             water waves.  The project will emphasize studies on nonlinear                   differential equations and applications and fluid dynamics and water            waves.  Some effort will focus on improving and expanding computer              facilities to strengthen graphics capabilities.  This powerful tool will        allow detailed examination of the behavior of a solution near a critical        point.  Graphical solutions of problems would permit investigators to           formulate appropriate conjectures that can be proven by employing other         methods.                                                                                                                                                        This comprehensive approach to merge numerical computations and                 graphics display will significantly increase the research capability of         a predominantly minority institution.  The principal investigator and           senior staff are well-trained and have published widely in refereed             journals.  Faculty and students involved with this project will have            their knowledge of numerical calculations increased significantly.",
