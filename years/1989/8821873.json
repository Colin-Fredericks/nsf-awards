 "awd_abstract_narration": "The timely production of quality braille greatly enhances                       blind people's access to educational, work place, and other                     activities.  The current level of production of braille does                    not meet the need, particularly in the areas of mathematics and                 science at all levels, beginning with early elementary grades.                  The increasing existence of written material in machine                         readable form and the availability of braille printers provide                  an opportunity to greatly automate and increase the production                  of braille.                                                                                                                                                     The research will develop prototype software which                              simplifies the production of both mathematical and non-                         mathematical braille.  It will require creating and integrating                 software tools for translating print to its braille equivalent;                 properly showing format information in braille; and making use                  of text files which were prepared for other purposes.  Results                  of this research and prototype development will lead to                         implementation and distribution of flexible, easy-to-use                        braille translation implementation software working on several                  microcomputers.  Without any knowledge of the braille rules,                    the software user will be able to produce quality braille,                      either by typing in text for that purpose or by using existing                  computer files from other software.  Availability of braille                    translation software will provide blind persons with more                       comprehensive access to the flood of readily available                          information accessible to the sighted community and do so in a                  more useful time frame.",
