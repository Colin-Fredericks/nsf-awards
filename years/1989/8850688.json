 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost all introductory physics courses concentrate on concepts that            were developed more than a hundred years ago.  Scant attention is paid          to ideas that involve complex behaviors.  This emphasis on domains that         are easily demonstrated in the laboratory has led to the use of physical        models that may actual cripple students' ability to conceptualize non-          Newtonian system.  While we cannot simplify complicated ideas, we can           make them understandable.  The aim is to make quantum mechanics                 accessible to the intelligent, educated person.  Interactive and                graphically oriented sets of simulations related to quantum mechanics           will be constructed exploiting the resources of the center for                  Astrophysics' scientific staff and its computer center.                                                                                                         High school students of physics will be given powerful computer-tools to        supplement real laboratory exercises.  These simulations will permit            students to carry out and analyze simulated laboratory experiments on           topics that would be otherwise inaccessible to them.  With the guidance         of their teachers, students will be able to act as scientists and gain          insight into science and its methods.  Student misconceptions will be           explored, and new ways to present modern material to high school                students will be opened.  Studies of student misconceptions will guide          the development of further uses of advanced technology.",
