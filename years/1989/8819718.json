 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nutrient limitations appear to be widespread in the                        oligotrophic rainforest ecosystems of the Rio Negro portion of                  the Amazon basin.  This research will test several hypotheses                   regarding carbon-nutrient relations and nutrient-use efficiency                 for these forests.  Four discrete primary forest communities                    (each on different soil type) will be studied, along with a                     successional community.  Species overlap between these                          communities is minimal, even though all five communities are                    located within 1 km from each other at San Carlos de Rio Negro,                 Venezuela.  Individuals from 5 species in each community (25                    species total) have been monitored for six years, providing                     baseline data on leaf production and leaf duration.  Now nutrient               and carbon relations will be studied with respect to leaf                       longevity and leaf aging and soil nutrient availability.  The                   main hypotheses are that distinct differences will emerge among                 communities (and species):  1) in leaf morphology and nutrient                  content, as a result of variation in habitat resource                           availability and species successional niche, 2) in CO2                          assimilation capacity, as function of leaf nutrient content and                 photosynthetic nitrogen- and phosphorus-use efficiency, 3) in                   long-term carbon gain and nutrient-use efficiency, as a result of               variation in photosynthetic nutrient-use efficiency, leaf                       longevity, and leaf nutrient retention and retranslocation over                 time.",
