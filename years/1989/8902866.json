 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one year, full-time award enables a cultural anthropologist                to develop his capabilities and new career interests in the                     social and historical study of technology.  His research concerns               the role of late 1960s and early 1970s San Francisco Bay Area                   culture in shaping the social construction of personal computer                 technology.  The host institution is Stanford University.  To                   gain formal training in techniques of historical investigation,                 this investigator will work with an historian and a computer                    scientist there.  Professor Joseph J. Corn, whose research                      interests in the history of technology emphasize the role of                    culture in shaping technological innovation, will guide and                     advise Prof. Pfaffenberger's study of historical sources and                    administer a reading program, which will focus on issues in the                 interpretation of technology-related historical sources.                        Professor Terry Winograd will examine and critique                              Pfaffenberger's account of the impact of culture on the technical               content of personal computer technology and, in addition, will                  guide his study of the latitude for social choice in the design                 of microprocessor chips.  The project will result in a book.                                                                                                    This project addresses a central issue in science, technology and               society studies:  the impact of context on development and use of               technology.  The investigator and his host specialists and host                 institution are uniquely well-qualified to undertake and support                this project; collaborative efforts are likely to continue after                the period of the award.  Results are likely to be appropriately                disseminated and useful.  An award in the amount of $43,000 is                  therefore recommended.",
