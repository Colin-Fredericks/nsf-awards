 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator award will provide support                 for theoretical and experimental analyses of feeding behavior,                  which Dr. Stephens views as a useful model for many behavioral                  systems.  The research will focus on the economics of the feeding               behavior of vertebrate animals in randomly varying environments.                                                                                                Most theoretical models in behavioral ecology estimate the                      fitness value of behavioral tactics in terms of some immediate                  gain (e.g., of food, mates, or offspring).  The models ignore the               gains of information that an option might provide; for example, a               given food patch may provide both calories and information about                the patch's relative quality.  Dr. Stephens has devised a new way               to estimate the value of information, and he will attempt to                    answer several new experimental and theoretical quesions                        suggested by this technique.                                                                                                                                    Evidence from experiments on risk-sensitivity and on preferences                for immediacy suggest that the temporal pattern of food                         acquisition is an important (but usually neglected) aspect of                   foraging.  Dr. Stephens will attempt to show the theoretical                    relationships between risk-sensitivity and preferences for                      immediacy, and will attempt to distinguish experimentally among                 the many theoretical models that have been proposed to explain                  these two phenomena.                                                                                                                                            Learning is usually viewed as an adaptation to an unpredictable                 environment.  Dr. Stephens' theoretical work, in its earliest                   stages, suggests that learning is as much an adaptation to                      predictability as it is an adaptation to unpredictability.                      Further development of these theoretical models has a tremendous                potential to change conventional views about animal learning and                comparative learning abilities.                                                                                                                                 Dr. Stephens' research might be applied in two practical                        contexts.  An understanding of feeding behavior is fundamental to               well-informed management of animal populations and ecosystems,                  and understanding how natural selection has solved behavioral                   decision-making problems may help students of human decision-                   making.",
