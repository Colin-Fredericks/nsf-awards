 "awd_abstract_narration": "A REU program is to involve at least eight undergraduate engineering            students in current aerospace and engineering mechanics.  These                 students will be recruited primarily from other universities in the             region and selected for the program on basis of their academic                  achievements.  Specific research projects are chosen from the areas of          computational fluid mechanics, biomechanics, experimental fluids and            propulsion, large space structures, material mechanics, rocket engine           diagnostics, and guidance and control.  In the proposed program,                student participants in the program spend one summer usually between            their junior and senior year.  Student activities during the summer             will include:  (1) Participation in research with defined periods of            topic familiarization, intense research and project reporting.  This            activity provides the primary opportunity for interaction between the           students, the faculty, and current graduate student.  (2) Attendance            at weekly REU meetings.  These meetings will guarantee contact among            the REU students and will also provide contact with faculty from                other areas.  They also provide a natural forum for the presentation            of project results and summaries of research.  (3) Attendance at local          professional meetings.  (4) Visits to private and government research           facilities.  The REU program will be administered by a faculty                  coordinator.  The coordinator will organize the student recruiting              efforts, manage the process of student selection and assignment,                coordinate weekly meetings of participants, and arrange visits to               research facilities.",
