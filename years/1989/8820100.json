 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"A Study of Atmospheric Fronts Over                            Mountainous Terrain\" between Dr. William Blumen of the                          University of Colorado and Professors ZHAO Ming and WU                          Rongsheng of Nanjing University is jointly sponsored by NSF                     and the Chinese State Educational Commission (SEDC).                                                                                                            The investigators propose to study physical processes that                      affect atmospheric frontal motions over the earth's orography,                  specifically the mountainous regions of China.  They will                       emphasize the role of the planetary boundary layer in this                      process.  The investigations will consist of 1) observational                   and analysis study to document and examine various cases of                     frontal distortion by orography;  2) a numerical modelling                      effort to simulate frontal motion over terrain features such                    as the Tien Shan complex in western China;  and 3) a                            theoretical study to examine the relation between frontal                       motion and planetary boundary processes.  The investigators                     will carry out the first two phases at Nanjing University,                      where the data, analysis procedures and numerical model                         resources are.  The Chinese investigators will plan and                         execute these aspects of the research in consultation with                      the American investigator.  The theoretical phases, including                   analysis of the numerical experiments, will be carried out                      jointly through visits.                                                                                                                                         Scientists do not completely understand the physical                            processes that affect frontal passage over mountainous                          terrain, complicating numerical weather prediction.  The                        grid resolution and model physics may be insufficient to                        depict fronts adequately and, therefore, meteorological                         predictions in the vicinity of large mountain complexes are                     generally less reliable than elsewhere.  The proposed                           research is of mutual interest to both the Chinese and                          American investigators.  The particular emphasis placed on                      orographic effects in China will expose Western scientists                      to meteorological observations that have not been readily                       accessible, and the sharing of resources contributes to the                     research program.",
