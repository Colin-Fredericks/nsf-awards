 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of the rate of production and dissolution               of biogenic silica in the uppermost 150 meters of the Ross Sea,                 and is part of a coordinated study of the biogenic silica and                   organic carbon cycling in the water column and the sediments of                 the Ross Sea.  The antarctic deep sea and continental shelf                     environment is the major repository for silica accumulation in the              global ocean, and dominates the global silica budget,  The Ross                 Sea is a particularly anomalous area in which large amounts of                  biogenic silica are accumulating in modern sediments, while the                 surface production rates are generally below the global average.                Moreover the usual similarity between the oceanic silicon and                   carbon cycle does not appear to hold around Antarctica, and the                 two cycles are decoupled in that the rate of particulate carbon                 deposition in the modern sediment is very low.  The project is an               integrated study of the production, vertical transport,                         dissolution, and deposition processes, using moored                             instrumentation and direct observations in a series of transects                in the Ross Sea by R/V POLAR DUKE.                                                                                                                              The objectives of the project are to measure the seasonal                       variability of silica production and dissolution rates in areas of              silica-rich and silica-poor surface sediments, and to produce the               surface silica budget that will be combined with vertical flux and              sediment accumulation data to be obtained by the cooperating                    investigators.//",
