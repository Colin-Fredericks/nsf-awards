 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program used both an experimental and analytical                   approach to investigate the effectiveness of grouting in                        modifying the behavior of sand under static and dynamic loading                 conditions.  It is anticipated that this research will lead to a                better understanding of the interactive role of grout in grouted                sand, and a representation of grouted sand behavior in terms of                 its constituent properties and the interaction between those                    properties.  A wide spectrum of grouts from strong and brittle to               weak and ductile will be investigated.  A grout quality rating                  system will be developed based on the working properties and                    mechanical properties of grouts.  This will help in systemati-                  cally evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of old and new                grouting materials.  Bonding between the grout and the sand will                be studies under tension, shear and mixed-mode loading using                    various test configurations.  A biaxial model test will be                      utilized to study the composite behavior of grouted sand in terms               of the behavior of grouts in soil pores, particle rolling and                   sliding, and initial and progressive failure with different                     particle size and cluster arrangements.  Chemical and long term                 properties (time dependant) of grouts and grouted sand will be                  investigated.  Modeling of stress-strain-time relationships and                 failure criteria for grouted sand will be done using the                        continuum approach, the composite approach, and the probabilistic               approach.  Factors such as irrecoverable strain, hysteresis and                 volume changes will be incorporated.  Fracture mechanics concepts               will be introduced to explain some of the observed brittle                      behavior of grouted sand including modes of failure.",
