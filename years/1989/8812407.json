 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a renewal of the 2 year award made to Rice                     University to implement a regional network in the state of Texas.               This second phase is a three year award that would add 7 new                    universities:  Baylor University, Lamar University, Prarie View                 A&M University, Southwest Research Institute, Texas Tech                        University, The University of Texas at Arlington, and The                       University of Texas at Dallas to the network.  Also, this phase                 would augment the current Sesquinet Network Operation Center with               a Network Information Center which would provide all campuses in                the Sesquinet region with documentation, training and other                     much-needed user services.                                                                                                                                      The network backbone would connect the major areas in the state                 with high speed (224 thousand bits per second - 1.5 million bits                per second) lines via., Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, and               the Johnson Space Center.  Each campus would be connected to                    these major \"nodes\" with medium speed communication lines (56                   thousand bits per second).                                                                                                                                      Cost sharing is offered by each campus participating in the                     network.   Each campus pays for half the purchase price of the                  routing equipment, half the price of software maintenance, and                  the complete cost of maintaining equipment.***",
