 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taylor will do practical and theoretical calculations for                  group rings of finite groups.  He intends to study classification               of manifolds and their neighborhoods via approximate fibration                  theory.  He intends to study Pin structures on manifolds with                   special attention to the low-dimensional cases.  Finally, he                    intends to calculate invariants for function spaces and related                 objects.                                                                             Dwyer will study the uniqueness of classifying spaces and,                 indeed, any space whose loop space is a finite complex.  He                     intends to develop the theory of pi-algebras as a tool in                       homotopy theory.  He intends to study various realization                       problems via a lifting of diagrams approach.  He intends to study               Andre-Quillen cohomology and apply the results to the Lie ring                  analyzer of M. Barratt.                                                              Williams hopes to prove an equivariant A-theory Novikov                    conjecture, as this would give a proof of the L-theory Novikov                  conjecture.  He will study the forget-control map in approximate                fibration theory and intends to use such results to study various               geometric questions.  He intends to use approximate fibrations to               study manifolds and their neighborhoods, in particular, the                     equivariant and codimension-2 case.  He intends to modify surgery               theory to give calculations of the group of automorphisms of a                  manifold rather than the group of blocked automorphisms.                             The totality of investigations, by the three faculty members               involved cut a wide swath through topology.  Some topics attempt                to enhance the algebraic machinery for classifying manifolds.                   Others are more directly geometric.  Problems range from targets                of opportunity, which arose in the course of the investigators'                 recent work, to a famous conjecture by the Russian topologist S.                P. Novikov, which has resisted many attacks for years but has                   recently shown some chinks in its armor.",
