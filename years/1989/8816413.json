 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have developed equations for the kinetics of 18O/16O                    exchange between minerals and hydrothermal fluids that can be                   used as an \"oxygen isotope clock\".  The  18 values of coexisting                minerals represent isochrons that can measure the \"life-times\"                  and water/rock ratios of fossil hydrothermal systems without                    doing lengthy computer simulations.  We wish to apply these                     concepts to various rift-zone environments, where enhanced                      fracture permeability allows deep circulation of surface waters.                Shallow, short-lived systems have been well studied, but deeper,                longer-lived, and hotter systems transitional to crustal melting                are poorly understood.  We intend to study such \"hydrothermal-                  anatetic\" magmas in:  (1) Hercynian-age Metamorphic Systems in                  Europe, including the classic area of migmatites in the Black                   Forest, West Germany.  (2) Volcanism in Rift-Zone Environments,                 notably in Iceland, the Great Basin in Nevada, and the Snake                    River Plain, Idaho.  (3) Spreading Centers in Arabia, including a               22 Ma subaerial hydrothermal system (opening of the Red Sea), and               a 95 Ma submarine system (Oman ophiolite complex).                                   Also, we need to improve our understanding of the 18O/16O                  geochemistry of the continental crust and upper mantle, notably                 in:  (4) Detrital Sedimentary Rocks of different types and                      metamorphic grades to better define the geochemical cycles of                   18O/16O and D/H during digeneses, metamorphism and melting.  (5)                The Ivrea Zone, Northern Italy, perhaps the best available                      section through the lowermost continental crust.  (6) Quaternary-               Age Igneous Rocks of Italy.  (7) Eclogite and Periodotite                       Xenoliths to better define fluid-rock interactions in the upper                 mantle, and to try to identify ancient subducted oceanic crust in               these sub-continental lithosphere.",
