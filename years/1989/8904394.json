 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this proposal follow two parallel developments in                  the application of thermodynamics to problems of protein                        unfolding.  One addresses fundamental issues associated with                    thermodynamics of solvent-induced and thermal unfolding of                      proteins and the other involves the use of thermodynamic                        techniques in studies of the unfolding of oxidized and reduced                  thioredoxin and mutant thioredoxin species.  Thioredoxin is a                   protein in which a change in protein stability is an integral                   aspect of it function.  Thermodynamic studies of the unfolding of               thioredoxin and site-specific mutant forms of this protein can be               used to establish the ground rules and constraints to which                     mechanistic studies of thioredoxin folding must conform.                                                                                                        Historically, there have been two major approaches to the problem               of protein folding.  One, largely thermodynamic in emphasis, is                 concerned with the stability of protein species and attempts to                 understand the forces which lead to stabilization of the native                 (folded) state.  The other approach, which uses kinetic studies                 to a large extent, focuses on mechanisms of folding with the goal               of understanding the molecular events which ultimately lead to                  the folding native protein.  Both of these approaches have                      contributed to the present day understanding of protein folding.",
