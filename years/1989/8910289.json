 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the application of the formal theory of knowledge          to the theory of distributed systems.  The emphasis is on the                   application of theoretic techniques to gain lower bounds on classical           problems in distributed computing, to design knowledge-based protocols          that solve other problems, to study further the concept of knowledge            based-protocols and to automate stages in deriving implementations of           knowledge-based protocols.  The project also studies the role of                knowledge in probabilistic systems where one has to cope with both              random coin flips and nondeterministic adversary behavior of some               elements in the system.  Another closely related issue is that of               capturing the knowledge of agents who do not have perfect reasoning             abilities.  One of the goals in investigating knowledge in                      probabilistic systems and knowledge of non-perfect reasoners is us to           determine the type of knowledge that arises in zero knowledge                   interactive proofs.  The PI is investigating the concepts of knowledge          used by game-theoreticians and trying to apply their methods and                results to problems in distributed systems.",
