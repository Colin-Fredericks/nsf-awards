 "awd_abstract_narration": "R. Connelly intends to study some fundamental problems in                  the theory of rigid structures.  Typical subjects include                       minimal cabling, self-stresses and Gale diagrams, generic                       global rigidity, and the pre-stress stability of certain                        symmetric \"tensegrids\".  A basic concept that has proved                        surprisingly useful is the energy form associated to a                          self-stress for a tensegrity framework.  Its rank, index, and                   positive definiteness are all related to important rigidity                     properties and should prove useful in the future.  Connelly                     also plans to study certain packing and covering problems,                      particularly those related to rigidity.                                              The mathematical theory underlying the rigidity of                         frameworks composed of rigid rods or of such frameworks                         reinforced by bracing cables is surprisingly amenable to                        analysis by general principles as well as of obvious practical                  relevance.  Packing and covering problems also support a rich                   theory and have been found relevant to the design of                            error-correcting codes among other things.",
