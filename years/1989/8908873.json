During the twelve month period beginning 15               August 1989, Professor Bailey will work with Professor John P.                  Oliver of Wayne State University to determine, by X-ray                         diffraction, the structures of several sterically hindered and                  optically active organoaluminum compounds.  These pursuits will                 enable Professor Bailey to develop her background in main group                 organometallic chemistry and to refresh her skills in modern X-                 ray diffraction and related computer methods for molecular                      structure determination by single-crystal X-ray analysis.  These                activities should contribute strongly to her establishing an                    independent research program in her own laboratory at Central                   Michigan University upon her return there in August, 1990.                                                                                                      The research area that is to be explored in this project is an                  important one and the results of the work could contribute                      significantly to basic knowledge in this area.",
