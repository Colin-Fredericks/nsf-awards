This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and                Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The program             is designed to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to                    conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the conduct of             joint research and the use of unique or complementary facilities,               expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                     The award will support a 15 month research visit by Dr. Kathleen L.             Kelly, Boston University School of Medicine, with Dr. Faustino                  Mollinedo, Ph.D, of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones                     Cientificas, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Madrid, Spain.               The researchers will seek (1) to characterize the acute effects of              tumor necrosis factor on phospholipases A2 C and D activities in                adipocytes, and (2) to determine if this effect correlates with                 inhibition of lipoprotein lipase activity and synthesis.                                                                                                        Tumor necrosis factor, produced by macrophages in response to                   invasive stimuli, is a primary mediator of immunity and inflammation.           In addition to its mediator of immunity and inflammation.  In                   addition to its anti-tumor effects, tumor necrosis factor inhibits              anabolic processes in adipose tissue.  It has been postulated that              in the acute phase of infectious challenge, tumor necrosis factor               would induce a net flux of lipid into the circulation, where the                host defense system could use it as an energy source.  However, an              adverse effect of tumor necrosis factor is a loss in the anabolic               regulation of adipocytes by insulin.  The molecular events and                  signalling mechanisms which underlie the effects of tumor necrosis              factor remain to be delineated.  Preliminary data from other                    laboratories suggest that phospholipid hydrolysis may be an                     obligatory event in mediating the cytolytic effects of tumor                    necrosis factor stimulates phospholipase activity in adipocytes,                and that this effect is correlated to its catabolic actions.  The               results of this study could have implications in developing                     therapies for the treatment of diseases such as type II diabetes                and AIDS, which are characterized by insulin resistance, hypertrigly-           ceridemia and tissue wasting.                                                                                                                                   The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,               international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents'                 allowance, if applicable, and a flat administrative allowance of                $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.  //",
