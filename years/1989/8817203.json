 "awd_abstract_narration": "Epithermal gold, silver and copper deposits in volcanic                    environments have been divided into \"adularia-sericite\" and                     \"acid-sulfate\" types.  The adularia-sericite gold deposits are                  more numerous and have been well studied, their environment of                  formation being further clarified by studies of active geothermal               systems.  These deposits formed from heat near-neutral and low                  salinity alkali chloride waters under reducing conditions.  In                  contrast, the acid-sulfate type gold, silver and copper deposits                are relatively scarce and few have been studied in detail using                 modern techniques.  In these deposits the enargite and the                      alunite appear to have formed from acid waters with relatively                  high sulfur and oxygen fugacities, but it is not certain if the                 gold was also transported and deposited under these conditions.                 It is possible that the gold ores formed as a result of a                       separate, generally later but spatially superimposed process.  We               intend to resolve this uncertainty by making an integrated                      geochemical and isotopic investigation of the El Indio (Chile)                  deposit, where very high grade gold ore formed after the enargite               mineralization, sometimes in different structures.  This will                   allow us to study separately the conditions of formation of the                 gold and the copper ores, and thus clarify if both belong to a                  single evolutionary process or if they result from quite                        different processes that coincide geographically, perhaps because               both are linked to the same intrusive and volcanic locus.",
