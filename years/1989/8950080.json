 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is an introductory two week workshop on various aspects of          Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy for science faculty in            the Southwest.  The faculty are being given the opportunity to enhance          their understanding of modern spectroscopy, so that they cans bring             this augmented knowledge to bear on their own teaching.  The learning           environment is an interactive workshop which includes a hands-on                component for a series of modern NMR spectrometers as well as an                exposure to a variety of other state-of-the-art spectroscopic metnods.          The main thrust of this workshop is Fourier Transform NMR Spectroscopy,         both ID and 2D.  The course includes lectures, hands on laboratory              experiences, problem solving sessions, and detailed instructions for            setting up an inexpensive data station for teaching FT-NMR, without             requiring access to a sp0ectrometer.  This will enable FT-NMR to be             incorporated into the curriculum.  In addition to the workshops,                experience in four other spectroscopic techniques is also being                 provided; including Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy, X-ray                 crystallography, ESCA and Fast Kenetics using Lasers.                                                                                                           The University is also contributing funds in support of this program.",
