 "awd_abstract_narration": "The homing of salmon to the rivers where they originated is one                 of the great mysteries of animal behavior.  It is known that                    young salmon learn the odors of their home river and seek these                 odors when they return as adults.  However, it is not known                     whether they retrace a sequence of odors or merely seek the odor                that they experienced prior to seaward migration.  It is also not               known whether they can learn odors only at specific developmental               stages or at any time during their period of freshwaterresidence.                                                                                               To help resolve these questions, Dr. Quinn and his colleagues                   reared juvenile coho salmon and exposed them to the odors of the                University of Washington's hatchery at specific times and                       developmental stages in 1988.  They were released from another                  hatchery and are expected to return as adults in fall 1989 and                  1990.  Depending on where the salmon from the different                         experimental groups return, Dr. Quinn hopes to determine the ways               in which they learned the odors of their environment as young                   fish and how they use these odors to return years later.                                                                                                        Homing is an essential feature of the life history of salmon.                   Knowledge of the patterns of behavior underlying homing will                    enhance the ability to protect and rehabilitate populations of                  these extremely valuable fishes.",
