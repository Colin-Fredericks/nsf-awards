This conference is the continuation of the                        series of Gordon Research Conferences on Nuclear Physics.  The                  unique character of this conference is widely recognized both                   in the United States and abroad.  It has been organized to                      cover a number of the important subfields in nuclear physics                    and makes possible for spirited discussion and communications                   among scientists in these areas.  The program this year                         selected some of the most interesting developments, both                        theoretical and experimental, in nuclear structure,                             electromagnetic interactions, heavy-ion collisions, subnuclear                  effects and hadron structure and symmetries in nuclei.  There                   were also talks on new detector initiatives for nuclear                         physics and the NSAC Long Range Plan for Nuclear Physics.                       Invited speakers, session chairmen and attendees have been                      selected to ensure a mix of senior researchers, post-docs and                   advanced graduate students among the participants.  A major                     part of the funds will be used to provide support for young                     scientists attending the conference.",
