 "awd_abstract_narration": "An innovative short course on Fourier analysis is being given to groups         of 18 college faculty at SIU's Touch of Nature Conference Center during         the summers of 1989 and 1990.  Lectures are discussing Fourier's                representation of discrete and continuous functions; the operator               identities that facilitate a deep understanding of the rules and                symmetries of this discipline; the fast Fourier transform from Gauss`           interpolation bases on derivation to modern variants such as                    Bracewell's recently patented fast Hartley transform; an elementary new         theory of generalized functions, i.e., distributions, that are widely           used in mathematics and its applications; and selected applications of          these ideas from the mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences.          Participants are using personal computers (with especially designed             user friendly software) to deepen their understanding of the rules and          operator identities developed in the lectures, to experience fast,              i.e., 0(N log N),  as opposed to slow, i.e., O(N2), N-digit arithmetic,         and to solve practical problems using fast transform methods.  The              lecture notes, exercise sets, and computer discs from the short courses         are preparing the participants to introduce corresponding                       interdisciplinary undergraduate Fourier analysis courses in their home          institutions or to enrich and modernize existing courses in numerical           analysis, Fourier series, ordinary and partial differentials equations,         etc., already in place in the curriculum.                                                                                                                          The Division of Mathematical Sciences is also providing support for          this project.  The University is contributing to the cost of the                program, with the individual participant's home institutions also               bearing a cost of the participation.",
