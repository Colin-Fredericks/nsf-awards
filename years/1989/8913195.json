 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of earthquake engineering and                                   seismic safety policy is a long-term,                                           continuing process by which California has                                      made substantial progress in responding to the                                  state's seismic hazard.  While some of the                                      main trends are generally known, no concerted                                   effort has been made to capture and record                                      information on the way the process has worked,                                  and especially on the careers and activities                                    of key individuals who have played leadership                                   roles.  Accordingly this project attempts to                                    acquire and organize such information, using                                    the established methodology of oral history                                     interviewing, recording  and indexing.  The                                     interviews focus on (1) the development and                                     application of earthquake engineering in                                        California, and (2) the formulation and                                         implementation of seismic safety policy, with                                   particular attention to California's Seismic                                    Safety Commission.  The principal objectives                                    are collecting information on leadership                                        development and effective problem-solving in                                    earthquake engineering and seismic safety                                       policy.  California's experience has a                                          potential for wider utility and application                                     elsewhere, especially in other states that are                                  sure to be developing future programs of                                        earthquake engineering and seismic safety                                       policy.  This can be facilitated by a better                                    understanding of how these processes have                                       worked in California, and of what can be                                        adapted from California's experience.",
