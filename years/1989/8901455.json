 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research into basic                    problems at the interface of the theories of several complex                    variables and partial differential equations.  The analytic                     object of concern is the tangential Cauchy-Riemann operator, a                  differential operator acting on functions defined on the boundary               of a domain in the space of several complex variables (or on more               general complex manifolds).  These operators agree with CR-                     operators defined on neighborhoods of boundary points.  The                     object of much current activity in this area today addresses the                issue of when can a function satisfying the homogeneous CR-                     equations on the boundary be the restriction of a holomorphic                   function defined on some surrounding open set?  This is the                     extension problem and it involves solving systems of complex                    partial differential equations.  The equations themselves are                   interesting because they serve as prototypes of overdetermined                  systems of differential equations which are not elliptic                        complexes.                                                                           Work will be done investigating the regularity properties of               the tangential operators on weakly pseudo-convex boundaries.                    Specifically, one would like to make estimates of how the                       functions in certain classes are (or are not) preserved under the               action of these operators.  The case where the functions are                    square-integrable has been worked out in detail.  For the other                 Lebesgue spaces and for functions which are Holder continuous,                  good progress has recently been made in two dimensions.  Efforts                will be made to extend these results to higher dimension.                            Additional work will be done in seeking a resolution of the                problem of embedding abstract strongly pseudo-convex                            CR-structures in complex space.  For all odd real dimensions this               problem has been solved by Kuranishi's embedding theorem except                 for the dimension three.  This research will seek to exploit a                  new homotopy approach to determine if the final case can be                     settled.",
