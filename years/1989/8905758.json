 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thousands of lakes on coastal lowlands of Cook Inlet,                      Alaska, contain populations of the threepine stickleback,                       Gasterosteus aculeatus.  Until recession of the last (Naptowne)                 glacial advance 13,000 years ago, Cook Inlet was filled with                    glacial ice.  As glacial ice withdrew, marine sticklebacks                      colonized newly-formed freshwater habitats.  Marine threespine                  stickebacks are structurally homogeneous and still occur along                  the Pacific Cost of North America.  Thus, all freshwater                        sticklebacks in Cook Inlet were derived recently from a known                   common ancestor.  Preliminary studies indicate that Cook Inlet                  stickleback are structurally diverse, and variable reduction and                loss of the pelvic girdle is a common recurrent phenomenon.                          Recurrent pelvic reduction permits study of interactions of                natural selection and intrinsic properties of the organism.                     Associations between pelvic reduction and environmental variables               will be studied using about 300 stickleback populations.  The                   analysis will provide hypotheses for causation of pelvic                        reduction.  Some populations may be too young for extensive                     pelvic reduction to have evolved.  This hypothesis will be tested               by analyzing the relation between the extent of pelvic reduction                and lake age.  The hypothesis that developmental processes bias                 evolution of vestigial pelvic phenotypes will be tested by                      studying development of the pelvic girdle in populations without                pelvic reduction.  Absence of predatory fishes and resultant                    increased insect predation has already been implicated in                       evolution of pelvic reduction.  Feasibility of testing this                     hypothesis by studying changes of pelvic phenotype frequencies in               lakes with and without introduced predatory fishes will be                      determined.  The proposed research will provide insights into                   evolutionary mechanisms and form the basis for further                          evolutionary investigations using pelvic reduction in threepine                 sticklebacks.",
