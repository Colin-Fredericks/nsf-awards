 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fabrication of integrated circuits involves creation of                     patterned, multilayer, thin film structures composed of                         insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.  Typically, these                   structures are constructed by using photolithographic                           techniques in conjunction with additional processing steps,                     including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), etching, doping,                     etc.  Some of steps (e.g. wet etching) lack sufficient                          resolution for high ensity devices, while others (e.g. high                     temperature CVD) subject the wafer to extreme conditions that                   may damage underlying structures.  This has resulted in                         increased interest in laser processing of microelectronic                       devices.                                                                                                                                                        The PI's research is focused on laser induced deposition.  The                  process of scanning a laser beam across a substrate, causing                    reactants in either the gas, liquid or solid phase to react                     and deposit on the substrate is referred to as laser direct-                    write Potential applications of laser processing include                        repair and modification of devices and masks, production of                     small quantities of custom devices, and construction of new                     structures that take advantage of the laser controlled                          chemistry and the optical properties of the precursor and                       substrate materials.  This equipment grant will provide funds                   for the purchase of a laser directwrite system for                              investigating fundamental mechanisms underlying nonlinear                       morphological effects in direct laser writing of metal and                      semiconductor lines from spun-on metalorganic layers as well                    as gaseous reactants.  The system  consists of a microscope                     for focusing radiation from an Ar+ laser onto a substrate.  An                  x-y translation stage moves the substrate relative to the                       laser beam so that lines may be written.  The nonlinear                         behavior that will be investigated include multiplicity                         phenomena, periodic patterns, and volcano-shape deposits.                       These effects are observed over a wide range of operating                       conditions in a large number of applications including the                      deposition of gold from organogold films, silicon from silane,                  and Y-Ba-Cu-O superconductors from spun-on metalorganic films.                  The overall goals are to understand the underlying fundamental                  processes and to develop predictive models that may be used to                  prevent or control the nonlinear behavior.",
