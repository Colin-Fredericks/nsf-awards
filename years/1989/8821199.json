 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to improve the process                         by which equipment and processes are designed for                               removing water from sludges.  This will involve the                             development of computer based simulation models of                              full-scale dewatering facilities that will enable cost-                         effective design and the ability to identify                                    operational conditions to maximize dewatering                                   efficiency.  Theoretical approaches will include                                modeling the physics of the belt filter press which                             involves gravity sedimentation, cake filtration in a                            laterally unconfined domain incorporating the effect of                         secondary consolidation or creep, cake removal                                  mechanisms, and belt washing efficiency.  The                                   integrated model of the belt filter press is expected                           to be driven by laboratory derived relationships of                             sludge porosity as functions of effective stress and                            permeability.  These relationships will be determined                           by examining specific resistance and compression-                               permeability cell data.  The model will be tested with                          data from a scale model filter press using a                                    reproducible suspension of kaolin.  Further model                               testing will be accomplished using the city of                                  Portland's full-scale belt filter presses to analyze                            the model's ability to predict dewatering                                       characteristics of an anaerobically digested sludge.                                                                                                            Results of this project are expected to be used in                              improvements of current practice in designing systems                           for dewatering sludges, processing and management of                            which are approximately half the cost of wastewater                             treatment.",
