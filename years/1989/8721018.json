 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research             project in applied laser spectroscopy between Pajo V. Cvijin of                 Belgrade's Institute of Physics and George H. Atkinson from the                 University of Arizona is to study the fundamental aspects of laser              photoaccoustic spectroscopy and its application to research in                  environmental and atmospheric sciences.  Both investigators have                devoted a significant part of their research effort to the                      development of ultrasensitive detection methods for atmospheric                 pollutants.  The proposed cooperation will broaden the research of              both groups by combining the Belgrade expertise in photoaccoustic               spectroscopy applied to the the infrared spectral region with the               Arizona group's work in the visible and ultra violet spectral                   regions.                                                                                                                                                        This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The grants are            composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to               Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
