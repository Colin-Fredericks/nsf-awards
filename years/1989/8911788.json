 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Datko will investigate the effects of                            time delays on stabilizing boundary controls of some                            infinite-dimensional systems.  Three areas will be                              considered. (i) The effects of small time delays on                             stabilizing controls for systems described by hyperbolic                        partial differential equations. (ii) The robustness of                          the stability of viscoelastic systems in the presence of                        time delays vis a vis elastic systems.  The former                              appear, in some cases, to be less sensitive than the                            latter when time delays are introduced into their                               damping.  Hence viscoelastic systems may serve as more                          suitable models for flexible structures than elastic                            systems. (iii) A reexamination of controllability and                           stabilizability for elastic systems with a view to                              considering \"approximate\" definitions of these concepts                         which are robust with respect to perturbations involving                        time delays.",
