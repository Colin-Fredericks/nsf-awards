Methods used will                 include field work with several Omaha speaking consultants and                  analysis of previously recorded texts.  The project will employ                 one research assistant who is a native speaker of the language.                                                                                                      As the initial step toward a planned study of Omaha-Ponka                  relative clauses and interrogatives within the framework of                     Government-Binding theory, the present project will survey and                  describe the major syntactic constructions of Omaha-Ponka,                      particularly including various types of nominalizations and topic               or focus constructions.                                                                                                                                              The project has value as an application of Government-                     Binding theory to a language very different from the European and               Oriental languages that have received the most attention under                  this framework.  It has practical significance as well, since the               language has not been adequately described, and only elderly                    speakers remain.  Very little scholarly work, all phonologically                or morphologically oriented, has been done on Omaha-Ponka; the                  syntax is essentially unexplored.  Indeed, little is known of the               syntax of Siouan languages in general.  The collection and                      description of syntactic data on Omaha-Ponka in itself                          constitutes a valuable contribution to linguistic knowledge.",
