 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diseases caused by soilborne plant pathogens in                            containerized growing media cause significant economic losses                   annually to greenhouse industries throughout the world.  A wide                 range of pesticides are applied in an attempt to control these                  organisms, but pathogen protection within the growth media, or                  recolonization by the pathogen, results in poor or short-lived                  control.                                                                             Species of the naturally occurring soilborne fungus,                       Trichoderma, have been shown to be effective antagonists of                     several fungal plant pathogens.  Recent efforts have been made to               incorporate biological disease control organisms into                           containerized nursery operations, however, very few attempts                    have been made to combine this with other beneficial organisms                  such as mycorrhizal fungi.  In this study, several isolates                     Trichoderma and the ectomycorrhizal fungus, Laccaria laccata will               be evaluated for their ability to co-establish and cooperate in                 the control of root pathogens in a containerized growing media                  with Douglas fir.                                                                    A series of experiments are planned to establish the                       methodologies necessary for the co-selection, inoculation and                   establishment of effective biocontrol systems for the                           containerized nursery industry.  Direct benefits include a low                  cost, long-lasting and less hazardous system for the control of                 soilborne fungal pathogens which would continue long after the                  planting stock leaves the nursery.                                                   This research would lead to development of a biocontrol                    agent which, when introduced into containerized growing media                   during its preparation, would control soilborne pathogens present               and prevent subsequent invasion of pathogens and disease                        development on seedlings growing in the media.  Its use would                   reduce the expensive pesticides harmful to humans and their                     environment.",
