 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project upgrades and improves the equipment used in the               biomedical engineering laboratory at Wright State University by                 interfacing state-of-the-art physiological signal conditioners                  into existing PC-controlled workstations.  Currently the special                transducers and matched signal conditioners are borrowed from                   another academic department.  More than ten laboratory                          experiments which are offered in conjunction with three required                senior courses, will be directly benefited with this equipment.                 These laboratory experiments involve the measurements of either                 biological signals directly from living subjects (e.g. ECG                      signal) or transduced signals from simulated biological systems                 (e.g. an artificial kidney).  The acquisition of this equipment                 greatly improves the quality of the undergraduate biomedical                    laboratory.  This award is being matched by an equal amount from                the principal investigator's institution.",
