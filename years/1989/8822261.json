 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Aldenderfer will continue his archaeological research in the                Osmore basin which is located in far southern Peru.  Three sites,               two situated in rockshelters and one in open air, will be                       excavated.  All are located well above sea level and sample                     different high altitude zones.  All date from the Middle Archaic                and Early Formative periods which extend from approximately 8,000               to 3,500 years before the present.  Dr. Aldenderfer and his                     colleagues will excavate large areas of these sites to identify                 architectural remains and to recover artifactual, faunal, and                   floral remains.  Subsequent analysis will allow him to trace                    changing settlement patterns, diet, and social organization over                time.                                                                                                                                                           During the time period under investigation, a sedentarization                   process appears to have taken place in the Osmore region.                       Coincident changes in population size and density, in subsistence               - with the emergence of domesticated plants and animals - and in                degree of social complexity also seem to have occurred.  It was                 during this period and general area that camelids and Andean                    tubers were domesticated.  Although the general outlines of the                 process are known, it is still not clear how these different                    factors interacted and which played the primary causal role.  The               goal of this research is to answer these questions.                                                                                                             The shift documented in the Osmore basin occurred at roughly the                same time in many parts of both the Old and New Worlds.  Thus,                  the Osmore basin research may provide insight into this broader                 process.  Because the region was a center for both plant and                    animal domestication and because preliminary work has shown that                faunal and floral remains are extremely well preserved at these                 sites, the region provides an excellent context to examine this                 issue.  The work will provide insight into the early stages of                  the process which led to the development of complex societies                   such as our own.",
