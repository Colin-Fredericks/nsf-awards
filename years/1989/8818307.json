 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for                   the determination of the molecular structure of compounds as                    diverse as small polypeptides and complex metal clusters.  When                 combined with the latest computer software, the technique is                    becoming remarkably easy to put into practice.  The acquisition                 of X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the                 ability of chemists to carry out frontier research.                                                                                                             The Department of Chemistry at Keene State College will use                     this RUI award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation                        Program to help acquire an X-ray diffractometer.  The                           instrument will be used to enhance research in the Department                   and in the Departments of neighboring institutions and to                       improve the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Keene State.                  Among the areas of research to be enhanced by the aquisition                    are:                                                                                                                                                            1) Structural investigations of copper (I)-laser dye clusters                   2) Structure studies and molecular modeling of retinyl Schiff                      base-urethane elastomer systems                                              3) Transition metal complexes containing perfluorinated                            organic ligands                                                              4) Cages, heterocycles and oligomers from coordinated                              phosphines                                                                   5) Chiral transition metal-olefin complexes: application to                        organic synthesis                                                            6) New molybdenum (II) allyl compounds                                          7) Model compounds of liquid crystal polymer systems                            8) Structural and conformational studies of \u0131n!(9,10) anthra-                      cenophanes                                                                   9) Transition metal complexes of tetraaza macrocyclic ligands.",
