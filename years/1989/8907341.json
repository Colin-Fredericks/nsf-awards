 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program is chemical transformations of                 organic molecules which occur while these molecules are bound                   to a metal. These reactions are intimately related to reactions                 of organic chemicals which occur on homogeneous or                              heterogeneous transition metal catalysts, and include some of                   the most important reactons in industrial chemistry.                                                                                                            Alkyne ligands and eta-2-allenyl ligands are isolobal and                       constitute a conjugate acid-base pair. The deprotonation/alkyl-                 ation reaction sequence which is central to enolate chemistry                   can be duplicated with metal bound 4-electron donor alkyne                      ligands bearing a beta-hydrogen. Deprotonation at the beta                      carbon of the alkyne forms a nucleophilic eta-2-allenyl ligand                  suitable for electrophilic addition and aldol type condensation                 reactions at the beta carbon. The use of the metal fragment to                  provide both regio and stereocontrol in such reactions will be                  explored. Also to be investigated is the possibility that the                   formation of a gamma alcohol by aldehyde addition to the                        allenyl could lead to elimination to form a conjugated enyne                    bound through the alkyne triple bond and poised for                             1,4-conjugate addition reactions. Release of the functionalized                 alkyne is expected to provide a powerful vehicle for building                   diverse organic building blocks. Since eta-2-iminoacyl and                      eta-2-vinyl ligands are expected to be acidic at the beta                       carbon position also, elaboration of these ligands via                          nucleophilic coordinated anion and eta-2-allene intermediates,                  respectively, will be pursued. Following on the successful                      stepwise reduction of metal bound nitriles by successive                        hydride addition and protonation reactions, diastereoselective                  nitrile reductions will be attempted, and the retention of                      configuration at the metal center will be probed in an effort                   to develop a catalyst for chiral amine syntheses.",
