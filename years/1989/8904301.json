Topics to be covered include:  Human Genome Initiatives-                 physical and Biological Strategies; Recombination and Resolvase;                Structure, Dynamics, Interaction and Expression of DNA, RNA, Proteins           and their complexes; and Molecular Dynamics of Biological                       Macromolecules-prospects and problems.  Participants are expected               from the U.S., Western Europe, USSR, the Middle East and India.  A              total of 500 scientists from 14 nations will be admitted.                       Significant time will be allowed for talks by graduate students,                postdoctorals and young faculty.  The Indian participants will be               from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the Indian Institute           of Science, University of Delhi, University of Delhi, University of             Madras, the Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad and            the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics.                                                                                                                          Scope:  This series of meetings started in 1979 and held every two              years is a main event to discuss developing ideas and discoveries in            the context of biological structure, dynamics, interactions and                 expressions.  Past meetings have been quite successful with                     participation from over 500 scientists from 14 countries.                       Participation of eminent Indian scientists is expected to enrich the                                                                                            debates, and to lead to future collaboration with U.S. scientists.",
