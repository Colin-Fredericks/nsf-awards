 "awd_abstract_narration": "Central to plant biology are the processes which govern                         allocation of photosynthetic products among growing tissues.                    Recent findings indicate that distribution and metabolism of                    these resources may be regulated in part by short-term                          alterations of gene expression in response to carbohydrate                      availability.  Sucrose synthase is the primary enzyme responsible               for sucrose hydrolysis in many developing plant tissues which                   depend on imported sucrose.  This laboratory has shown that                     expression of a gene encoding this enzyme in maize root tips is                 modulated by the level of sugars present.  This research goals                  are to: 1) characterize the role of carbohydrate status in                      regulation of sucrose synthase (Sh1) gene expression, 2) define                 the physiological consequences of rapid changes in Sh1                          expression, and 3) identify other carbohydrate regulated genes.                 The approach will combine metabolic studies with quantification                 of gene expression using gene specific DNA probes and antibodies.               The conditions under which this response occurs in vivo will be                 established.  In addition, maize sucrose synthase and invertase                 mutants will be used to assess the metabolic effects of short-                  term changes in sucrose synthase gene expression.  Finally, the                 possiblity that this response includes other metabolically                      important genes in addition to sucrose synthase will be                         addressed.  This research will contribute not only to the                       clarification of the interplay between gene expression and                      metabolism, but also to elucidation of mechanisms controlling                   sucrose allocation in higher plants.                                                                                                                            Perhaps the first example of sugar-modulated expression of an                   identified plant gene has been described by this laboratory.                    Specifically, the Sh1 form of sucrose synthase is rapidly and                   selectively induced in maize root tips depleted of sucrose.                     Sucrose is the predominant form in which sugars are redistributed               in most species, therefore its synthesis and breakdown are                      crucial to the plant.  Sucrose synthase catalyzes a reversible                  cleavage of sucrose, and is thus vital in tissues which import                  and metabolize sucrose.  In many instances, sucrose synthase                    activity is positively correlated with the extent of sucrose                    movement into a given tissue.  Therefore, the interaction of                    sugar levels with sucrose synthase gene expression is a potential               mechanism for regulation of sucrose import and utilization.  This               research explores sugar regulation of sucrose synthase expression               and its metabolic consequences, in detail, at the molecular,                    cellular, and whole plant levels.",
