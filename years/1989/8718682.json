 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exonuclease VII is a single stranded specific deoxynibonuclease                 which cna degrade denatured DNA, single stranded regions                        extending from from the termini of duplex DNA, or displaced                     single stranded regions. It is composed of two non-identical                    subunits, the genes being in different regions of the                           chromosome.  It is proposed here to express and purify large                    quanties of the enzyme, study the cellular regulation of its                    production, and examine the cellular effects of its deficiency.                 The availability of large quantities of the enzyme will allow                   detailed mechanistic and functional studies to begin.  Having                   the cloned genes which encode the two subunits makes possible                   studies of the transcriptional regulation of the genes.  The                    analysis of mutations may provide further insight into the                      role the enzyme plays in cellular metabolism.                                                                                                                   Nucleases are among the most abundant and diverse group of                      enzymes participating in nucleic acid metabolism.  It is                        perfectly obvious in paper models of many DNA and RNA metabolic                 processes what a variety of functions these enzymes should do.                  In actual fact, the cellular roles of only a few such enzymes                   are understood.  E. coli exonuclease VII is one that is not.                    Its enzymatic properties suggest it will be an extremely useful                 reagent for the specific removal of single-stranded termini                     from duplex DNA molecules.  Dr. Chase was the discoverer of                     Exonuclease VII and is certainly will prepared to reinitiate                    this study.",
