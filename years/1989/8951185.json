 "awd_abstract_narration": "The microcomputer laboratory is used for instrument control and                 analysis of experimental data by both scienc and non-science                    majors in physics and engineering courses.  Also, the computers                 are used for problem solving in applied mathematics and                         engineering courses and to teach Fortran and CAD to engineering                 students.  A scientific computer literacy course required of all                science and mathematics majors uses the laboratory.  Students are               able to collect, store, and analyze large quantities of data from               rapidly changing phenomena.  Through interfacing, the computers                 act as a variety of instruments and, at the same time, provide                  students with valuable experience in using computers.  The                      grantee provides funds for this project that are an equal match                 for the NSF award.",
