 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will speed the design of adsorptive protein separations,             with emphasis on efficient scale-up.  The focus is on instrumental              techniques for direct measurement of key separation parameters:                      o    Intraparticle diffusion coefficients, needed to predict                         effectiveness of any adsorptive process and especially                          important at the high loadings of commercial separators.                        Pulsed field gradient NMR techniques will be used for this                      purpose.                                                                   o    Adsorption kinetics, needed to predict resolution and yield                     losses, and again most important at high solute loading.                   o    Convective dispersion coefficients, to characterize the                         effects of system geometry and flow conditions.  Magnetic                       resonance imaging will be used.                                       Success will permit rational design based on underlying transport and           reaction principles, and thus not only to optimize process conditions           but also to consider alternate processing modes and equipment                   configurations.                                                                                                                                                 This research will enhance the development of therapeutic proteins and          other important new drugs and also reduce the cost of producing them            by providing improved procedures for downstream processing, isolation,          and purification from fermentation broths                                       or other crude sources.  Downstream processing accounts for 50 to               80 percent of total production costs but has tended to be                       neglected by engineers relative to other aspects of the                         production process.  Attention is focused here on adsorptive                    separations, such as chromatography, because these are                          particularly effective for two critically important classes of                  therapeutic agents:  proteins and synthetic organics.  Speeding                 commercial development is necessary if we are to prevent                        competitors from capitalizing on the discoveries of American                    medical and biological researchers.",
