 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines variations in human resource policies in                    work organizations in the United States, relating these                         policies to issues of productivity, technological innovation,                   and problems posed by a changing American labor force.  The                     research draws on two data sources:  a representative                           national sample of American workers and a corresponding                         sample of organizations employing them.  This will represent                    the first instance that data will have been collected on a                      nationally representative sample of work establishments, and                    the first time since the 1977 Quality of Employment Survey                      that comprehensive data will have been collected on a                           nationally representative sample of American workers.  These                    data bases are essential to test important hypotheses about                     the prevalence and variation throughout the United States of                    various management systems, recruitment and retention                           policies, training programs, and industrial relations                           practices.  Until now information in this broad human                           resource area has been available primarily from case studies                    of distinctive types of organizations in selected parts of                      the country; there has been no comprehensive description and                    assessment of human resource policies and practices in U. S.                    work organizations.  The Principal Investigators in this                        study have had extensive experience in this area of research;                   all were participants in pilot studies funded by the National                   Science Foundation, to address some of the technical problems                   involved in such a broad national survey of workers and work                    establishments.  These pilot studies carefully considered                       such basic problems as the adequacy and representativeness of                   alternative sampling designs and the  reliability of data                       collected on organizations.  The present research grows out                     of and builds upon the findings of these pilot studies.                         Issues of organizational effectiveness, competitiveness, and                    productivity are of vital concern to both scientists and                        policy makers.  This study should shed important new light on                   the links between innovative human resources policies, the                      characteristics of organizations and workers, and the                           conditions under which work is performed.",
