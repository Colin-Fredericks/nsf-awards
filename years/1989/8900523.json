This program is designed to provide students with the                    necessary intellectual and technical skills to carry out                        independent research.  Through close contact between faculty and                students this program will strive to promote student interest in                research careers.  The program will emphasize the experimental                  basis of our knowledge and will, for many students, be their                    first opportunity to experience the mastery of complex material                 and the in-depth learning of a specific topic.  In addition to                  the research experience, students will participate in a weekly                  seminar series that will introduce them to a variety to topics                  that cut across project boundaries, formally introducing students               to topics such as laboratory safety, data analysis and the                      scientific literature.",
