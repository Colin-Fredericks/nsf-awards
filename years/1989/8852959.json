 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to The Kellogg Biological Station at                  Michigan State University to purchase four items:  two basic gas                chromatographies, a scanning spectrophotometer, and a pH meter.                 Currently, The Kellogg Biological Station summer teaching program               offers a diversity of undergraduate courses in ecology which                    emphasize hands-on, field experience in a small group setting.                  Several of the courses discuss aspects both of ecosystem                        processes and of population ecology.  With this new equipment                   they will eliminate from the teaching curriculum the separation                 of ecology into ecosystem-based and population-based concepts and               instead, integrate both along the lines of biogeochemistry and                  trophic interactions.  To enhance this new teaching focus, they                 wish to create a more quantitative framework for those                          field/laboratory exercises which illustrate interactions between                abiotic and biotic components of terrestrial and aquatic model                  systems.  These instruments will be used by students to quantify                inorganic and organic precursors and products of organism                       activities, pigments of primary producers, and other important                  abiotic and biotic aspects of communities.  The field/laboratory                exercises made possible by this instrumentation will provide                    students a practical \"feel\" for the conceptual integration of two               important areas in ecology.  The grantee institution is matching                this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.",
