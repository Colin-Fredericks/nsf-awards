 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to establish a detailed three-                 dimensional description of the evolution of a typical                           extratropical cyclone, particularly the occlusion process.                      Within the scientific community there exist many different                      ideas about the nature of the occlusion process, a number of                    which stem from the original \"Norwegian cyclone\" model, a                       conceptual model developed in the early part of this century by                 Norwegian meteorologists.  Previous analyses have had to rely                   on sparse (and often inadequate) data from the conventional                     upper air observing network for diagnostic studies.  The                        results, while useful, have left open many questions.  In this                  study, the principal investigator will employ state-of-the-art                  mesoscale numerical models to analyze the three-dimensional                     structure of several simulated cyclone events.  The models                      provide high temporal and spatial resolution which will allow a                 much more comprehensive view of the cyclone evolution.  The                     principal investigator intends to look at the evolution of                      cyclones over both the ocean and the continent.",
