 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed will focus on a mechanistic model for                understanding simultaneous heat and water fluxes in porous media                such as fur, feathers or grasses or crops in outdoor                            environments.  Understanding heat and water fluxes is important                 because they are a critical part of an animal's capacity to grow                and reproduce.  Without a mechanistic understanding of these                    fluxes, empirical measurements must be made for each new                        situation.  This work is important because it will lead to                      understanding animal population and community dynamics and to                   understanding the influences of multiple low level stresses, such               as climate, disease and toxicants on those dynamics.  It also                   provides a fundamental basis for developing general microclimate                models for grasses and crops, which are \"home\" (constitute the                  microenvironments) for small vertebrates and invertebrates.                          Results from this research can also be applied to:  1)                     assessment of impact of climate change on animal growth and                     reproduction potential; 2) assessment of genetic engineering of                 changes in animal allometry of fur properties as it affects feed                efficiency for production of milk or meat; 3) assessment of                     different, more energy efficient domestic animal housing in                     different climates; 4) understanding aspects of the limits to                   animal distributions and how they might change for different                    climate change scenarios; 5) assessment of the impact of                        infectious diseases and low level toxicants on capacity of                      animals to grow and reproduce in different environments.",
