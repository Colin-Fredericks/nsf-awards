 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is the direct numerical                  simulation of heat transfer enhancement by resonant excitation of               Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities in flows such as those encountered           in air cooling of electronic equipment.  The resonant excitation will           be achieved by imposing an external excitation at a frequency equal to          the most unstable flow frequency, and by spontaneously supercritical            destabilization of the flow.  The proposed research will address the            issues of buoyancy and three-dimensionality which are present in                electronic cooling configurations.  In order to understand and                  quantify the physics of supercritical and resonant heat transfer                enhancement, it is proposed to develop an efficient hydrodynamic-heat           transfer numerical code based on the direct simulation of the                   unaveraged three-dimensional energy and Navier-Stokes equations using           a spectral element-Fourier method.  The numerical results from direct           simulations will permit to validate and further develop heat transfer           models, since computational modeling is still a fundamental tool of             analysis in engineering practice.",
