The main areas of                  this work are: a). Compartmental models with spatial diffusion                  and time delays and their application to the understanding of                   the effects of size, time delays, and other factors on the                      stability of certain biochemical processes in cells; b). models                 of epidemics which are based on the dynamics of actual diseases                 with particular emphasis on vertical transmission and on the                    effects of age-structure and other internal variables of a                      population on the dynamics behavior of these models; and c).                    the derivation of sharp bounds on the periods of oscillatory                    solutions of continuous and discrete dynamical systems and the                  derivation of conditions which rule out the possibility of                      periodic and more complicated dynamics.  The project will                       employ both analytical investigations and numerical methods                     that will be aimed at fitting the mathematical results to                       observed data.  All of these problems require the development                   of new techniques of analysis that can be applied to broad                      classes of equations that occur in modelling certain types of                   biological and physical phenomena.",
