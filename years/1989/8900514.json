 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is the systematic preparation of                     metal catalysts supported on composite oxides and the                           correlation of catalytic activity with the properties of the                    support.  In an agueous environment, metal oxides develop a                     surface charge; the pH at which the charge in zero is defined                   as the \"point of zero charge\" (pzc).  The pzc of pure silica                    and that of pure alumina are separated by about 4 units.                        Selective metal-support exchange uses the surface charge to                     attach catalyst precursors (metal salts) to the support; thus                   by adjusting the pH one can selectively introduce anionic or                    cationic catalyst precursors.  Furthermore, by preparing                        composite oxides of silica and alumina, one can, in principle                   at least, control the pzc.  In this study, supported cobalt                     catalysts are prepared from both anionic and (separately)                       cationic precursors on a series of silica/alumina composites,                   and the activities of the catalysts for butene hydrogenation                    and cyclopropane hydrogenolysis are correlated with the                         composition of the support and the method of preparation.                                                                                                       This work is an effort to introduce scientific principles and                   methods into preparation of supported catalysts; traditionally                  these are prepared using \"recipes\" that represent more of an                    art than a science.  The study is designed in such a way that                   it can serve as a \"template\" to obtain design data on a                         variety of systems.  The principles and approches involved are                  applicable to preparation of reactive ceramic membranes as                      well.",
