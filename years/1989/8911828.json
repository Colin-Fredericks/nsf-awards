 "awd_abstract_narration": "Democracy rests on the idea that citizens can influence the politics of         government through elections.  The usual way in which this is thought           to occur is that voters and candidates for office have positions on             political issues and voters choose the candidate whose position is              closest to their own.  This theory is called the proximity model                because liking for candidates is based on \"closeness\" on the issues.            Two important assumptions of the proximity model are (1) that people            have specific positions on issues and (2) that the positions on each            issue can be arrayed along a continuum.  For example, on the issue of           defense spending, each person has an exact level of spending he or she          most prefers.                                                                   But is this how voters think and behave?  Observers of politics have            stressed that many people do not care greatly about issues and their            views are often vague.  If this is the case, then the traditional               proximity model may not be appropriate for understanding the way in             which issues influence electoral choice.  According to the proximity            model, for example, candidates should take positions near the average           voter in their district and the candidate that comes closest to the             average voter should win the election.  Yet in the U.S. Congress many           representatives are more extreme than their districts and have defeated         opponents who were closer to the average voter.  The proximity model            cannot explain these outcomes.                                                  The researchers for this investigation have developed a different               theory about the way in which issues influence feelings toward                  candidates.  They argue that most issues are presented to the mass              public with two alternatives - - should defense spending be reduced or          not, should there be a death penalty or not, should there be new taxes          or not.  While other possible alternatives surely exist, two                    alternatives usually capture the political dialogue at any given time.          More formally, in this model voters choose the candidate who                    advocates the direction on the issue that they prefer and presents it           most effectively.                                                               This project will extend the investigator's research that they have             done in the United States to multiparty systems.  The theoretical               component of the project will involve deriving mathematically the               consequences of the directional model for the behavior of multiparty            systems.  The empirical component will center on analyzing electoral            competition in Norway.  The researchers selected Norway because it is a         fairly typical multiparty system and because appropriate questions to           test the two theories will appear on the 1989 Norwegian election                survey.  The entire cost of the survey will be borne by the Norwegian           government.                                                                     To date, theories of issue voting have focused almost exclusively on            two-party political systems.  This is a serious limitation because most         of the democracies of the world are multiparty proportional                     representation systems.  This research will enhance our understanding           of how parties attempt to position themselves strategically and what            this means for the nature of political competition in democracies.",
