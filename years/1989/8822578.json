 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Characterization of Air Currents in Relation to the           Sensory Physiology and Behavior of Spiders\" between Dr. Joseph A.               Humphrey of the University of California at Berkeley and Dr. F.G.               Barth of the University of Wien, Austria, is jointly approved by                NSF and the FWF of Austria under the US-Austria Cooperative Science             Program.                                                                                                                                                        The principal investigators propose a one-year program of research              to investigate macroscopic fluid mechanic observables affecting                 prey capture and the \"ballooning\" phenomena in spiders and the                  relation of these to microscopic aspects of air motion-sensilla                 interactions.  The highly interdisciplinary nature of this work                 combines the \"zoological\" expertise in Vienna and \"engineering\"                 expertise in Berkeley to advance knowledge in sensory physiology.               Work in Berkeley will address the measurement and physico-mathema-              tical modelling of the air motions relevant to behavior.  The                   characteristics of the flows that stimulate and maintain the                    ballooning activity, as well as prey capture, will be experimentally            determined in an especially constructed apparatus using laser-Doppler           anemometry and flow visualization techniques.  Time histories,                  averages and spectral frequency determinations of prescribed                    velocity fields will allow the investigators to elucidate the                   characteristics of the flows that elicit these activities.                      Theoretical work will focus on improving the fundamental under-                 standing, models and numerical predictability of the detailed                   distributions of velocity and pressure of such flows.  In particular,           various hypotheses advanced in a seminal paper by Humphrey \u01311987!               on the subject of ballooning will be rigorously checked.  Closed                form theoretical analysis will also be performed to model the                   response of the trichobothria sensilla, single or in groups, to                 natural fluctuations in the air flow.  From this, estimates will be             obtained of the forces that deflect the trichobothria, as well as               the magnitudes and directions of the deflections themselves.  Part              of the experimental instrumentation (but not the apparatus) and the             numerical procedures required to undertake this research are                    already available.  With the necessary upgrades and adaptations                 they can both be applied to a range of problems of interest here                and in related bio-fluid mechanics fields.  The significance of                 this work lies in the impact that the experimental and theoretical              findings will have in the fields of sensory physiology and                      biomechanics.",
