 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program is devoted to the synthesis and characterization of                 novel conductive and magnetic materials based on metal-organic                  (M(L)) complexes.  Section I of this proposal describes the study               of quasi one-dimensional molecular metals that are propared from                metalloporphyrins and phthalocyanines.  These show remarkable                   properties without parallel in other classes of material, in                    particular a new type of low-temperature condensation within an                 M(L) stack that exhibits a one-dimensional spine of metal-ion                   local moments embedded within the \"Fermi Sea\" of a conducting                   organic framework.                                                                                                                                              Section II describes the synthesis of planar surfur-encircled                   metallomacrocycles that can engage in highly three-dimensional                  interactions.  These compounds will also be used to prepare                     multi-metal porphyrin complexes and well-defined, two-dimensional               metal-linked polymers that will be studied as films and fibers.                                                                                                 Section III describes the preparation of new materials based on                 tris-dichalcogenide complexes of transition-metal ions.  These                  complexes provide inherently three-dimensional building blocks                  for the synthesis of molecular metals, superconductors and                      ferromagnets.",
