 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will supply shipboard scientific support equipment                 for the research vessel RIDGELY WARFIELD, operated by the Johns                 Hopkins University, Chesapeake Bay Institute, and dedicated to                  use in support of ocean science research.                                                                                                                       The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds               for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                      conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support                for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the                deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational                equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                        receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                          communication equipment including radio transceivers and                        satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                            communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                  for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                                                                                                   The Project Directors, Dr. James D. Ebert and Bruce K. Cornwall                 are fully qualified to direct this project having had                           considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and                       installation of shipboard equipment.                                                                                                                            This project will allow the institution to replace worn out                     connectors on the conducting winch, and replace a defective radar               and navigational equipment.",
