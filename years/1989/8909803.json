 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cross-modal transfer (CMT) occurs when a person (or animal)                     learns to perform a task in response to cues in one sensory                     modality (e.g., audition) and then learns an essentially similar                task in response to cues of a different modality (e.g., vision).                The rate of learning the second task is faster than it would be                 without having had the prior training experience.                                                                                                               Dr. Delay is studying the effects of post-injury, cross-modal                   transfer of learning on recovery of behavioral function following               brain damage.  His early studies have already shown, for example,               that prior training to an auditory stimulus aids in the recovery                of ability to detect a change in light intensity following damage               to the visual areas of the cerebral cortex.                                                                                                                     This research is helping us understand the more general                         conditions (e.g., cue characteristics) necessary for CMT to                     enhance behavioral recovery after brain injury.  These                          experiments also provide insights into brain-behavior                           relationships which, ultimately, will contribute to the                         foundation of clinical rehabilitation programs.",
