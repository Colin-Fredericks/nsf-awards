 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Professors W.V. Jones and J.P. Wefel, of                 Louisiana State University, and co-workers at the University of                 Alabama in Huntsville, the University of Washington, and the NASA               Marshall Space Flight Center to collaborate with Prof. Ogata, of the            University of Tokyo, and colleagues at other Japanese institutions              over a period of two years.  They will investigate nuclear inter-               actions, energy spectra, and chemical composition of cosmic rays                using long-duration balloon flights of one to two weeks.  In                    particular, detailed investigation will be made of the chemical                 composition of high density nuclear matter in these rays.                                                                                                       The purpose of this research is to study cosmic rays with energies              greater than those of any existing accelerators, in order to examine            the properties of particles produced by nuclei under the extreme                conditions of high temperature and compression that exist when they             collide in the form of cosmic rays.  New theories suggest that such             collisions may lead to new states of nuclear matter, including pion             condensation, abnormal nuclear matter, hot quark matter, and multi              quark states.  However, current accelerators do not possess enough              energy to lead to such states; at present, cosmic rays at altitudes             which may be reached by balloon are the only available sources of               particles with the energies required.  The information obtained                 should help clarify some basic physical and astrophysical processes             and will therefore be of international importance.  The Japanese                researchers will prepare and analyze the nuclear emulsions to be                used in the experiments, while the U.S. team will provide the balloons,         helium gas, and launch facilities.",
