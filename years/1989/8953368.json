 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Prince George's County Public Schools, the 15th largest district in         the country, will collaborate with the Prince George's County Economic          Development Corporation, Capitol College, and the Prince George's               Chamber of Commerce to form a Science, Mathematics, and Technology              Network.  This network will carry out a two-year program for elementary         and middle school teachers designed to improve their knowledge and              understanding of current science and mathematics applications and to            increase their creativity in teaching these subjects.  In this district         with a 70% minority student population, the long term goal is to                motivate more minority and female students to pursue science and                mathematics careers.                                                                                                                                            The first phase will consist of four components: (1) a one-week Summer          Science and Technology Institute, (2) a fall semester Science and               Technology Institute Applications course, (3) a spring semester                 Shadowing/Visiting Scientists-in-the-Classroom program, and (4) a summer        internship in business or industry.  Each teacher successfully                  completing Phase One will move into a second phase with two components:         (1) networking and (2) an alliance.  In Phase Two, Phase One                    participants will train colleagues and coordinate the development for           more stimulating and motivating approaches to science and mathematics.          By the end of two years this effort will have forged an                         interdisciplinary alliance of 400 teachers dedicated to strengthening           the teaching of science and motivating student interest.                                                                                                        Cost sharing by the partners will total more than 100% of the NSF               funding.",
