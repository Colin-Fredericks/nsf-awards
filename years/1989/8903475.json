 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biostratigraphic analysis of Late Devonian, Frasnian                       conodont sequences in Euramerica has led to a thirteen-fold                     zonation in the Montagne Noire, France and a different twelve-                  fold zonation in the Alberta Rockies.  A correlation hypothesis                 derived from graphic correlation resolves the differences between               the two sequences and allows development of a semi-quantitative                 composite range chart, consisting of 34 composite-standard units.               Testing and modification of this standard will be pursued using                 data from other sequences in Euramerica and the recently acquired               collections from Australia, where Montagne Noire zones 3-13 have                been identified in preliminary analysis.  The Australian sequence               will provide a crucial location for an ongoing comprehensive                    analysis of Frasnian conodont biogeography.  Underpinning these                 studies is a taxonomic base developed from multielement taxonomy                and shape analysis.  The former was the major taxonomic                         breakthrough of the 1960s, which has had little impact on                       Frasnian conodont studies at the species level until the research               carried out under PI's previous grants.  Shape analysis,                        especially automated outline analysis, has the potential to                     quantify evolutionarily significant morphologic characters and                  transform many of the subjective aspects of taxonomy into a                     precise methodology.",
