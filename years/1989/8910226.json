 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program of Dr. Jacobson is primarily on quantumgravity.                The research involves several facets of that subject:  1)                       Conceptual problems of extending the probabilisticinterpretation                of quantum theory to quantum gravity will bestudied; 2) The                     difficulty of applying the usual framework ofquantization to a                  system with vanishing hamiltonian will beanalyzed with the help                 of a class of simple models; 3) Spacetime slicings which render                 the hamiltonian of general relativity positive will be studied;                 4) Discrete models of spacetime will be studied from two points                 of view:  a) Hints will be sought from all quarters as to the                   possible nature of discrete spacetime, including black hole                     thermodynamics, energy-momentum conservation requirements and                   interpretive requirements of quantum theory; b) The properties of               specific discrete spacetime models (spin networks, causal                       sets,...) will be explored.                                                          Broadly speaking, this research is motivated by the belief                 that the problem of quantum gravity fundamentally requires a                    quantum theory of spacetime itself, as opposed to aquantization                 of classical gravity.",
