 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last few years there has been an explosion of new data               sets and empirical studies of these data focused on the size                    distribution of firms, turnover (entry and exit of firms),                      growth and size of firms and the variability of firms'                          employment.  The purpose of this project is to develop economic                 models that can rigorously compare the time series and cross                    section data on industry behavior now available.  These models                  will ultimately be useful for predictions and policy                            evaluations.                                                                                                                                                    More specifically, past competitive industry analysis                           by the investigator is extended to a dynamic stochastic                         framework. Capital investment decisions are included in the                     stationary equilibrium analysis to permit the analysis of the                   impact of economic policies on the rate of turnover of firms,                   size distribution and variability of employment.  The general                   competitive industry dynamic theory is extended to account for                  aggregate uncertainty and capital accumulation.  This theory                    provides a dynamic programming algorithm.                                                                                                                       The project also analyzes diffusion of technological change and                 growth in the presence of technological complementarities and                   specific (putty clay) forms of capital, in a general equilibrium                framework.  The dynamic properties of the growth model are                      analyzed, focusing on understanding how the existing distribution               of specific capital affects the introduction of new                             technologies; the role of expectations in the diffusion of new                  technologies; joint implications between innovation, diffusion                  and growth; and a model on the diffusion of organization                        capital.                                                                                                                                                        This project is important because it fills a gap in the                         industrial organization literature.  In contrast to the vast                    empirical work in this field, there have been very few attempts                 to develop economic models on the dynamics of industry behavior                 with implications on entry, the rate of turnover, exit and size                 distribution of firms.  The results of the research should                      provide new insights into a number of extremely significant                     issues such as how equilibrium prices, turnover, concentration,                 etc. evolve in an industry as a consequence of a change in demand               or the evolution of new industries or the implications of changes               in demand for the evolution of a declining industry.",
