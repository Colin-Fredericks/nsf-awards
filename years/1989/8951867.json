 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the essential components of versatile laser                     spectrometer is assembled that enables our chemistry major to carry out         experiments in Raman spectroscopy, time-resolved absorption                     spectroscopy, and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.  The total           system includes both a pulsed nitrogen laser and a dye laser, as well           as a monochromator, a signal processor, and a laboratory computer to            store and analyze the data.  The spectrometer is used to introduce              students to several phenomena and techniques which are important to             current research in chemistry.  These include (a) principles and                applications of lasers, (b) techniques for measuring very fast                  processes, and (c) computer interfacing and control of experiments.             This also provides an opportunity for our chemistry majors to use               state-of-the-art laser equipment for independent research projects.             The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of               funds.",
