 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continuing support for a Research Experiences               for Undergraduates Site administered through the School for Field               Studies.  This program will train eight students in research                    methods and theory of Primate Social Behavior and Ecology at The                School For Field Studies training site in Catemaco, Veracruz                    State, Mexico.  During the summer, students will take a 30 day                  course in which they will conduct directed and individual                       research projects on stumptail macaques, Macaca arctoides. Daily                lectures and computer/statistics laboratory sessions help                       students design their projects, collect data, analyze those data,               and interpret their results within a scientific framework.                      Projects will focus on one of three areas: (1) influences of                    observers on social interactions, (2) social ecological analyses                and (3) fine grained analyses of patterns of courtship and                      mating.  Tentative statistical analyses of the data, a                          preliminary paper, and an oral report are completed at the end of               each course.  During the academic year following the field                      course, students take independent study courses at their home                   institution in which they analyze and write up the results of                   their research with the senior faculty member.  By the end of the               academic year following the field course, students submit a paper               describing the results of their project for publication.  A                     similar one year REU site proposal, funded in 1988 and now at its               midpoint, has proven successful.",
