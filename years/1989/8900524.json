 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Psychology at The                Pennsylvania State University to establish a Research Experiences               for Undergraduates Site.  Eight undergraduate psychology majors                 with an interest in the biological aspects of experimental                      psychology will be recruited to participate in this program at                  the completion of their sophomore year.  An effort will be made                 to attract a majority of minority students using the techniques                 and contacts which have enabled the Department to train 40                      minority Ph.D.s since 1969.  The students selected will work as                 apprentices with one of five members of the faculty, all                        nationally known for their research and all highly experienced at               training graduate students and undergraduates who have gone on to               graduate school.  Last year these same five faculty members                     received a large equipment grant from the U.S. Department of                    Education.  Therefore, the facilities available in these                        laboratories for research and training in psychophysiology are                  the equal of any university in the country.  Faculty mentors will               work full-time with these students during the summer after their                sophomore year, gradually exposing them to all aspects of                       psychophysiological research.  Students will begin an independent               experiment during the latter part of the summer and complete it                 with the help of their Penn State mentor during their junior                    year.  Near the end of their junior year the students will                      present their research at a department colloquium.",
