 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Gralla plans to develp and apply methods that alow in situ                  probing of SV40 DNA-protein regulatory complexes.  Enzymes and                  chemicals will be introduced into transcriptionally active                      mammalian cells so that the active DNA becomes modified or                      broken.  After isolation of the DNA the pattern of modification                 is determined by primer extension analysis, and this may be                     interpreted in terms of in situ interactions when compared to                   appropriate controls.  Comparisons will be made to patterns                     from disrupted, transcriptinally inactive cells, and to SV40                    genomes inactivated by mutation.  In this way, a model will be                  constructed to describe the state of functional SV40                            nucleoprotein complexes in vivo.  The changes in these                          complexes that accompany the programmed switch from SV40 Early                  to Late transcription will also be probed.  Particular                          attention will be paid to the role of DNA replication in                        allowing new factors to bind DNA as part of this genetic                        program.  Overall, then, the goal is to describe how SV40                       regulatory DNA is used in vivo as part of the transcriptional                   program of the virus.                                                                                                                                           This research provides the perfect complement to in  vivo                       experiments probing DNA - protein interactions ongoing in many                  labs.  Various methods have been developed and authenticated                    for probing DNA - protein interactions in situ in living cells.                 It is crucial to know whether the in vitro experiments truly                    minimize the in  vivo.",
