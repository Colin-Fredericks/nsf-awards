 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Chemical Society requests support for a                       two-year Young Scholars program involving 40 high-potential                     Native American, Hispanic, or Black high school students at                     the following four institutions:  Northern Arizona                              University, Montana College of Mineral Science and                              Technology, University of Texas at San Antonio, and Florida                     International University.                                                            The program, to be run in cooperation with the highly                      praised ACS Project SEED program, will begin with                               eight-week summer research projects for the students at the                     above institutions.  Eligible students will be expected to                      present a poster paper on their research at the fall                            meeting of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and                      Native Americans in Science. ACS will provide travel grants                     for this purpose.  The Society will also offer grants of up                     to  $300/teacher to encourage high school teachers of the                       participating students to  attend the 11th Biennial                             Chemical Education Conference to be held in Atlanta,                            Georgia in the summer of 1990.  Each student will receive a                     one-year, free subscription to CHEM MATTERS and free                            membership in the ACS student affiliates, with all the                          attendant benefits, for their first year in college.                                 Following the summer program, the Society, working                         through its Career  Publications program, Project SEE, the                      four colleges and universities, and the  ACS local sections                     involved, will organize science career programs and other                       outreach programs for the high schools of the ACS Young                         Scholars.",
