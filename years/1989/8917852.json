 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marquette University College of Engineering will establish a              broad-based educational opportunity program to attract undergraduate            minority students to engineering, to retain them in engineering                 programs through degree completion, and to prepare them for research            careers.  The Research Careers for Minority Scholars program will rely          on the College's strong academic programs in Biomedical, Civil,                 Mechanical, Industrial, Electrical and Computer Engineering; its                quality faculty; its state-of-the-art facilities; its partnership with          industry; and its tradition in successfully training minority                   students.  The College will select 16 outstanding minority scholars             over the four-year grant period to participate in a program that                combines academic-year course work, research project work, and 10-week          summer enrichment programs.  The enrichment activities are designed to          establish a successful transition for freshmen students, to promote a           long-term interest in engineering, and to immerse students in                   engineering research.  As its key components, the program provides              financial assistance; nurtures academic success and personal growth             through mentorship, role model, and advising programs; offers unique            opportunities for developing independent research skills through                project work in academic and industrial settings; fosters a personal            identification with the engineering profession; and offers the                  encouragement, preparation, and assistance necessary to enter programs          of graduate study.",
