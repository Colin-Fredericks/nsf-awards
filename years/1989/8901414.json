The particular aspects which it                    involves can be described as follows:  (1) Incorporate the                      study of certain discrete groups, such as arithmetic groups and                 mapping class groups, to an existing program based on applying                  methods from modular representation theory to group actions.                    (2) Determine general properties of the cohomology of finite                    groups, and how, using equivariant cohomology, this influences                  the role they play as transformation groups.  (3) Obtain                        necessary and sufficeint conditions for a finite group to act                   freely on a product of spheres, and analyze the restrictions                    this imposes on the homology representations when they are of                   the same dimension.  This work is aimed at approaching a global                 conjecture on the free rank of symmetry of a finite complex.                    (4) Use theory of infinite loop spaces and invariant theory to                  obtain precise cohomological information on the symmetric                       groups, with several applications in mind.  They include                        describing the cohomology of certain double covers of the                       symmetric groups which serve as finite models for a space which                 detects important characteristic classes.  Other applications                   to stable homotopy and group cohomology are also planned.  The                  invariant theory used is seen as an interesting and important                   algebraic problem in its own right, encoding most of the                        cohomological structure of the symmetric groups.                                     In other words, the various parts of this project all                      concern the symmetry of geometric objects.  Algebraic tools for                 making calculations about symmetry will be perfected, and these                 tools will then be applied to answer natural questions.",
