 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Fleischaker is undertaking an 18 month research and training                postdoctoral program with Dr. Richard Lewontin of Harvard                       University.  The center of her study and research is a program to               define living systems operationally.  What may seem to be                       something obvious, i.e. whether something is \"alive\" or not,                    becomes very problematic in areas of science like virology or in                attempts to determine whether life exists on other planets.                     Investigators who are trying to determine how life arose on this                planet also need to have a clear definition of what it means to                 be \"alive.\"  By working with Professor Lewontin, one of the                     leading geneticists in the world, Dr. Fleischaker will attempt to               show the necessity for defining life in origins-of-life research,               extraterrestrial investigations, virology, and cybernetics,                     making a broad case for system-operational criteria of what                     constitutes being \"alive.\"  She will then attempt to make                       explicit the assumptions underlying contemporary origins-of-life                research, pointing to the strengths of the minimal-system                       approach emerging as a recent branch from the traditional lines                 of research in this area.  Finally, she will treat the active                   interchange across the boundary of any living system as necessary               from its embeddedness in the immediate surroundings.  She                       questions the notion of autonomy of living systems in the light                 of ecological nestedness, and hopes to provide an operational                   definition of \"the individual\" (as opposed to the traditional                   morphological definition of \"organism\") in the context of                       symbiotic relationships, extending their different degrees of                   spatial intimacy to local and global communities.",
