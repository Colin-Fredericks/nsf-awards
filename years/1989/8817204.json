 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator, Herman Chernoff, will continue his work in               sequential analysis. One problem is that of deciding the sign of                m, the drift of Brownian motion. Assuming the cost of a wrong                   decision to be independent of m and the sampling cost to be                     proportional to time multiplied by the square of the drift for                  bounded sampling time. Chernoff will examine the effect of normal               priors and mixtures of normal and point mass priors form.                       Another problem to be investigated is that of serial dependence                 in quality control.  Chernoff will also examine a robust method                 for the problem of missing explanatory variables in a regression                model.  In the area of simulation the Chernoff will study the                   asymptotic validity of the \"bootstrap\" method as well as a two-                 stage approximation of a posterior distribution.  It is hoped                   that these and other statistical methods will prove useful in                   problems in astronomy.  He will also study the possibility of                   applying data analytic and pattern recognition techniques to the                identification of common subsequences in long strings that occur                in biological problems.",
