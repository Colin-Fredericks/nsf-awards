The IEEE Region 10                            comprises countries of South East Asia, far East and                            Australasia, including India, Pakistan, Japan, South Korea,                     Taiwan, Hong Kong, PR China, Singapore, Indonesia,                              Phillipines, Australia and New Zealand.  The meeting will                       have representatives from most of these countries and also                      from various regions in India.                                                  The organizers include some of the U.S. and India's leaders                     in electrical, electronics and communication engineering.                       They also have as advisors experts from major U.S.                              laboratories in industry and academia, as well as others                        from Europe and Japan.                                                                                                                                          Scope:  Region 10 of the IEEE has a large potential for                         high technology in terms of manpower which will greatly                         benefit from this conference.  The U.S. stands to gain from                     tapping scientific advances in the region in areas such as                      probability and statistics and their applications to                            eletronics and communications, including control theory and                     signal processing.  The U.S. participants will interact                         with leading research organizations in India, and learn of                      specific problems in technology, adaptation and research                        efforts in developing countries' settings.",
