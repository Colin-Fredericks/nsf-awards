 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three themes of classical harmonic analysis will be                        developed in this mathematical research project.  The problems to               be investigated center on discrete decomposition techniques under               recent development.                                                                  The first area will focus on Littlewood-Paley theory.  A                   generalization of the fundamental ideas of Fourier series in                    which functions or distributions are represented as combinations                of simple functions.  The map from the source function to the                   corresponding sequence of coefficients is called the phi-                       transform, the Fourier transform being perhaps the best known                   example.  One application of this study will be to develop                      criteria for an extension of the T(1) theorem of David and Journe               which gives precise boundedness conditions for singular linear                  operators solely on the basis of their action on constant                       functions.                                                                           Other work will develop the close connection between                       Littlewood-Paley theory and weighted norm inequalities,                         especially to factorization and extrapolation for classes of                    weights much larger than the traditional Ap weights.  One of the                motivations for such studies comes from efforts to find sharp                   conditions on weights for the Fourier transform to be bounded.                  To study such inequalities, one must localize on the frequency                  side and time side simultaneously.  Littlewood-Paley theory and                 the phi-transform are designed to deal with such problems.                           Discrete Littlewood-Paley theory has proved to be very                     useful in seismic and acoustic analysis, psycho-physiology,                     computer vision and image processing as well as in quantum field                theory.  Much of the algorithm development for computational work               in these areas requires sampling techniques.  This work will                    seek to develop characterizations of efficient sampling processes               associated with these algorithms.",
