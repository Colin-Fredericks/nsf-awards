 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Oceanography at Oregon State University has                      requested several items of oceanographic instrumentation to                     be placed in a pool of shared use equipment.  This equipment                    is maintained for use on or in association with the R/V                         WECOMA, a research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by                      the University.  A substantial part of the ship's operating                     schedule during 1989 is in support of NSF-sponsored research                    projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the capabi-                   lities of the ship and of the institution to support research                   and engineering activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                      -an upgrade for an autoanalyzer that measures a variety of                        chemical constituents in seawater,                                            -a back-up command unit for an acoustic doppler current                           profiler,                                                                     -replacement sampling bottles for collecting discrete                            seawater samples at depth,                                                     -a CTD for profiling Conductivity and Temperature as a                           function of Depth,                                                             -an elemental analyzer for routine shipboard use,                               -an upgrade for a multi-user sediment trap, and                                 -an ultra-cold freezer for storing samples awaiting analysis.                                                                                                   The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the University to support NSF-sponsored                           research and engineering projects.",
