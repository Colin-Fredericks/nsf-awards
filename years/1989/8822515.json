 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Structural Analyses of Zeolites, Molecular                    Sieves and Related Materials\" between Dr. Richard M. Kirchner of                Manhattan College and Prof. Walter M. Meier of the Institute for                Crystallography, Zurich, Switzerland, is jointly approved by NSF                and the Swiss National Science Foundation under the U.S.-Switzerland            Cooperative Science Program.                                                                                                                                    Solving the structure of a new molecular sieve often takes many                 years using a combination of presently available techniques.  A                 new approach (the Bennett/Schomaker method) has already been                    successful in solving the structures of four unknown molecular                  sieves.  However, this method needs to be expanded to work in all               space groups for a variety of framework materials of various                    chemical composition.  This proposal would bring together experts               who together could develop a more powerful and useful program.                                                                                                  Specifically, the researchers of two new aluminophosphate framework             materials (KAPPA and ALPO4-11) will be characterized from X-ray                 powder diffraction data.  Knowledge of the KAPPA structure will                 enable a comparison of chemically substituted frameworks of                     similar topology to be made.  A well characterized structure of                 ALPO4-11 would provide details of the interaction between the                   aluminophosphate framework and the organic template used to                     synthesize this material.  In addition, since not many well                     characterized structures of aluminophosphate framework materials are            known, each new structure is of considerable interest in order to               understand the properties of this new family of materials (including            chemically substituted ones) that have great potential for                      commercial application.",
