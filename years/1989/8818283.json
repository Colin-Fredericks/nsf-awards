This is part of a comprehensive plan                to improve organized research in science and technology                         throughout the Island which has received support from the NSF                   sponsored Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research                (EPSCoR).                                                                         The prime objective is to provide a link to NSFNET for                        researchers at the Rio Piedras, Mayaguez, and Medical Science                   Campuses of the UPR, and the National Astronomy and Ionosphere                  Center at the Arecibo Observatory.  The connection will also                    provide access to and promote the development of linkages with                  major research and academic networks on the mainland.  Access to                NSFNET will be eventually expanded to all researchers on the                    Island as well as other Caribbean institutions.                                   The NSF funding will supply seed money to purchase gateway                    equipment for each node and a satellite link to the mainland                    connected to an appropriate NSFNET Backbone Node.  The                          University will provide for network operations and information                  services for the intra-Island network - UPRENET. ***",
