 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major role for hearing in many animals is communication.  There               is evidence that many animal brains have nerve cells or nerve                   circuits that are in some way specifically \"tuned\" to recognize                 particular timing, duration, or pattern of sounds such as mating                calls.  Crickets have provided very useful models for                           investigation because they have single, identifiable nerve cells                that are accessible for physiological recording.                                                                                                                This project investigates the roles that individual nerve cells                 play in controlling the female cricket's recognition of and                     response to acoustic signals from the male.  The anatomy and                    encoding properties of single cells will be determined using                    synthetic calls with variable parameters.  Methods are developed                to simultaneously record from single cells while the animal is                  actively behaving, turning toward the recognized sound source.                  Powerful new techniques for inactivation of single cells then                   will be used with a behavioral assay to determine the role of                   those single cells in the call recognition and response.  The                   influences of hormones on these cells and on the behaviors also                 will be tested.                                                                                                                                                 Results will establish the cellular circuitry underlying this                   response behavior, and will be exciting to auditory scientists,                 and also should be interesting to those working on signal coding,               neural circuits, or communication behavior.  Results may also be                relevant to aspects of insect biology and control.",
