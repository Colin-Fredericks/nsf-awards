 "awd_abstract_narration": "This career advancement award will permit Dr. Lenore J. Weitzman                to initiate a major new line of inquiry on the role of property                 in modern society.  The ultimate goal of scientific research in                 this area is to illuminate changes in the legal and cultural                    conceptions of property over time.  This could very well be a                   pathbreaking endeavor:  First, this work aims to address how                    property is defined, including a wide variety of forms of \"new\"                 property such as ideas and other creative assets, investments in                human capital and future earnings capacity, and pensions. Second,               it envisions examining how property is distributed in the United                States, including measures of the \"new property.\"  Third, the                   research plans to relate this inquiry to how property and income                are allocated, managed, and controlled in family units.  And,                   finally, this agenda of study focuses directly on the role of law               in shaping how marital property is held and how decisions about                 property are made.                                                                                                                                              This support is crucial to future work on the transformation of                 property and to the career advancement of this investigator.                    Although Dr. Weitzman brings substantial expertise to studying                  this problem, greater knowledge of property law, legal history,                 and economics--to be developed under this career advancement                    award--is essential.  Also, a pilot study is necessary in order                 to assess the feasibility of empirical work on the transformation               of property and to develop the methodologies to map out the                     range, scope, and impact of  the \"new\" property on society and                  within families in particular.  Finally, coincident with the                    goals of the career advancement initiative, this award provides                 an opportunity for this investigator, who has not yet been                      evaluated for tenure, to embark on a promising new line of work.",
