 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcription and replication of influenza viral genomic RNAs                   are mediated by a unique virus coded polymerase that consists                   of three polypeptide subunits, namely, PB1, PB2 and PA.  The                    synthetic steps catalyzed by viral polymerase, which are also                   influenced by other viral and cellular proteins, are not                        well understood.  Temperature sensitive (ts) mutants of                         influenza virus that are defective in transcription and                         replication will be systematically analyzed for specific                        defects in nuclear transport, polymerase complex formation,                     polymerase RNP complex formation and catalytic function using                   the recently developed reagents and methodologies.  The                         mechanism of anti-termination mediated by nucleoprotein (NP)                    in the  synthesis of full length cRNA templates will be                         examined to determine if free uncomplexed NP binds to nascent                   cRNA strands to facilitate this step.  In vitro translated                      NP and polymerase proteins will be used in vitro reactions to                   determine if free NP alone can cause antitermination and if                     individual P proteins can complement ts functions in vitro.                                                                                                     This study will provide us an unique opportunity to                             understand how the viral polymerase subunits interact with                      each other and with other viral components to perform many                      complex functions in an infected cell.  Since influenza virus                   transcription/replication differs markedly from non-segmented                   negative strand viruses like VSV, detailed study of its                         replication may reveal many yet unidentified strategies                         employed by viruses in general, and will provide valuable                       comparative data.",
