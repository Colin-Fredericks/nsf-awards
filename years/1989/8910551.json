 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support preliminary phases of a project,                    the objective of which is to determine the optimal process for                  removal of mercury from wastewater treatment plant effluents.                    The project involves evaluation of alternative processes for                   removal of mercury following a preliminary step to                              characterize the metal-form of mercury remaining in the                         wastewater after conventional treatment.  Subsequent steps                      will include modeling of the potential systems and                              consideration of their effect on the base treatment concept.                                                                                                    The objective of this project is to facilitate preliminary                      studies to address the problem of the undesirable                               environmental impact on receiving waters of mercury-                            concentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluents.  The                    proposal leading to this award was submitted for consideration                  as a Research Planning Grant under conditions outlined in NSF                   87-56, Research Opportunities for Women.",
