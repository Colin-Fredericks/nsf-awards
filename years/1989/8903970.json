 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human nuclear U6 RNA is presumably tanscribed by polymerase                     III unlike the other abundant snRNAs involved in pre-mRNA                       splicing.  However the 5' flanking regions of U6 genes from a                   variety of organisms contain transcription control elements                     that appear to be very similar to those employed on pol II-                     transcribed U1 and U2 genes.  Moreover, unlike typical pol                      III genes, no internal control elements have been found in                      the U6 snRNA gene.  In one project a detailed analysis will                     be made of the transcription control elements in the proximal                   region of a human U6 gene.  Experiments are proposed that use                   in vitro transcription and experession in vivo from                             transfected genes to investigate the promoter element(s) that                   cause the U6 gene to be transcribed by RNA polymerase III.                      The U6 \"basal\" promoter situated in the 5' proximal region                      appears to be rigidly constrained with respect to the                           relative spacing and/or orientation of control elements.  The                   role of spacing will be studied in detail through the                           construction of a series of deletion and insertion mutants in                   the U6 gene promoter.  The mechanism of U6 transcription will                   also be studied by partial purification of trans-acting                         factors.  A S100 extract that supports accurate U6                              transcription will fractionated through several                                 chromatographic steps.  Direct transcription assays and DNA-                    protein binding analyses such as DNase footprinting will be                     used to characterize the partially purified factors.                                                                                                            The central focus of this application is the control of human                   U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) transcription.  This snRNA is a                    cofactor in pre-messenger RNA splicing, a fundamental step of                   gene expression in eukaryotic cells.",
