 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing use of \"hubs\" as switching centers through which large          volumes of traffic are channelled has transformed the character of many         transportation and communications networks.  Scholars in geography,             regional science, operations research, and related fields have recently         given more attention on the role of hubs in circulation networks, but           most studies conducted to date have focused on the characteristics of           individual nodes rather than on the entire network.  This research              project will build on work already completed by the investigator that           enhances theoretical models of spatial interaction.  These improvements         will determine the number and location of hubs that would best serve a          network and the best routing of flows through the network.  The                 research will combine extension of mathematical models to accommodate           additional factors that more accurately reflect actual conditions               within which networks function, the development of heuristic                    procedures for better determining solutions for such complex models,            and the analyses of graphic representations of networks to measure the          connectivity and efficiency of alternative networks.  The project will          set the stage for empirical analyses of hub systems in a variety of             different types of networks.                                                         This project will significantly advance theoretical understandings         of the roles of hubs within circulation systems by more realistically           representing network configurations and operations and by assessing hub         operations from perspectives of overall network efficiency.  Previous           work by the investigator along this line of inquiry already has been a          catalyst for new studies by other scholars examining spatial                    interaction and other locational factors; this project will continue to         foster that kind of advancement.  This research ultimately will also            yield practical rewards, by providing an improved basis for assessing           the operation of real circulation networks and by encouraging                   development of new procedures for determining optimal configurations of         new networks.",
