 "awd_abstract_narration": "Major earthquakes can cause severe damage to buildings                          resulting in thousands of fatalities and considerable                           societal disruption.  An innovative earthquake resistant                        construction concept, the Friction Pendulum System (FPS),                       shows excellent potential for reducing earthquake damage for                    new and existing buildings.                                                                                                                                     This research project investigates applying this earthquake                     resistant technique to buildings.  Dynamic analyses are used                    to identify the design parameters appropriate for different                     building applications, and to investigate the performance of                    building with the FPS when subjected to different earthquake                    strengths.  Materials which could achieve the desired dynamic                   coefficients of friction are identified and investigated.                                                                                                       It is anticipated that the FPS system could increase the                        earthquake resistance of the buildings by 100% to 300%,                         without increasing construction.  The system could also                         substantially increase the earthquake resistance of existing                    buildings with less retrofit disruption and at a lower cost                     than other methods.  Because of the inherent simplicity,                        versatility, stability, and durability of the FPS concept,                      if should become a major tool for seismic resistant design.                                                                                                     This research project represents Phase I of a Small Business                    Innovation Research Grant.",
