 "awd_abstract_narration": "They will study donor impurity levels in semiconductors by                      photoemission spectroscopy.  Concentrations as low as one part in               10-6 will be studied with meV energy resolution, at a photon                    energy near 5 eV.  Many systems will be studied.  The                           Silicon:Phosphorus system is emphasized.  One set of experiments                will use the surface sensitivity of the photoemission technique                 to study impurity levels near surfaces.  The large effective                    hydrogenic radius of 20 A for Phosphorus and Silicon should                     result in a significantly defferent binding energy of the                       Phosphorus levels near the surface than in the bulk.  This study                will produce the first experimental observation of this surface                 binding enrgy shift.  A second set of experiments will exploit                  the unique power of photoemission spectroscopy to directly                      observe the one electron density of occupied levels and study                   impurity band formation as a function of concentration.  The                    concentration range near the metal/insulator critical                           concentration (3x10-18/cm3 for Silicon:Phosphorus) will be                      emphasized.  This study will show the electronic density of                     states directly, and determine the bandwidth and Fermi level                    position as functions of concentration.",
