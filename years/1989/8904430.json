 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regulation of heme biosynthesis in nitrogen-fixing soybean                  root nodules is being studied as a means of understanding how the               bacterial symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum interacts with the                  plant to regulate metabolic processes essential for symbiosis.                  Bacterial heme is believed to be the prosthetic group of the                    plant nodule protein leghemoglobin, hence heme and apoprotein                   synthesis by the respective orgainism must be coordinated during                leghemoglobin formation.  Experiments will elucidate the exact                  role of the B. japonicum heme biosynthetic pathway in                           leghemoglobin formation, and deterine how heme synthesis genes                  are regulated during nodule development  Specific objectives are                to (i) isolate B. japonicum heme synthesis mutants, (ii)                        determine the effects of the bacterial heme synthesis lesions on                leghemoglobin synthesis, (iii) isolate and characterize B.                      japonicum heme synthesis genes, and (iv) study the regulation of                heme synthesis genes by nodule-associated factors and by                        bacterial regulatory protein.  Finally, the regulation of                       bacterial heme synthesis will be correlated with leghemoglobin                  formation.                                                                                                                                                      Biological nitrogen fixation is important because it is an                      inexpensive and environmentally-sound source of nitrogen                        fertilizer.  Understanding plant-microbe interactions at the                    molecular level is important in any attempt to improve the                      symbiosis or to extend it to other plants by genetic engineering.               The study of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum/soybean interaction                   will provide a better understanding of interkingdom                             commmunication as well as contribute to the body of knowledge of                heme biosynthesis in general, of which there is surprisingly                    little genetic information considering the ubiquity of this                     pathway in nature.",
