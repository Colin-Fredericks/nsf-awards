 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Magnus is examining the role of natural history in the                      American development of ecology, especially as this tradition                   developed in California.  He argues that the importance of                      natural history has been misunderstood by both historians and                   philosophers of science.  The role that a number of natural                     historians such as D. S. Jordan, G. H. Gilbert, and J. Grinnell                 played in the development of evolutionary ecology has been                      largely ignored in the literature on the American development of                ecology.  Similarly, natural history's significance for                         philosophical issues relating to theory structure and evidential                support, has not been fully appreciated.                                                                                                                        Working with Prof. James Griesemer at the University of                         California at Davis, Dr. Magnus is examining a biogeographically                oriented tradition in evolutionary animal ecology.  This                        tradition ran from Jordan's work (along with his contemporaries)                on geographical barriers and the role of isolation in speciation,               through the work of Joseph Grinnell at the Museum of Vertebrate                 Zoology in Berkeley on the influence of environmental factors on                distribution.  This primarily West Coast tradition advanced many                concepts and insights which were influential in the development                 of ecology.  In addition to producing a fuller historical                       understanding of the development of biology, particularly                       ecology, a treatment of this research tradition will correct many               philosophical views about the status of natural history.  Natural               history does have a theoretical component, and its practitioners                often had good evidence for their theoretical views.  In general,               natural history was significantly more sophisticated that                       historians and philosophers have claimed.",
