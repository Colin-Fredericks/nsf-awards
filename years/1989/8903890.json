 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under his previous award, Dr. Pedlosky and his colleagues                  have made important theoretical advances in research related to                 two general themes.  The first is a continuing effort to better                 understand the dynamics of baroclinic instability in both                       linear and nonlinear theories, with special emphasis on the                     phenomena of vacillation and chaotic behavior.  The research                    involves the use of idealized two-layer models to illuminate                    fundamental wave processes and the results are applicable to                    both atmospheric and oceanic dynamics.  The second broad area                   involves the development of a basic theory for the general                      oceanic circulation, in particular, the thermocline and its                     extension of the equatorial regions.                                                 Under this award, Dr. Pedlosky will extend his previous                    results, using both analytical and numerical techniques.  Five                  topics will be investigated:  (1) the behavior of localized                     instabilities in zonally inhomogeneous flows,  (2) wave-wave                    interaction under strongly nonlinear conditions,  (3) the role                  of the dissipation mechanism in the wave evolution,  (4) the                    relationship of the Equatorial Undercurrent to other                            circulations at the western boundary of ocean basins, and  (5)                  the effect of steeply sloping topography on the dynamics and                    structure of oceanic western boundary currents.  Support for                    this research is                                                                provided jointly by the Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology and                     Physical Oceanography Programs.",
