 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolutionary significance of sex is a central problem in               evolutionary ecology.  There has been a proliferation of models                 which predict the relative benefits of sexual vs. asexual                       reproduction but few empirical tests exist.  The goal of this                   research is to provide just such a test, using the forest                       bryophyte, Tetraphis pellucida.  Bryophytes are ideal systems in                which to test hypotheses concerning the effectiveness of sexual                 or asexual reproduction in different environments since they                    exhibit a high degree of habitat specificity and wide array of                  reproductive modes.                                                                  It has been demonstrated that levels of genetic variability                in some asexual species are equivalent to those of sexual                       species.  Asexual reproduction does not necessarily yield reduced               genetic variability, especially in those organisms in which the                 germ line is not isolated from somatic mutation.  The traditional               view that sex enhances fitness through the creation of genetic                  diversity may be inappropriate in bryophytes.                                        The long-term goal of this research is to examine the                      possibility that somatic non-germ cell mutation, as a source of                 genetic variability, may equal or exceed that of sexual                         recombination in mosses.  Certain background information is                     required prior to such an investigation.  This Research Planning                Grant would permit Dr. Kimmerer to complete preliminary studies                 and to develop methods which would support the long-term goal.                  The activities proposed here constitute essential preparation for               a major research effort.",
