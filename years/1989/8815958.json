Trogler of the University of California at San Diego                 will study the synthesis, structure and reaction mechanisms of                  17-electron organometallic radicals as part of this project                     within the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry                 Program. The goal is to develop catalysts for new chemical                      transformations that could be applied to the synthesis of                       specialty chemicals and medicinal compounds. Another thrust of                  the project is the investigation of late transition metal                       coordination complexes as possible reagents for the activation                  of nitrogen-hydrogen and oxygen-hydrogen bonds in order to                      facilitate insertion of unsaturated organic compounds such as                   olefins into the metal-nitrogen and metal-oxygen bonds,                         respectively. This area is also aimed at better defining the                    requirements for catalytic addition of ammonia, amines and                      alcohols to carbon-carbon double bonds.                                                                                                                         Compounds to be employed in the first part of the project                       are neutral electron rich 18-electron complexes which can be                    electrochemically oxidized to give stable or short-lived                        cationic radicals. Representative of these are                                  dicarbonyl(olefin)cyclobutadieneiron, (tertiary-                                phosphine)(olefin)cyclopentadienylcobalt and                                    bis(olefin)cyclopentadienylrhodium. Compounds employed in the                   second part of the study will be mainly from the platinum group                 of metals.",
