The empirically based study will examine headedness effects in                  two complementary situations:  the learning of English by native                speakers of Persian, and the learning of Persian by native                      English speakers.  The approach will be based on Government-and-                Binding Theory, because it seems the most promising and active                  direction in recent work.  The focus is on the headedness                       parameter, because its value differs in Persian and English,                    because the parameter is itself complex, bearing relation to                    other issues, and because it has received significant attention                 in recent research.                                                                                                                                                  The research problem is an interesting and timely one,                     exploring the implications of a highly topical issue in linguis-                tic theory in the realm of second language acquisition.  The                    theoretical issue is the consistency of \"headedness\" of phrases:                in most languages, if verbs precede their objects, then preposi-                tions will precede their objects, or conversely both will follow.               Some languages are exceptions to this pattern, however, and                     Persian is an especially notable example.  The exceptions raise                 the problem of devising a coherent theoretical account which fits               all cases.  A theory of parametric variation of languages seems                 promising.  The theory has certain theoretical implications for                 second language acquisition by adults across the theoretical                    barrier between the regular and the exceptional languages.  The                 project being planned will test these implications.  The planning               grant will enable fuller development of the theoretical framework               and the hypotheses to be tested, and establishing the logistical                arrangements for the rather complex testing (based in university                classrooms) which will be required.",
