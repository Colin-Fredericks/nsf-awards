 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large body of research suggests that people have a strong                     need to maintain a positive self-image, and that self-esteem                    plays an important role in a diverse array of important human                   behaviors.  Despite this agreement on the importance of self-                   esteeem, the question of why people need self-esteem has not                    been addressed.  This research will attempt to answer three                     questions: (1) why do people need self-esteem?; (2) how is                      self-esteem related to other aspects of people's conceptions of                 reality?; and (3) how does the need for self-esteem affect                      social behavior.  This research will explore to what extent                     self-esteem functions to buffer the anxiety that results from                   human awareness of their vulnerability and mortality.  Because                  self-esteem is essentially a cultural creation, a great deal of                 social behavior is oriented toward acquiring validation of                      one's worldview and self-worth from others.  If self-esteem and                 cultural worldviews serve an anxiety-buffering function, then:                  (a) increasing a person's self-esteem or faith in worldview                     should make that person less prone to anxiety in a threatening                  situation, and (b) reminding people of a major source of                        anxiety should increase their need for validation of their                      self-worth and worldview.  This research should increase our                    understanding of why self-esteem is so important and so                         beneficial for the individual.",
