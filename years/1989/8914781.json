 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a collaboration between Northeastern                      University and the University of Lowell and focuses on a Spectra                Physics Ring Dye Laser (actively stabilized model 380D) owned by                Northeastern but currently installed in the research optics                     laboratory at the University of Lowell.  It is pumped by a new                  Lexel 5W Argon ion laser provided by the University of Lowell.                  This tunable laser source provides a key probe in the study of                  the quantum confinement effects for optical beam modulation.  The               objectives of the research are centered around the investigations               of particle distribution, nonlinear refractive indices,                         estimation of response times, and beam amplitude noise.  The                    primary activity will be the study of a specific type of non-                   linear optical medium that can exhibit large optical non-                       linearities with short response times.  A strongly non-linear                   material allows relatively weak optical fields to be used for                   writing structures that can diffract or modulate optical beams.                 The optical device envisioned ultimately will consist of an array               of sets or clusters of 'quantum dots'.  In the initial stages of                this program, materials such as colloidal suspensions of                        (40 Angstrom) gold particles, are readily available and will be                 used to study quantum confinement effects.                                           A data base will be developed on the optical properties of                 this particle suspension as a function of incident power and                    wavelength; response times and the bulk optical nonlinearity of                 the medium as a function of particle concentration, and where                   possible, particle size will be measured.                                            The principal investigators are qualified to conduct this                  research and a grant of $25,000 for one year is recommended.",
