 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many enzymes and structural proteins are multimeric complexes                   made up of a number of identical or different subunits.  For                    those complexes located within sub-cellular organelles, assembly                often does not proceed until the cytoplasmically synthesized                    subunits are translocated into the organelle.  The photosynthetic               oxygen-evolving enzyme complex (OEC) of chloroplasts is one such                complex which is minimally composed of three nuclear-encoded                    polypeptides in association with five chloroplast-encoded                       subunits.  This project focuses on the assembly of the OEC in                   organello by presenting the three nuclear-encoded subunits,                     synthesized in vitro from cloned genes, to isolated intact                      chloroplasts.  The investigation will proceed in two sequential                 phases.  In the first, the experimental conditions allowing the                 efficient association of the three extrinsic subunits with PS II                will be optimized, and the state of the newly assembled OEC will                be evaluated.  Different conditions will be examined for their                  ability to produce newly assembled complexes which most closely                 resemble those formed in vivo.  In the second phase, some of the                mechanistic details concerning OEC assembly will be elucidated,                 such as the presence of pools of unassembled subunits within the                chloroplasts, the requirement for de novo synthesis of                          chloroplast-encoded PS II reaction center proteins, and the                     lifetimes of unassembled subunits in the lumen.  Where possible,                these results will be used to evaluate general models of protein                complex assembly, and the regulation and control thereof.                                                                                                       The living cell contains complex machinery for many of its                      functions.  These complex assemblages are made up of components                 (proteins) which are made in different compartments of the cell.                The process by which these are made, transported and assembled                  serves to control the cell's metabolism.  This project studies a                complex of photosynthesis but the general principles being                      elucidated apply to many cell processes.",
