 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two related empirical studies of the                   behavior of business inventories and their relation to economic                 fluctuations. The first deals with the role of work-in-progress                 inventories in smoothing demand fluctuations.  The production                   smoothing properties of inventories in production-to-order                      industries are tested using U.S. industry data and a                            linear quadratic model.  The project provides estimates of both                 inventory carrying costs, a final good and total production costs               and demand function parameters for durable good manufacturing.                  The second part investigates differences in inventory management                across firms and industries, particularly testing for the                       presence of (S,s) inventory policies in certain industries, such                as retail trade, as opposed to buffer stock models.  The study                  uses a relatively untapped data source: the quarterly small                     business survey from the National Federation of Independent                     Business.  The NFID data allows the project to test several                     simple inventory models in time series and cross section and                    provide information on the aggregate results used in previous                   work.                                                                                                                                                           This project is important because nearly all empirical tests of                 models of inventories have focuses on inventories of finished                   goods at manufacturing firms which produce goods \"to stock\".                    Production-to-stock industries are those whose products are not                 individuals, i.e., they can be produced before orders are                       received and then sold out of inventory.  These industries are                  the least interesting from a business cycle standpoint since                    their demand and employment fluctuations are small.  This project               studies inventories and production of firms which produce \"to                   order\".  These firms generally produce big ticket durable goods,                such as machinery, metals, automobiles and other transportation                 equipment, and they experience large movements in demand and                    employment over the business cycle.  The results of the research                will identify the key elements in allowing firms to adjust to                   demand disturbances or business cycles.",
