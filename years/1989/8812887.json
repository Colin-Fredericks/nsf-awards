 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program continues the same experimental and theoretical research           into nonlinear waves and acousto-optics sponsored under previous NSF            grants.  The ultimate goal of the program remains to devise                     heuristically understandable formalisms of important interaction                phenomena that are commonly described by highly abstract mathematics            (nonlinear waves) or by models that often bear little relation to               physical reality (acousto-optics).  In the case of nonlinear waves,             the emphasis is on the mutual and self interaction of coherent and              incoherent spatial soliton entities such as pulsed and CW beams, and            the description of such interactions in terms of attraction/repulsion,          coupled modes, self focusing, frequency chirping, beam bending etc.             Physical experiments will be performed, provided they are relatively            simple in terms of instrumentation and technology.  Numerical                   simulations will form an increasing important part of the program.              The emphasis on acousto-optics will be on the weak and strong                   interaction of arbitrary sound and light fields in physically                   realistic configurations.  Formalisms will be in terms of mutual                scattering and rescattering of acoustical and optical plane wave                spectra.  Relatively short term device research may be part of both             research areas, either as a convenient route to familiarization or              simply to follow up some promising applications.",
