 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to investigate the roles of two organs, the yolk sac and         the kidney in hormonal regulations of calcium and phosphate in the              chicken embryo.  The kidney functions during embryogenesis but its role         in calcium and phosphate regulation during this time is largely                 unknown.  During the first half of incubation the mesonephros develops;         however during the latter half of incubation both meso-and metanephros          (the definitive adult kidney) are functional.  The mesonephros                  gradually  regresses and ceases functioning about day 18.  Dr. Clark            proposes to measure the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and clearance          of calcium and phosphate in embryos of different ages and in response           to the presence or absence of calcium-regulating hormones \u0131parathyroid          hormone (PTH), calcium (CT) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3!.  The yolk sac         is an embryonic structure that the first provides calcium and phosphate         from the yolk to the embryo; later in development excess calcium                derived from the shell is deposited in the yolk.  Dr. Clark will study          the structure and function of the yolk sac in normal and                        hormone-treated embryos in regard to uptake and transport of 45Ca and           32p, presence of calcium binding protein, and calcium and phosphate             content of the yolk.  This work should provide new basic information            regarding the function of yolk sac and embryonic kidney, and add much           to our understanding of the ontogeny of calcium-regulating hormones and         targets in birds.",
