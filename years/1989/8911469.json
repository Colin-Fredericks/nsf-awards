 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in Science, Technology and Society supports projects that               examine the social, intellectual, economic, and political                       contexts that influence the development and use of science and                  technology.  This project focusses on diffusion of scientific                   knowledge and tests hypotheses concerning center - periphery                    relationships in information exchange.  Four hypotheses will be                 examined in this project: how diffusion is increasingly                         globalized; how position in the global network of national                      scientific communities -- called the scientific world-system, is                defined by the directionality of information exchange; how local                centers exist more in certain disciplines than others; and how                  centrality is affected by research performance and collegial ties               with foreigners.  The international networks of knowledge                       diffusion will be measured by bibliographic citations given each                year (1974-1986) by researchers in each major country to previous               works from each major country (USA, UK, FRG, France, Canada,                    Japan, and USSR) in each discipline (clinical medicine,                         biomedicine, biology, chemistry, physics, earth and space                       science, engineering and technology, and mathematics).  The                     project will yield knowledge about the strengths and limits of                  bibliographic citation analysis in developing an understanding of               the structure and dynamics of creation and diffusion of knowledge               among scientists and in nation-states.  It will produce                         publications contributing to knowledge about the scientific                     world-system and reports serving domestic and foreign science                   policy.                                                                                                                                                         This study comes from well-qualified researchers.  Research and                 dissemination plans are appropriate; institutional support is                   very good; the budget is modest.  The project has important                     implications for our understanding of intellectual and social                   factors that influence development and diffusion of scientific                  knowledge.  Support is recommended.",
