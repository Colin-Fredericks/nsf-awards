 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although economists have made great strides in analyzing the                    nature of the regulatory problem in a variety of industries,                    comparatively little attention has been devoted to the detailed,                all-encompassing and arcane set of regulations that determines                  the prices that defense contractors will receive for their                      products.  These regulations are often referred to as Department                of Defense (DoD) \"profit policy.\"  The major goal of this project               is to explore what new light can be shed on defense procurement                 by recent advances in the economic theory of regulation and                     incentives and by modern financial and accounting theory.  A                    major reason economists have been slow to explore defense                       procurement procedures is that accurate and detailed information                on the procurement procedures that the DoD actually uses is very                inaccessible to the economics profession.  Thus, a second goal of               the project is to produce a complete and detailed description of                the institutions in a form which is understandable and accessible               to the economics community.  Specific topics investigated include               the cost allocation process, incentives for cost-minimization,                  incentives for innovation, and the impact of the budgeting                      process on the military services' incentives to negotiate prices.                                                                                               The results of this project will provide useful insights into the               billion dollar a year defense procurement industry.   Many of                   the issues studied in the context of defense procurement also                   arise in some form in other regulated sectors.  Therefore, the                  analysis of this project should contribute to the general theory                of regulation.  Finally, the project will provide an invaluable                 source of information on the institutional aspects of defense                   procurement for other economists to use.",
