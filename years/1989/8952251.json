 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enhances the quality of undergraduate teaching in                  Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) by                      increasing the number of computer workstations.  There were                     several deficiencies in teaching these courses with a single                    workstation connected to various expensive peripherals.  The                    department could not use the university's IBM or VAX mainframes                 because of the specialized configuration and display needs                      associated with image processing and geographic information                     systems.                                                                                                                                                        The major equipment acquired in this project is connected to the                existing computer and peripherals, through a Local Area Network,                (LAN).  The LAN accomodates more students and permits more                      complicated image processing and GIS analyses procedures than                   waiting in line to access the one and only workstation.  This                   project is significant since it provides an opportunity for                     students from various fields to learn state-of-the-art applied                  technologies.  The institution is matching the NSF grant with an                equal amount of funds.",
