 "awd_abstract_narration": "Control system synthesis involves the interplay between the                     creation and assessment of alternative control structures and                   controller designs.  It consists of two tasks:  control                         structure selection and controller design.  Control structure                   selection entails the selection of measurements, manipulated                    variables and their feedback interconnections.  Specifications                  of measured outputs and manipulated inputs is usually                           determined from the control objectives which include economic                   factors, operational constraints, safety and other practical                    considerations.  Once this is accomplished, the designer must                   then decide how the selected measurements and manipulated                       variables will be interconnected to effect feedback control                     and satisfy the given design requirements.  In a fully                          centralized control system, all of the manipulated variables                    receive feedback information from all of the measured outputs.                  For large scale systems such as chemical plants, power                          systems, etc., some form of decentralization is necessary                       otherwise the control system becomes too costly and                             cumbersome.  The underlying principle in decentralization is                    the decomposition of the system into subsystems followed by                     their independent control.  The design of a decentralized                       control scheme involves the search for a structure which                        minimizes the interactions between variables but which also                     best approximates that attainable with a fully centralized                      system.                                                                                                                                                         In this Industry University Cooperative Research project the                    focus will be on the design of decentralized control systems                    as applied to the chemical process industry.  The research                      will seek to develop interaction measures appropriate for                       consistent, comprehensive analysis of generic control                           structures.  The relationships between such measures and                        important close-loop  properties will be explored.  A                           synthesis procedure based on these relationships will be                        constructed to allow analysis of large industrial control                       systems and lead the designer to the preferred structure.  An                   interactive CAD software will be developed to implement the                     synthesis.  The methodology will be tested on industrial                        examples which will be provided by Tennessee Eastman Kodak and                  General Companies both of which are the industrial                              collaborators for this research program.  Design of                             decentralized control laws will be addressed.  This will                        include developing design tools that permit assessment of                       important feedback properties and may consequently be used for                  final screening of control structures.",
