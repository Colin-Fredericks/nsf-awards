Access to instrumentation capable of                 carrying out these state-of-the-art techniques is essential for                 the prosecution of frontier research in several fields of                       chemistry.                                                                                                                                                      The Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida will                   use this award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to                     help acquire a mass spectrometer.  The areas of chemical                        research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include the                   following:                                                                                                                                                      1) Carbene complexes from rearrangement of transition metal                        sigma complexes and strained allenes: free and complexed to                     transition metals                                                            2) Kinetic and stereochemical effects of fluorine substituents                     in thermal homolytic and pericyclic reactions                                3) Heterocyclic cations, benzotriazole chemistry, thermolysis                      of organics, and polyvalent iodine derivatives                               4) Synthetic studies of the ene reaction and samarium diiodide                     mediated reactions                                                           5) Electrochemistry and mass spectrometry in the study of                          metabolic redox reactions mechanisms                                         6) Gas-phase reactions of metal complexes and monoclonal                           antibodies elicited against metal complexes.",
