The central questions for this study are:                         1) what factors lie behind the near unanimous support of the                    Democratic party by Blacks;                                                     2) what was the impact of Jackson's candidacy on Black party                    support across the 1984 and 1988 elections;                                     3) how did Jackson's candidacy affect Black voter turnout in 1984               and 1988;                                                                       4) what factors contributed to the discrepant turnout levels in the             1984 and                                                                        1988 presidential elections;                                                    5) and what are the implications of Jackson's candidacy for 1992                and beyond?                                                                                                                                                  The proposed research will utilize data from the 1984 and 1988                  National Black Election Study (NBES).  The NBES data sets, combined,            constitute a four-wave longitudinal study of African-Americans'                 political attitudes and behavior.  The principal investigator will use          the planning period to write a larger, more detailed proposal that              will focus on the validation of the NBES data.  She will also do some           exploratory data analysis to determine the cost of validating the NBES          data.",
