 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ASME's Bioprocess Engineering Program is presenting two                     advanced courses concerning the manufacture of                                  biopharmaceuticals:                                                                       Process Equipment Technology                                                    Process Equipment Design                                              at the University of Virginia during the week of 25 September                   1989.  The audience will be process-development,                                manufacturing-facility, and equipment engineers.  Fifty                         students are expected for each 3 day course.                                                                                                                    Most of the US biotechnology industry is employing labor                        intensive and costly manufacturing methods.  The objective of                   the ASME's bioprocessing program is to help the industry                        develop continuous, instrumented and automated production                       methods which can make its therapeutic and veterinary proteins                  competitive in world markets.  There now is a severe shortage                   of properly trained engineers for commercial-production scale-                  up.                                                                                                                                                             The scholarships requested here are for ME faculty to attend                    the ASME courses for indoctrination in bioprocessing equipment                  technology and design.  They will thus be better prepared to                    initiate curricula at their institutions to produce qualified                   equipment engineers for the US biotechnology industry.",
