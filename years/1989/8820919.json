 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to obtain a long-term (160K                    yrs.) record of the atmospheric deposition of marine derived                    sulfur to the East Antarctic ice sheet.  Measurements of                        methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and non-seasalt sulfate will be made                 on samples on  Vostok and several other Antarctic ice cores.  The               data will allow an assessment of the levels and variability of                  the organosulfur signal under a variety of climatic conditions                  ranging from the relatively stable interglacial or glacial                      maximum to the glacial/interglacial transitional periods.                            The MSA data will provide a basis for differentiating                      between sulfate of biogenic origin, which was originally present                in the atmosphere as fine particle size marine aerosols, and                    sulfate aerosols derived from abiotic sources.  This information                has a direct bearing on our interpretation of the ice-core record               in terms of the abundance of cloud condensation nuclei in the                   paleoatmosphere.  The flux of dimethylsulfide, and hence MSA,                   through the marine atmosphere is also directly related to the                   primary productivity of the oceans, a critical factor in the                    long-term control of atmospheric PC02.  Thus, the global                        distribution of MSA in ice cores can potentially contribute to                  the testing of various scenarios of climate change driven by                    changes in oceanic productivity.  Because the MSA concentration                 is a regional tracer, data from a number of sites are needed.                   Vostok core represents an important element in a larger data set                needed to reconstruct the paleoatmospheric signal of marine                     sulfur emissions.",
