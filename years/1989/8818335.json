 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-part study of tropical plant species related to                      potatoes, emphasizing questions of phylogenetic relationship and                processes of evolutionary change, will be conducted by Drs. Greg                Anderson and Robert Jansen of the University of Connecticut.                    They will generate a large data set of characters pertaining to                 chloroplast DNA and nuclear ribosomal DNA.  These and other data                will be used to construct a tree or cladogram of putative                       genealogical relationships of Solanum section Basarthrum species.               A second series of studies will provide data bearing on                         hypothesized mechanisms of evolutionary change, data from                       morphology, breeding systems, geographical distribution, and                    chromosome composition.  These process-oriented studies should                  help in understanding how the phylogenetic patterns were created.                    The studies focus upon a group of approximately 25 species                 that are native to the high mountains of Latin America and are                  closely related to potatoes.  The group also includes the \"pepino               dulce,\" an Andean species domesticated for its fruit.  Taxonomic                relationships of the pepino are unclear and its origin unknown;                 thus, the study will benefit crop improvement by locating sources               of useful traits that can be incorporated into the cultivated                   varieties.  In addition the study will help explain the origins                 of dioecious solanums, species with separate male (pollen) and                  female (ovule) plants, an otherwise unusual breeding system in                  the genus.",
