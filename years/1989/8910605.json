The pilot project will study the                         relationship between, on the one hand, major conformational                     shifts in oxidase protein the P.I. has previously observed using                                                                                                rabbit subunit-specific IgG, and on the other hand, \"open\" and                  \"closed\" states of the oxidase reported by others to influence                  the accessibility of the enzyme's oxygen binding site to ligands                                                                                                such as cyanide.  Two directions of influence will be examined:                                                                                                 The effect of antibody binding in the kinetics of cyanide-                      inhibition of the oxidase, and the effect of bound cyanide on the                                                                                               affinity of the antibodies for the oxidase.  In addition to                     establishing the effectiveness of polyclonal IgG as a research                  tool to explore the functional role of oxidase protein, it is                                                                                                   anticipated that the planning activities will enable the                                                                                                        initiation of the Principal Investigator's independent research                                                                                                 career by establishment of a research laboratory and independent                                                                                                publication.
