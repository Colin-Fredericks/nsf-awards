 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists are being challenged to use their accumulated                   data and insights to solve large-scale problems of resource                     management and to predict effects of stresses on ecosystems.  To                meet these challenges we must incorporate knowledge from a wide                 variety of ecosystems into syntheses that will produce general                  principles and models.  These efforts in comparative ecology will               require cooperation among ecologists with a range of perspectives               including those specializing in physiological, population,                      community and ecosystem ecology.  Another problem is to develop                 ways by which ecological data collected at the scale of a square                meter or a hectare can be scaled up to describe ecological                      phenomena for larger areas - landscapes, regions and ultimately                 the globe.  A workshop is proposed that will collect the thought                of the scientific community on how to: 1) foster synthesis based                on comparative ecology; and 2) address issues of scale.  One idea               to be considered is a national center for the study of                          comparative ecology and scale.  Ecologists representing                         population, community and ecosystem ecology will attend the                     meeting and attempt to reach a consensus about the proposed                     topic.  A series of position paper will be presented and a                      consensus document will represent the views of the ecological                   research community.  The organizer of workshop are well qualified               to run the meeting and write a summary document from the                        meeting.",
