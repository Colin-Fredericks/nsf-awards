 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines the physical and cellular biochemistry of                a novel exchange protein found in the gram-negative anaerobe                    Oxalobacter formigenes.  In this anaerobe, the exchange of                      divalent oxalate for monovalent formate forms the basis for                     generation of proton-motive force.  This antiport reaction is                   unprecedented among \"chemiosmotic\" carriers for its role in                     cellular biochemistry and unique among anion exchange proteins                  for its electrogenic character.  Assays have been devised to                    reconstitute this antiport reaction without loss of function and                are used as a guide to purify the exchange protein from membranes               of O. formigenes.  After the protein is purified experiments will               reveal the kinetic reaction mechanism (Ping Pong or Simultaneous)               and that portion of the reaction cycle which carries charge over                the membrane.  Using residue-specific chemical probes, monoclonal               antibodies directed against the antiport protein, and the derived               amino acid sequence predictions will be made about the physical                 structure.                                                                                                                                                      Oxalobacter formigenes, a gram-negative anaerobe, is a cell whose               sole source of metabolic energy derives from the decarboxylation                of oxalic acid.  It has been established that membranes of O.                   formigenes contain a carrier that displays the electrogenic                     exchange of divalent oxalate and monovalent formate.  This                      reaction is of particular interest to cellular biochemistry as a                mechanism whereby the organism sustains a proton-motive force.                  Thus, the antiport of precursor and product results in the net                  entry of negative charge, while consumption of a proton during                  oxalate decarboxylation changes internal pH.  This is a novel use               for such a \"secondary\" carrier and is of interest to determine                  whether other cells that utilize carboxylic acids also exploit                  such antiport reactions.  This research will examine the                        molecular properties of this carrier and its overall function in                cellular biochemistry.  This work will contribute to the current                understanding of how bacteria organize their cellular functions.",
