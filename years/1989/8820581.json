 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this research project is to elucidate                  the chemical structure and the mode of action of endogenous                     ligands for benzodiazepine (BZ)/GABA receptors with a special                   focus on their role in the regulation of GABAergic transmission.                More specifically, the plan is to perform the following studies:                                                                                                1.  Endogenous ligands for benzodiazepine receptor(s) (BZR) will                be purified so that sufficient quantity of the purified                         endogenous ligands can be obtained for functional analysis and                  structural determination.                                                                                                                                       2.  Ligand binding studies and behavioral tests will be conducted               to determine the specificity and the mode of action of endogenous               ligands, e.g. agonist, antagonist, of inverse agonist of the                    central type BZR.  In addition, the effect of endogenous ligands                on the GABA binding site, barbiturates binding site, and the Cl..               ion channel will also be investigated.                                                                                                                          3.  Purified endogenous ligands as haptens will be used and                     conjugated to a carrier protein (e.g. bovine serum albumin or                   hemocyanin) to serve as antigen for the production of polyclonal                and monoclonal antibodies.                                                                                                                                      These studies are important for understanding the ligand binding                characteristics and competition for receptor sites on nerve cell                membranes.",
