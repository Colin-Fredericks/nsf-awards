 "awd_abstract_narration": "A model for the large deformation processing of thermoplastics             in the solid phase will be developed based on a viscoplastic finite             element formulation in order to take advantage of the inherent rate-            dependent behavior of solid thermoplastics during forming.  An                  implicit time integration scheme will be used to account for elastic            effects during forming.  Special attention will be paid to the form             and origin of the material descriptions.  Models motivated by                   microstructural considerations will be given preference with some               developmental effort expected in that area.  Application of the                 forming model will be made to thermoplastic forming processes for               which experimental data is available in the literature.                         Consideration will be given to transient problems, such as sheet                forming, and to processes which may be modeled as steady-state, such            as extrusion and cold-drawing.  The ultimate product of the research            should be a predictive model with application to the design and                 development of processes for the manufacturing of thermoplastics.",
