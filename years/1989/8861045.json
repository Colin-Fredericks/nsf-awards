 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both the miniaturization and the increase of power of UV light                  sources are currently seriously limited by the capability of                    cooling such devices.  Such light sources are presently used in                 drying industrial inks, coatings and adhesives on papers, metals,               glasses and other substrates.  Furthermore, similar equipment is                employed in the manufacture of semiconductor devices.  Higher                   power sources will allow for greater collimation of the light                   output, which would be highly advantageous for optical                          lithography.                                                                                                                                                    In Phase I of this SBIR Award, the basic nature of the physical                 mechanisms involved in the jet cooling of spheres will be                       examined, with a view to obtaining improved cooling capability of               spherical light sources.  Experiments are to be conducted to                    evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as acoustic                       excitation, pulsing of the jet lips, pulsing of the oncoming                    flow, and shaping of the jet nozzle.  These techniques are                      expected to markedly increase the entrainment rate and, thereby,                the degree of mixing--with a consequent net increase of the heat                transfer capability of the jet cooling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ____________________________                    ____________                    Program Director's Signature                    Date//",
