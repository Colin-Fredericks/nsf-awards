 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding for the design and development of           a daylighting and lighting simulation facility being constructed at             the University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Urban                  Planning.  The facility includes various research and design tools,             including a 30-foot diameter hemispherical sky simulator for                    daylighting studies; a full scale photometric simulation laboratory;            an integrating sphere for window and shading systems studies.  The              facility also provides state-of-the art computer simulation modeling            in daylighting, lighting, and energy.  The objectives are to provide            a facility in which various architectural spaces can be modeled and             tested, and will be available to research, teaching, and design                 faculties, as well as professionals in design communities.  Due to              the high cost of energy, the contributions of this type of facility             have been recognized by the research, education, and design                     communities throughout the country.  The University of Michigan is a            member of Daylighting Network of North America and has regional                 research center designation.  This new facility is designed in such a           way as to be used as a prototype for fabrication by other interested            educational and research institutions.",
