 "awd_abstract_narration": "Government restrictions on the production and dissemination of                  certain kinds of scientific and technical knowledge have become                 increasingly common and controversial.  Weapons related research                has long been kept strictly classified.  In recent years,                       however, even cryptographic research funded by non-defense                      agencies like the NSF have had publication restrictions placed on               them.  Within the past year, a US government supported conference               on new developments in superconductivity was closed to non-US                   participants or observers.  As often happens in the history of                  science, however, these seemingly new restrictions on research by               the state have had a very long history.  Indeed, in the                         Renaissance, Venice tried to restrict information about the new                 science projectile motion being carried out by Niccolo Tartaglia.                                                                                               Dr. Stroup, under this research grant, will be examining the                    relationship between scientists and the French state just as                    both modern science and the modern centralized state were                       developing.  As Dr. Stroup notes, the Scientific Revolution                     brought with it not only new science but a new ideology about the               world and humans place in it.  This ideology was a kind of creed                for scientists who articulated ideas of progress, advocated                     collective research, claimed that knowledge transcended                         geopolitical borders, and sought practical benefits for                         humankind.  As a theory of knowledge and its social functions,                  this ideology affirmed the power of reason, had its roots in                    civic humanism and utopian ideas and linked science and society.                This same ideology informs, to a greater or lesser degree,                      science as it is practiced today.                                                                                                                               Even in this early period in the history of modern science,                     alliances between the scientists and the state sometimes made                   this ideology a fiction.  In France, for example, Louis XIV                     founded and funded an Academie Royale des Sciences and a                        Compagnie des Arts et Metiers, whose members and activities                     embody the conflict between this new ideology and political                     constraints.                                                                                                                                                    Dr. Stroup is examining the scientific ideology as articulated by               late 17th century French scientists and is comparing it with the                ideologies advanced by contemporary political philosophies.                     This comparison reveals how science and ideology were used by                   scientists and the state.  She will look at this interplay in the               context of four central issues:  the clash between scientific and               political ideologies; the role of technology in political theory                and practice; scientists as secret agents; and science, politics                and religion.  She will carry out this research at archives in                  Paris.",
