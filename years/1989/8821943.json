 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project applies insights from the theory of growth that have               developed over the last five years.  The fundamental challenge                  taken up by this theory is to understand the role and                           determinants of technological change.  Four suggestions for                     applying and developing the theory are proposed.  The first                     considers the relative importance of physical capital                           accumulation and the training of scientific and engineering                     talent in determining the rate of growth.  The second considers                 the issues raised by international trade in a model of growth,                  with emphasis on possible \"brain drain\" type flows of skilled                   individuals from less advanced to more advanced countries.  The                 third considers the issue of whether the different growth                       experiences of different countries are determined largely by                    policy decisions or instead have a large element of chance.  The                fourth considers the unique role that military research may play                in influencing the rate and direction of technological change,                  especially in the United States.                                                                                                                                It has been argued that the earlier (1950's-style) growth theory                died when it failed to link up with empirically-oriented                        macroeconomists.  The recent theoretical work may be saved a                    similar fate if the empirical study undertaken by this project                  enables the scientific investigation of fundamental policy                      questions about growth.",
