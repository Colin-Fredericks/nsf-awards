 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Danny D. Edie,                       Co-Director, Advanced Engineering Fibers Laboratory, Clemson                    University, to pursue with Dr. Bosung Rhee, Professor of Chemical               Engineering, Chungnam National University, Taejon, Korea, and Dr.               Erich Fitzer, Director, Institute for Chemical Technology,                      Universitat Karlsruhe, Federal Republic of Germany, for a period of             24 months, a program of cooperative research on hollow and c-shape              carbon fiber from pitch and its applicability to carbon fiber                   reinforced composite (CFRC) materials.  In this research, a                     commercial mesophase precursor will be extruded into non-circular               fibers which have a higher strength and strain-to-failure ratio                 than present round commercial carbon fibers.  Initial studies show              that the properties of these non-circular fibers depend on the                  fiber shape, the extrusion velocity, the fiber size, and the                    composition of the mesophase.  In this research project, mesophase              precursors will be produced at Chungnam National University and                 Universitat Karlsruhe.  The chemical nature and the molecular                   weight distribution of the mesophase materials will be analyzed at              Clemson University as well as by the Korean and German research                 groups.  Equipment available at the Korea Research Institute for                Chemical Technology, near Chungnam University, will be used to                  measure the functional groups and aromatic character of the                     mesophase samples, while rheology analyses will be carried out at               Clemson University.                                                                                                                                             Composite structures of carbon fibers and plastic are being                     increasingly utilized in aircraft and automotive applications                   because their strength-to-weight ratio is greater than the best                 metal alloys available.  Many aircraft wing structures are                      currently fabricated with carbon/epoxy composite material, while                automobile manufacturers are presently testing composites of carbon             fibers and plastics for use in leaf and coil springs, drive shafts,             body frames and body side panels.  Successful completion of this                project could offer industry superior reinforcing fibers                        manufactured from a low cost raw material.  This is a unique                    project which will bring the research strengths/expertise of U.S.,              Korean, and German institutions/scientists to bear on a problem of              mutual interest and potential benefit.  The PI's are highly                     respected scientists who have collaborated successfully in the                  past.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                        U.S.-Republic of Korea and U.S.-Federal Republic of Germany                     Cooperative Science Programs which seek to increase the level of                cooperation between scientists and engineers of these countries                 through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and              techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefit.  This project will add an international cooperative                    dimension to Dr. Edie's research under NSF Grant No. ENG-8710385.",
