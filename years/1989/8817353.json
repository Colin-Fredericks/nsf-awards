 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kohistan exotic terrane of N. Pakistan was accreted to Asia                 in the Mid-Cretaceous and turned \"edge-up\" to expose in plan view               an essentially complete vertical section through the crust and                  upper mantle of an intra-oceanic island arc complex.  Beneath the               volcanic and calc-alkaline batholith sequence is an immense lower               crustal mafic-ultramafic-layered cumulate complex that provides a               record of the differentiation processes by which \"primary\"                      basaltics melts from the mantle evolved in the lower crust to                   yield the high-alumina basalts and basaltic andesites that                      dominate the eruptive sequence.  The plutonic layered cumulates                 provide important evidence regarding the petrogenesis of the                    calc-alkaline magma series that is quite unlike evidence deduced                from the study of phenocryst assemblages in lavas.  The cumulate                complex is one of the world's largest exposures of layered mafic-               ultramafic rocks and is potentially a major storehouse of mineral               wealth.  By means of integrated field studies and whole-rock and                mineral geochemical studies in a series of traverses across the                 cumulate series, this cooperative study involving geoscientists                 from Azad Jammu and Kashmir University and Purdue University is                 expected to clarify important petrogenetic questions and to                     screen the cumulate sequence for stratigraphic intervals most                   promising as hosts to platinum, nickel, copper, chromium, and                   vanadium ore deposits, employing innovative ore-petrogenetic                    concepts and lithogeochemical exploration techniques.",
