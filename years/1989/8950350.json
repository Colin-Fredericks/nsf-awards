 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project will provide updating for high school teachers          on recent content and laboratory developments in chemistry, physics,            biology and mathematics through establishment of a partnership which            will bring high school teachers, college faculty, and industry                  scientists, engineers, and mathematicians into a strong working                 relationship.  The mechanism for providing the update is through                intensive two-day workshops in each discipline area with follow-up              activities between Inver Hills faculty, industry scientists and high            school teachers to insure effective application in the high school              classroom and to offer specialized classes at the college.  Updates will        be planned, presented, and evaluated by the partnership of technical            industry, a regional planning and service agency, a community college,          and local school districts.  Commitments have been received to foster           dissemination and application of this model partnership in community            colleges throughout Minnesota and at the national level.                                                                                                        Cost sharing by the partners will total 64% of the National Science             Foundation funding.",
