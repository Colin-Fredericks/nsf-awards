 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent progress in the study of how we perceive black, gray, and                white surfaces has been based heavily on the insight that the                   retinal image is encoded in terms of relative, rather than                      absolute, light intensities, or luminances.  This research will                 investigate two serious problems for models based on relative                   luminance, known as ratio models.  In one study, reports by                     observers in a completely homogeneous visual field that grows                   either brighter or darker for an extended period of time, at a                  rate too slow for detecting the change, will indicate whether the               visual system senses absolute luminance in the absence of visible               spatial and temporal change.  The homogeneous visual field will                 eliminate spatial changes in luminance and the gradual change of                luminance over time will eliminate the detection of temporal                    change.  The hypothesis that only relative luminances are encoded               suggests the counter-intuitive result that under these conditions               the human observers will not be able to discriminate a very                     bright field from a very dark field.  Deduction of visual                       processes underlying surface color perception requires a                        specification of whether relative or absolute luminances, or                    both, are available to the visual system.  In the second study,                 observers will view various displays through a glass panel that                 reflects a homogeneous sheet of light, known as a veiling                       luminance; their experience will be much like looking through a                 fog.  Although contrasts, or relative luminances, are                           dramatically reduced under these conditions, observers are able                 to identify gray shades correctly if the display behind the veil                is sufficiently complex.  Systematic variation of the display                   will enable the determination of factors that allow correct                     identification.  These results should carry strong implications                 regarding how relative luminances are processed so as to produce                visual experience of white and black surfaces.",
