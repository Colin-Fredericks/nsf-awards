 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central question in economics is how markets coordinate the                   behavior of anonymous decision makers in a many person                          decentralized economy.  A successful answer to this question                    requires understanding how anonymous decision makers behave in                  environments that exhibit strategic independence.  In most                      economic environments, it is not possible to prescribe, describe,               or predict a decision maker's behavior or the market outcome                    without a theory of interdependent decisions.  Unfortunately,                   existing theories of interdependent decisions predict multiple                  equilibria.                                                                                                                                                     The purpose of this project is to build a general theory of                     interdependent decisions based on carefully designed                            experiments.  This theory is based on the concept of equilibrium                refinements.  Equilibrium refinements determine when an outcome                 that is already expected would be implemented by rational                       players.  The project develops a theory of interdependent                       decisions that not only identifies the outcomes that are self-                  enforcing when expected but also identifies the expected                        outcomes.                                                                                                                                                       More specifically, the investigators define a class of repeated                 market games which generalizes the coordination games used in                   their previous research by formalizing the concept of an                        anonymous decision maker.  These markets games capture the                      essential aspects of the equilibrium selection problem on a                     decentralized economy.  A laboratory environment is used to study               the market games and to test a theory of repeated market games.                 The project formalizes the intuition that asset markets                         coordinate behavior by defining a set of admissible equilibria                  based on pre-play behavior by the participants, develops a theory               of game form auctions, and considers whether the Folk theorem                   generalizes to repeated market games.  The theory of repeated                   games is tested in the laboratory.  The experiments consider                    alternative indexes of market activity, first best disequilibrium               outcomes, alternative market institutions, incomplete                           information, and aggregate demand management by a large decision                maker.                                                                                                                                                          This project is important because it provides extends theory and                provides new empirical evidence on the way decisions are                        coordinated in decentralized economies.  The results of the                     research will permit economists to make more precise, testable                  predictions about actual economies with interdependent decision                 making.",
