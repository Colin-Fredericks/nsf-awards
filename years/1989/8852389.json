 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to integrate in a significant way the                design and research component of engineering into the                           undergraduate education of students.  Without sacrificing any of                the present programs which have served so well in the past, it is               desired to improve our students' practical experiences and                      engineering insight by providing interaction with state-of-the-art              design methodology and tools.  A design laboratory with facilities              for computer-sided design, simulation, prototype construction and               testing of electronic systems is being established.  Students                   presently employ personal computers and instrumentation for                     data acquisition, control, analysis, design and display in a                    junior- level laboratory.  Our senior-level design and research                 courses offer some capability for computer-aided design and                     simulation, but nothing for construction and testing of the                     resulting design.  The new senior-level design laboratory would                 provide facilities for student design teams to carry out a term                 project from conception through construction and verification.                  The goal of this laboratory is to provide an engineering                        environment in which seniors can fully exercise their creative                  abilities and engineering background in the development of a                    physical electronic system.",
