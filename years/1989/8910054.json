 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to support a conference which focuses on an                 interdisciplinary approach to the study of movement.  The                       engineering Foundation originated this conference which brings                  together some of the top scientists in the country to discuss                   current issues in biomechanics and physiological motor systems.                                                                                                      Motor control is in one sense, a mechanical problem of                     moving masses such as bodies and limbs through space to                         accomplish tasks necessary for the welfare and survival of an                   animal. Such problems are nominally the domain of the engineer.                 It is also a problem of biology in that mechanical tasks are                    performed by biological systems which are evolved over time.                    These systems are the interest of the physiologists.  Therefore,                this conference provides a forum for physiologists and engineers                to openly discuss research objectives for the field which are of                common interest to both groups.                                                                                                                                       A large number of students will be present to take                        advantage of the conference proceedings and to gain insight from                individuals who are already active in the field.",
