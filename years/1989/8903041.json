 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kupiainen's research project in statistical                      mechanics has two parts, one in the physics of disordered systems               and the other in the application of conformal field theory to                   two-dimensional critical phenomena. In connection with disordered               systems, he will endeavor to develop exact renormalization group                methods for the study of random walks in random environments, of                interface fluctuations in the presence of random fields or random               exchange couplings, and of spin glass models. On the conformal                  field theory side, he will continue investigations in which the                 Wess-Zumino-Witten model is used to solve various conformal                     theories.                                                                            Statistical mechanics studies the behavior of systems                      consisting of very large numbers of particles interacting with                  one another. Typically, the particles would be arrayed in a                     lattice and interactions would take place between nearest                       neighbors. The basic problem is predict the overall, long-run                   behavior (equilibria, phase transitions, and the like) of the                   system given information about the interactions. Mathematically,                this is a very difficult undertaking even in the simplest models.               A further complication occurs when elements of randomness are                   present, as in the research to be undertaken by Professor                       Kupiainen.",
