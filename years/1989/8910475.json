Boyd,                      Department of Fisheries and Allied Aquacultures, Auburn,                        University, to pursue with Dr. Yont Musig, Department of                        Aquaculture, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand, for a                     period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research on                       sediment trapping by brackish water aquaculture ponds in the                    vicinity of Bangkok, Thailand.  Objectives of the research are                  (1) to evaluate the sediment trapping ability of these ponds                    and (2) to determine the chemical and textural composition of                   the sediment as well as its oxygen consumption rate.                                                                                                            Four large rivers enter the upper Gulf of Thailand in the                       region around Bangkok.  These rivers drain a large area of                      agricultural land and pass through the heavily populated area                   around Bangkok.  Their waters are laden with suspended soil                     particles, organic matter, and nutrients.  In the estuarine                     reaches of the rivers, a vast network of canals has been                        constructed for transportation, domestic and industrial water,                  irrigation, capture fisheries, and to supply water for brackish                 water aquaculture farms.  These farms are mostly used for                       shrimp production by extensive methods, i.e. without the                        addition of manure, fertilizers, or feed.  Water flushes                        through the ponds at the rate of at least 10% per day.  It is                   in this setting that the PI's will study the sediment trapping                  ability of the ponds and the ecological importance of processes                 occurring therein.  Through an understanding of these                           processes, better water management schemes may be formulated                    for the region.  The PI's have a record of successful                           collaboration in the field of this research.  The present                       project will allow them to combine their talents and interests                  for mutual benefit.  This project is relevant to the objectives                 of the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to                   increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and                   engineers and their counterparts in developing countries                        through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills,                  and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                  benefit.",
