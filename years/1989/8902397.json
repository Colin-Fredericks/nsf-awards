 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Clancey will investigate problems in operator                    theory and function theory related to representations of the                    algebra of rational functions on finitely connected planar                      domains. Part of this research involves determining the explicit                connections between various finite-dimensional operator algebra                 models for such representations. Function theory on the model                   spaces will also be studied. In particular, explicit descriptions               involving Riemann theta functions will be sought for the                        reproducing kernels associated with the model spaces.                           Applications of this information to the the study of Toeplitz                   operators on the Hardy spaces of multiply connected domains will                be pursued.                                                                          The research envisioned here is about analytic functions, a                central preoccupation of mathematics for well over a century.                   These are functions of a complex (as opposed to real) variable,                 so they live in the plane rather than on the line. They can be                  defined variously as solutions of a certain simple system of                    partial differential equations, as maps which take planar regions               to other planar regions in a way that preserves angles except at                isolated singularities, or (locally) as limits of polynomials in                a suitably precise sense. Analytic functions have the following                 remarkable property: given an arc in a connected open set on                    which the function is defined, the values of the function                       everywhere in that set are completely determined by the values                  just on the arc. Professor Clancey's project is to track down as                explicitly as possible some particular consequences and                         ramifications of this intriguing state of affairs.",
