 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to isolate and characterize                   the receptor for a biologically active hepta-B-glucoside.  A                    radiolabeled hepta-B-glucoside elicitor, for use in ligand-                     binding studies, will be prepared by conjugation of the                         oligosaccharide to tyramine, followed by iodination of the                      conjugate.  It has been established that a model                                heptaglucoside, maltoheptaose, can be conjugated to tyramine                    and furthermore, that the structural modifications of the                       hepta-B-glucoside elicitor required for radiolabeling with                      iodine are unlikely to affect its elicitor activity.  A                         photoaffinity labeling reagent for receptor localization and                    identification studies will also be prepared.  The                              receptor(s) for the hepta-B-glucoside elicitor will be                          identified and localized using standard cell fractionation                      techniques, ligand-binding assays, and photo-affinity                           labeling.  If an elicitor receptor is identified, it will be                    purified and characterized.  The proposed experiments will                      lay the groundwork for future studies to determine the                          physiological significance of the receptor(s) and to identify                   the role the receptor(s) play in the signal pathway that                        results in altered gene expression leading, in turn, to                         phytoalexin accumulation in affected plant cells.%%%                                                                                                            Fungal-derived B-glucans, of the type from which the active                     hepta-B-glucoside was isolated, are active as inducers or                       enhancers of a variety of defense mechanisms in plants.  The                    only biologically active B-glucan-derived fragment that has                     been purified to homogeneity and structurally characterized                     is a hepta-B-glucoside elicitor.  Induction of phytoalexin                      accumulation by the hepta-B-glucoside elicitor is an                            excellent model system for the study of the structure and                       function of oligosaccharide receptors in plants because the                     complete structure of the oligosaccharide ligand has been                       determined and considerable information is known about the                      genes whose transcription is induced in plant cells upon                        binding of the oligosaccharide.  The proposed studies, if                       successful, will be particularly important in plants, since                     plant receptors for regulatory molecules have not yet been                      purified and characterized.***//",
