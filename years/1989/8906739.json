 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosensory and chemosensory motility responses in both                   gliding and swimming bacteria (phototrophic and chemotrophic                    types) are regarded as primitive \"neurosensory\" analogs and are                 presumed to be adaptations that enhance the survival potential of               the organism in nature.  In this proposal, diel vertical                        migration patterns of microorganisms will be examined in a                      variety of microbial mat communities representing highly                        advantageous strategies that optimize both the day and night                    microenvironments.  The objective will be to:  quantify the diel                schedule of movements in hot spring and other mats; to                          experimentally determine the physical and chemical cues to which                organisms respond; and to assess survival rate or comparative                   growth when migration patterns or microenvironments are altered.                The vertical up/down migrations over a 24 hr period occur over                  short distances (a few mm) that represent sharp gradients in                    light intensity, oxygen tension, sulfide concentration, and other               chemical factors.  The results will place tactic behavior in the                context of the natural habitat, previously undetermined in                      ecological studies and will provide data for understanding the                  \"selective forces\" involved in the evolution of oriented motility               in microorganisms.",
