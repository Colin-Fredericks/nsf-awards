 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well known that parallel processing in general, and shared memory         multiprocessing in particular, offers a promising future to achieve             high computational speeds.  A number of researchers have recognized,            however, that as the number of processing elements (PEs) in the                 multiprocessor increase, the communication and synchronization                  overheads required among subtasks of a parallel algorithm can reduce            the speedup, and, consequently, defeat the very purpose of parallel             processing.  They argue that for effective parallel algorithm analysis,         communication and synchronization complexity measures should be used as         performance criteria in addition to the usual parallel time complexity          measure.  As a first step to support this argument, they have developed         communication and synchronization measures for parallel algorithms.  A          parallel algorithm on a shared memory multiprocessor is modeled by a            directed acyclic graph (DAG) with vertices corresponding to computed            values and edges to dependencies.  The DAGs of many practical numerical         algorithms result in regular structures which are suitable to graph-            theoretic and combinatorial analyses.  They have used the communication         measure to prove a trade-off result between computation time and                communication for a triangular solver algorithm.  With this trade-off           result, they can precisely capture the intuitive notion of,                     \"communication increases as the computation time decreases.\"  In the            proposed project, they wish to continue the research in several ways as         detailed in the project description.  They can succinctly state an              important goal: given an algorithm, they should be able to state the            time, communication, and synchronization requirements, and any                  resulting trade-offs as a function of the size of the problem, the              number of PEs, and the architecture.",
