 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unlike most animals which have individuals with separate                   male and female sexes, plants exhibit a great range in breeding                 systems.  Most plant species are hermaphroditic with male and                   female function in the same flower.  But many other species,                    including a number of important crop plants, have separate male                 and female flowers on the same plant or consist of populations of               separate male and female plants (dioecy).  Many hypotheses have                 been proposed to explain the diversity of breeding systems in                   plants and the evolution of dioecy.  One major argument suggests                that dioecy has evolved to avoid inbreeding depression.                         Inbreeding depression occurs when closely-related individuals                   mate (or in the extreme case, self-pollination occurs in                        hermaphrodites) and the resulting offspring show reduced vigor                  and ability to reproduce.                                                            In this research role of inbreeding depression in the                      evolution  of dioecy in the Hawaiian plant genus Schiedea                       (Caryophyllaceae) will be examined.  This group is apparently                   evolving dioecy and exhibits a range of breeding systems in very                closely related species.  This research is of special urgency                   because many of the important intermediate species from the                     fragile Hawaiian ecosystems are near extinction because of                      habitat destruction, grazing by introduced herbivores, and                      competition with introduced plants.  Inbreeding depression is                   also well known to influence yield in many economically important               crop plants, such as corn (Zea mays).  Knowledge of factors                     causing dioecy may lead to greater ability to manipulate sex                    ratios in plants and is of tremendous value where yield depends                 upon the production of fruit or seed by the females as in the                   case of many crop species.",
