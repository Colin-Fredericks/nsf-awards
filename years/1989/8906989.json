 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately one-half of all small streams in North America               contain freshwater red algae and many maintain several species of               Rhodophyta.  These organisms constitute a significant food source               for riverine grazers, and they provide habitat for numerous prey                and predator species.  Despite the importance of freshwater red                 algae in stream ecosystems, few aquatic biologists are able                     readily to identify these organisms.  To rectify this problem,                  Dr. Robert Sheath of the University of Rhode Island is working on               a comprehensive inventory of all genera and species of red algae                of North America, employing morphological and chromosomal data to               construct reliable identification keys, supplemented with                       photographs and illustrations to highlight critical characters.                      In assessing variation among the species, Dr. Sheath employs               computerized image processing to analyze structural features of                 the specimens.  Geographic groupings of species will be related                 to ecological conditions, and trends will be analyzed in relation               to past glacial periods, bedrock, water chemistry, stream flow                  regimes, and flyways of waterfowl (a major mechanism of dispersal               of spores and fragments of red algae).  A comprehensive taxonomic               treatment of all the freshwater red algal species will provide                  the necessary foundation for further evolutionary and ecological                studies.",
