Modified poly(1,6-dimethyl                    phenylene oxide) (PPO) is a promising material for the                          separation of carbon dioxide from hydrocarbons.  More recently                                                                                                  this research group discovered that substitution at the 3 and                   5 positions in the repeat unit of PPO with bromine atoms                        increases the polymer's permeability to carbon dioxide while                    retaining the carbon dioxide/methane permselectivity.  It was                   further found that the diffusivity-related selectivity of the                   modified polymer remains surprisingly high when compared with                   other glassy polymers, in sharp contrast to conventional                        wisdom that lowering interchain packing will bring about a                      loss in size-sieving power of the polymer.  It is proposed                      that the relatively low carbon dioxide/methane permselectivity                                                                                                  of the aryl-brominated PPOs is actually caused by their very                    low solubility-related selectivity.  It is hypothesized that                    introduction of basic groups into the polymer repeat unit will                                                                                                  enhance the solubility of carbon dioxide relative to methane                    in the polymer.  Concurrently, if the packing density and                       torsional mobility of the polymer chain segments are also                       lowered (e.g. by bromine), the resulting polymer will exhibit                   both high carbon dioxide permeability and high permselectivity                                                                                                  for carbon dioxide over methane.  This project consists of a                    systematic experimental investigation of the above hypothesis.                                                                                                  PPO polymers with different degrees of aryl-bromination, aryl-                                                                                                  amination and aryl-phthalimidomethylation will be studied such                                                                                                  that a wide range of packing densities and concentrations of                    basic groups is covered.                                                                                                                                        Membrane gas separation technology will be one of the most                      important developing technologies of the next decade.                           Technological leadership in the area will also translate into                   increased manufacturing efficiency in all of the chemical                       process industry.  This project, if the hypothesis described                    above is demonstrated to be correct, will constitute a major                    advance in membrane science which should translate into                         significant technical advances in membrane separations of gas                   mixtures.",
