 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Jarosz will investigate a number of open problems                concerning maps between various function spaces and algebras that               preserve or only slightly distort metric structure. The common                  thread is to discover algebraic, geometric, lattice, or other                   properties shared by two such spaces when there is an isometry or               small bound isomorphism from one onto the other. These problems                 are closely related to small perturbations of Banach algebras,                  generalizations of the Banach-Stone theorem, geometry of Banach                 spaces, and quasiconformal mappings.                                                 The theory of Banach spaces is about analysis in infinitely                many dimensions. For each finite dimension n, there is only one                 n-dimensional space, in most respects as well understood in                     general as in the familiar cases when n is 1, 2, or 3. These are                used to keep track of situations in which there are only finitely               many degrees of freedom. When the number of degrees of freedom                  becomes infinite, as would for instance be necessary to describe                the configuration of a piece of string, there are many possible                 reasonable choices for the ambient space in which to perform                    analysis. A key element of structure that distinguishes these                   spaces one from another is the way in which distance is measured.               Professor Jarosz's project is concerned with the relationship of                distance measurement to algebraic and geometric properties in                   such spaces, in particular the persistence of these properties                  under small distortions of distance.",
