 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to develop algorithms and software to help                implement the automation of robotic assembly workplace planning.                In electronic manufacturing, many kinds of printed circuit boards               have parts to be inserted by a robot, and the insertions can be                 made in any sequence.  Likewise, one is free to choose locations                of bins or feeders to contain the parts.  The choice of the                     assembly sequence and the location of the bins can greatly affect               the total assemble time, and thus manufacturing productivity.                   The investigators will develop algorithms to determine a best                   assembly sequence, as well as best bin locations, using ideas in                combinatorics and location theory.  Results obtained thus far has               reduced the dimension of the problem by 50% over the best                       available previous approach.  These algorithms will be                          implemented with user-friendly software, operable on a personal                 computer, which will also function in an evaluation mode; the                   user can employ a pointing device in conjunction with computer                  graphics to specify an assembly sequence and location of bins.                  The investigators will examine related problems when set-up times               are dominant, and problems involving the distribution of parts to               bins.  Expected results should be applicable in other                           manufacturing contexts involving robots.",
