 "awd_abstract_narration": "The site of Casas Grandes, located in the Mexican state of                      Chihuahua, lies immediately adjacent to well known archaeological               sites in Arizona and New Mexico.  While prior work at Casas                     Grandes has indicated that this large complex of structures was                 occupied between ca. 1,000 and 1,200 A.D., it remains relatively                unknown in contrast to its northern counterparts.  In particular,               archaeologists understand neither how it relates to numerous                    other ruins in northern Chihuahua nor how this entire complex                   interacted with Chacoan culture in Arizona and New Mexico.  Dr.                 Minnis and his collaborators will attempt to answer these                       questions through a survey of the area which surrounds the Casas                Grandes site.  They will conduct a reconnaissance to locate                     sites, determine the size of each, and collect ceramics from the                ground surface.  These data will allow the relationships with the               Casas Grandes center to be determined and may also permit the                   establishment of a relative chronology.  On this basis it should                then be possible to plan a more detailed survey and excavation.                                                                                                 In the U.S. southwest before the arrival of the Spaniards, large                impressive ruins testify to the rise of an indigenous complex                   society which integrated large numbers of individuals over                      thousands of square miles.  What archaeologists have been unable                to determine is whether this is, in fact, a local development or                whether it developed though contact with similar entities to the                South.  If this latter is the case, then Casas Grandes must have                played a major role.  Unfortunately, very little data is                        available for this site or the surrounding region and Dr. Minnis'               research will help to fill this gap.                                                                                                                            This research is important for several reasons.  Understanding of               southwestern prehistory has been hindered by the fact that the                  Rio Grande, and international boundary, transects this region.                  In comparison to the north, very little is known about                          developments in Mexico and this has hindered our understanding of               cultural development.  This research should help to redress this                imbalance.  It will also shed new light on the development of                   indigenous cultures in the United States.",
