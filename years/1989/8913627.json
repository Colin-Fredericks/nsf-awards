 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant focuses on plasma turbulence in the                             magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, with an emphasis on implications               for space plasmas and S/T research.  A major continuing goal is                 the identification and characterization of basic dynamical                      processes in MHD turbulence.  Prior results on incompressible                   turbulent relaxation processes such as selective decay and                      dynamic alignment will be extended to three dimensions and                      generalized to moderately compressible magnetofluids.  Further                  study and application of turbulent reconnection and turbulence                  driven by large scale velocity shear will be pursued.  These                    turbulence theory studies involve both analytical studies and                   extensive direct numerical simulations.  Study and development of               numerical algorithms for compressible turbulence simulations is                 also undertaken.  A second major area of emphasis is the study of               turbulence in the interplanetary medium at MHD scales, involving                a high degree of interplay with the basic theory and extensive                  comparisons with observational data.  Major undertakings in                     interplanetary studies include further development of the                       consequences of nearly incompressible MHD theory, completion and                numerical implementation of an analytical model for theory,                     completion and numerical implementation of an analytical model                  for the evolution of interplanetary turbulence, including                       couplings of the local turbulence to large scale gradients, and                 the further study of dissipation mechanisms acting near ion                     gyroscales in the solar wind plasma.  A third and closely related               area of study involves the effects of MHD turbulence on charged                 particle acceleration and scattering, especially due to induced                 electric fields.  The overall aim is to understand MHD processes                and hence interplanetary 'weather'.                                              //",
