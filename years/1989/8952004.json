 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enhances the effectiveness of the Electrical and Magnetic          Fields course:  Calculations, Measurements, and Hazard Assessment,              offered at New York Institute of Technology.  This is a popular course          for seniors majoring in electrical engineering at the Metropolitan              Campus of this institution.  This course provides students the                  opportunity to measure and assess the effects of low level non-ionizing         fields in order to evaluate standards for safe levels of exposure.  The         students work independently, investigating current standards,                   identifying health issues, and, most importantly, determining exposure          assessments.  With the instruments acquired under this grant, students          gain a scientific appraisal of actual conditions and do significant             research that contributes to improving this critical database. The              ultimate goal is to prepare engineers to serve as the source of and             interpreters of scientific information that will guide policy-makers            and the general public to make wise decisions on this environmental             issue.                                                                                                                                                          This award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal               investigator's institution.",
