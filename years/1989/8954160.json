 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a cooperative effort between Purdue                       University, the major institution, and the University of Washington             and Stephens Institute of Technology.  It proposes to provide greater           access for women to careers in engineering, while counteracting                 projected shortages of engineering personnel by assisting and                   encouraging engineering schools throughout the United States to                 establish innovative programs for women in engineering or to expand             the scope of existing programs.                                                                                                                                 Specifically, this program would:  (1) organize a national                      conference to study issues and present models of programs for women             in engineering; (2) establish the first national network of Women in            Engineering Program Administrators; (3) provide technical and                   technical programmatic assistance to institutions desiring to                   initiate, replicate, or expand Women in Engineering programs in a               cost-effective manner; (4) establish a central source of research,              information, and resource materials about women in engineering and              related areas; and (5) disseminate information nationally through               conferences and publications.                                                                                                                                   The heart of the proposal begins with items (1) and (2)-the holding             of the national conference and the establishment of the national                network.  In this regard, the three institutions, Purdue, Washington,           and Stephens, will have key administrators participating and                    coordinating - Purdue, the entire program, Washington, the western              region and Stephens, the eastern region.  A time table has been                 developed and the conference will be held in October, two months                after the planning sessions both years.  Subsequently, annual                   conferences and continued upgrading of the directories might be                 possible.                                                                                                                                                       Because of the work of Dr. Daniels at Purdue, the network is fairly             well in hand, and definitive were given for its strengthening,                  collecting and dissemination of information.  The project will                  provide a very meaningful source of information, and to the extent              that the network is successful, it should provide a very useful                 conduit for women to know about, recognize, and enter careers in                engineering.                                                                                                                                                    Financial support will come from eight sources:  the threee                     sponsoring institutions, various engineering organizations, the                 conference participants, industry, the AAAS, and hopefully, the                 National Science Foundation.",
