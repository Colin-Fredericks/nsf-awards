 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide continuing support for a Research                       Experiences for Undergraduates Site in the Department of                        Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University.  The                 past REU program in ecological and evolutionary biology has                     successfully trained undergraduates from Harvard/Radcliffe and 12               other universities during the past two years.  The program is                   designed to provide juniors and seniors contemplating a career in               research with: (1) a realistic orientation to the rewards and                   frustrations experienced in the process of conducting original                  research; (2) instruction in methods for planning, executing,                   interpreting, and presenting research, as well as specialized                   training in a field the student chooses; (3) exposure to and                    active involvement in a rich academic environment, consisting not               only of peers and participating faculty, but also graduate                      students and postdoctoral fellows.  Students receive orientation                and attend weekly meetings together with other REU Site                         participants.  Students are thus encouraged to exchange ideas and               impressions with their peers specializing in other topics.                      Within the field of their choice, students are encouraged to                    become familiar with an assortment of ongoing projects before                   developing and designing their own study.  Throughout each phase,               students work closely with a faculty member who encourages their                scientific maturation.  Students become progressively more                      independent as their work proceeds.  By the conclusion of the                   program, students should be both competent and confident in their               scientific abilities, and should be able to make informed                       decisions concerning the graduate training they wish to pursue.",
