 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is aimed at developing and analyzing algorithms           for supporting high-level parallel programming models.  Graph                   embeddings have been successfully employed to compare different                 parallel architectures and to map parallel computations into parallel           networks.  One component of the project is directed towards developing          new techniques for graph embeddings.  A second component aims to                develop and analyze efficient load-balancing algorithms for  supporting         control-level parallelism at run time.  A third component is directed           toward evaluating the expressive power of different programming models.         The final component is the design of the Fluent machine, a massively            parallel system which supports a very high-level instruction set                efficiently. The research emphasizes algorithms and embedding                   techniques that can be rigorously proved efficient.",
