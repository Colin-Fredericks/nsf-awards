 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Cornell University                 supports a broad range of interactive and interdisciplinary                     materials research in six primary thrust areas.  The ceramics                   program which began in 1986 and developed rapidly over the                      succeeding two years is now focussed on research in silicate                    ceramics with a strong emphasis on synthesis, processing and                    properties of these materials.  The name of the mechanical                      properties thrust has been changed to micromechanics of                         interfaces and composites to reflect its evolution from work on                 the strength and failure modes of metals towards research on                    micromechanical techniques and the properties of polymers and                   composites.  The optical phenomena thrust pursues the development               of pulsed laser spectroscopy and its application to the study of                solids.  The MRL supports the operation of the microkelvin                      laboratory at Cornell; this includes a millikelvin research                     station as well as a microkelvin facility.  The low temperature                 group uses the microkelvin laboratory for research on fundamental               excitations and transport mechanisms in quantum fluids, and on                  collective and single particle electron transport in condensed                  matter.  The novel phases and structures thrust combines                        theoretical and experimental investigations of the microstructure               of liquids and unusual structures and phases in solids.  Finally,               the surfaces and interfaces thrust brings together investigators                with common interests in employing electron microscopy and                      synchrotron radiation to study surface structure and transitions,               surface kinetics, and the structure, properties and control of                  interfaces.                                                                       The MRL also supports the development, operation and                          maintenance of major central materials research facilities and                  provides seed funds for new faculty and high-risk research                      related to its overall program.  The program currently involves                 52 faculty members, 8 postdoctoral research associates, 14 other                technical and scientific professionals, 36 graduate students, and               10 students in \"Research Experience for Undergraduates.\"  The                   Cornell MRL is under the direction of Professor Robert H.
