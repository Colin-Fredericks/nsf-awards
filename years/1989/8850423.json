 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project offers an opportunity to a substantial fraction                    of high school physics teachers (70) in North Carolina to                       participate in a three-year workshop.  This will consist of                     three summer sessions of five weeks each, 18 Saturday                           meetings during the intervening academic years and                              communication to each of the teachers on at least a weekly                      basis via NEWTON, a VAX-based electronic mail abnd database                     system being developed by the University's Academic Computing                   Center and members of the regional high school advisory                         headed by this Project's staff.                                                                                                                                 Conceptual difficulties will be addressed at the beginning of                   each summer session.  The development of problem-solving                        skills will make extensive use of the college version of The                    Mechanical Universe and Beyond as well as the field-tested                      high school version of the same program. Problem-solving                        aspects of the workshops and concepts components will engage                    the teachers in the kinds of activities and physics                             background necessary to effectively teach secondary physics.                                                                                                    Limitations on time of interaction among workshop                               participants                                                                    and on numbers of minority teachers reached by the workshop will                be addressed through NEWTON.  The staff and the participants will               use NEWTON in order to discuss classroom physics and assigned                   work, to continually evaluate the workshop as well as to organize               physics competition among schools, advertise local and regional                 physics meetings, and other activities whose purpose is to                      invigorate and establish a greater sense of commonality in the                  community of physics educators.                                                                                                                                 An amount equivalent to 30% of the NSF request has been cost-                   shared by the University, the participating school districts and                public and private organizations.",
