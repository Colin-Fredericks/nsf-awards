 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will prepare high-transition temperature superconductive films           by deposition onto cooled substrates.  Reactive sputtering and hot              oxygen jet sputter fabrication techniques will be employed to produce           as-deposited high-quality YBa2Cu3O7-x thin-films.  After the initial            investigation of the composition, microstructure and the DC electrical          properties, these films will be patterned into variable thickness               microbridges for millimeter-wave detection and mixing applications.             Special emphasis will be given to the repeatability of the fabrication          process as it applies to the transition temperature, critical current,          and properties under radiation.                                                                                                                                 In the second stage of the investigation, the microbridges will be              used as heterodyne detectors in the millimeter-wave range.  We have in          our laboratories a good collection of active devices (sources,                  oscillators, detectors, mixers, isolators) and passive components in            the 94 GHz range.  The first goal will be to investigate the microwave          properties of the microbridges by pumping with an rf source at this             frequency.  Then the microbridge will be operated as a mixer.  The              conversion efficiency, and mixer noise will be measured.",
