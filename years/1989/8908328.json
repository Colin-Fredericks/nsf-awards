 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosynthesis is the process whereby plants convert solar energy into          chemical energy.  This process supports all life on this planet.  An in         depth knowledge of how photosynthesis occurs in leaves is necessary for         understanding solar energy conversion by land plants.  The project Leaf         structural properties that influence internal light regime and                  photosynthetic efficiency: Epidermal lens cells and internal leaf               anatomy will examine how leaf anatomy is related to the photosynthetic          performance of the whole leaf.  Specific native plants have been                selected that have unique anatomical features.  The purpose of the              proposed research is to make correlations between the unique leaf               anatomical features, the specialization of the photosynthetic apparatus         within each leaf type, and whole leaf photosynthetic performance.  One          important leaf anatomical character that will be examined is the ability        of the leaf epidermal cells to focus light within the leaf interior via         a lens mechanism.  Current research has shown that these cells can              concentrate light 6-20 times above incident levels.  Moreover, this             epidermal lens action appears to strongly affect light-harvesting by the        chloroplasts located within the leaf.  Microscopy, gas exchange                 measurements and a new fiber optic microprobe technique will be used to         accomplish the objectives of this project.  The resulting information           may be applied to problems that relate to understanding the                     physiological basis for plant biodiversity, increasing crop yield, and          how plants may respond photosynthetically to global climate change              mediated by increased carbon dioxide concentrations.",
