 "awd_abstract_narration": "The availability and accessiblity of the computing and                        networking resources at Bradley University has led many of the                  faculty to incorporate information technology application into                  their curriculum as an integral part of their course offerings,                 and has helped stimulate interest in, and a rapid growth of,                    faculty research.    The purpose of this project is to provide                  access to facilities and resources not available at Bradley                     University and to provide a means of communication between                      Bradley University faculty and  advanced students and their                     counterparts in other institutuions  all over the nation,                       particularly in the sceintific and  technological disciplines                   where progress is rapid and currency  is essential.  This will be               made possible by NSF's support of  appropriate routing equipment                and a medium speed communication  connection (56,000 bits per                   second) to the CICnet, the  appropriate regional network, which                 is in turn connected to the  NSFNET nationwide backbone                         network.",
