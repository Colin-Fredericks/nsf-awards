 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will extend the range of models and problems to               which Bayesian analysis can routinely be applied.  The objectives               of the research include development of theoretical foundations                  and applicable methods for integrating multiple sources of                      information, both prior and data-based.  They also include                      providing the applied statistician with indications of                          robustness with respect to priors and model structure. Other                    objectives are the development of novel modeling techniques to                  extend the applicability of dynamic forecasting and survival                    analysis as well as continued development of numerical methods                  for the evaluation of integrals required in Bayesian analysis.                  Much of the research is based on the development of entirely new                lines of attack made possible by recent advances in computing.                  Accordingly, closely integrated analytical and experimental tools               will be applied.",
