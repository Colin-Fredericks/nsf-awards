 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most promising applications of epitaxial III-V on Si                 materials technology is the monolithic integration of                           optoelectronic functions with Si integrated circuits.  While                    simple implementations of this integrated technology have been                  demonstrated, there has been little attention paid to the types of              heterostructures that are best suited for integration of GaAs and               Si device functions from both material and device perspectives.                 The purpose of this program will be to develop a set of standard                III-V heterostructure components that can be used as building                   blocks for lightwave applications, particularly optoelectronic                  integrated circuits, fabricated by epitaxial growth on large-area               Si substrates using OMCVD.  Phase I of this three phase program                 will determine the feasibility of such a technology through an                  evaluation of AlGaAs/GaAs epitaxial structures grown by OMCVD on                Si substrates.  The experimental structures will be representative              of those needed for the fabrication of optical sources, detectors.              waveguides, and modulators.  The growth and properties of these                 structures will be investigated.                                                                                                                                Phase II will focus on the monolithic integration of these                      components on Si substrates.  In particular, we will explore                    selective epitaxy to implement be integration of the different                  components.  Phase III will focus on the commercialization of this              device technology.",
