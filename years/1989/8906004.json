 "awd_abstract_narration": "The length of time that seeds remain viable in soils of                    natural plant communities has long intrigued ecologists and plant               physiologists.  The proposed project attacks this question                      directly for tundra soils, which are most likely to contain                     long-lived seeds.  Previous work has demonstrated that isolated                 viable seeds are found in abundance in solifluction-buried                      organic soil in alpine tundra environments.  Radiocarbon dates of               both seeds and soil show that the seeds are on the order of                     hundreds of years old, at least.  Preliminary work also suggests                that seeds much older than this are likely to be uncovered by                   additional fieldwork.  The present study will seek still older                  seeds with extensive excavations of six additional solifluction-                buried soil profiles.  These extensive excavations are made                     possible by a grant from Earthwatch, which will support the field               research and will supply volunteers.  To take maximum advantage                 of this opportunity both soils and seeds from these profiles                    will be radiocarbon dated.  Radiocarbon dating of the seeds will                be accomplished using tandem accelerator mass spectrometry, which               allows direct dating of small carbon-containing objects.  Through               a demonstrated procedure, seed coats will be carefully removed                  from emerging seedlings and dated, while the seedlings will be                  transplanted to pots in the greenhouse.  Thus, in addition to                   establishing how long seeds may persist in permafrost soils                     populations of old and young genotypes of known age classes for                 future work will be established.  Soil will be dated with                       conventional radiocarbon dating, and rates of solifluction                      movement will be estimated as a check on the accelerator dates of               the seeds themselves.  Other checks on the accelerator method of                dating will include:  (1) measurement of the 14C/13C radio to                   determine whether isotope discrimination needs to be taken into                 account in the dating procedure, (2) replication of the dating                  procedure on several lobes, and (3) dating of seedlings that                    emerge in the dark, as well as their seed coats.",
