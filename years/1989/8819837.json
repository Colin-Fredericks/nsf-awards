 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kristal's research is directed towards understanding the                    physiological, particularly opioid-mediated, processes involved                 in mammalian birth and postpartum behavior.  Perhaps one of the                 most enigmatic components of the mammalian birth process has been               the ingestion of the afterbirth by the mother.  This                            placentophagia is present in virtually all nonhuman, nonaquatic,                mammalian species.  Recently, with NSF support, Dr. Kristal found               that ingestion of amniotic fluid or placenta by rats experiencing               opioid-mediated analgesia significantly elevates that analgesia.                These data indicate that the placenta and amniotic fluid contain                a substance(s) that enhances opioid-mediated analgesia but does                 not by itself produce analgesia.  The importance of the existence               of such a factor, referred to as Placental Opioid-Enhancing                     Factor (POEF), is that during labor and delivery, pregnancy-                    mediated analgesia can be maximized without so massive a release                of endogenous opioids.  This is very important since too high a                 level of opioids during and immediately after birth can interfere               with maternal behavior.  Dr. Kristal is continuing to                           characterize the effects of the analgesic enhancing effects of                  POEF during parturition and on maternal behavior.  The findings                 will enhance our knowledge of the physiological mechanisms of                   birth and postpartum behavior.  Moreover, the research points the               way toward a new class of non-narcotic analgesics and sheds light               on fundamental processes involved in pain and the body's reaction               to it.",
