 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past three years the need to provide better                             coordination among operating agencies in the many countries                     with Antarctic programs has received increasing attention.                      Agencies from fourteen such countries agreed in Boulder,                        Colorado in June, 1987 to form an organization called,                          Managers of National Antarctic Programs (MNAP).  During the                     XIVth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in October 1987,                    representatives met informally and agreed to associate the                      MNAP organization with the Scientific Committee on Antarctic                    Research (SCAR).  The relationship with SCAR was established                    and the MNAP organization formally adopted at the XX SCAR                       meeting in Hobart, September 1987.                                                                                                                              The American Geophysical Union (AGU) embraces all scientific                    disciplines involved in Antarctic Research, with the                            exception of some of the biological sciences.  The AGU has                      proposed that its administrative offices provide for the                        newly established MNAP group the full range of support                          services, including an Executive Director.  The AGU's                           extensive administrative services and widespread, excellent                     reputation in the scientific community, both nationally and                     internationally, make it the appropriate provider of such                       services.                                                                                                                                                       Funding this award will cover the Executive Director, support                   staff and services, including communications, office                            equipment, supplies, computer services and bookkeeping.  I                      recommend support at the requested level.",
