 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last two decades, the interest and research in the                     benthic and nekton communities of the polar regions has advanced                to the point where remote sampling and observation are limited in               the specific kinds of data that can be recovered.  Dividing                     technology has advanced to the degree that first-hand observations              and experimental manipulations are possible in the shallow water                areas of these previously inaccessible regions.  While the initial              diving investigators were subject to great hardship, advances in                diving equipment have allowed access to a greater number of                     persons, many with very limited knowledge or experience with such               diving environments.  The accumulated experience in these diving                environments lies primarily with a handful of scientific divers                 who have informally passed on the experience to the novice                      participants.  As the number of investigators increases, the                    dissemination of this information becomes more difficult and the                risk of accidents increases.                                                                                                                                    While the safety record for scientific diving operations has to                 date been excellent, it is the result of the organized, formal                  training programs of a general nature at the institutional level.               In general, these programs do not provide a level of training for               polar environments adequate for the accomplishment of cost-                     effective diving operations during the participants first                       exposure.  This Polar Diving Workshop is designed to provide a                  vehicle that will allow the dissemination and practical exchange                of specific information on the unique requirements of scientific                diving operations in polar environments through classroom lecture               and in-water sessions.  The proceedings of the workshop will be                 assembled and printed, providing a source document for research                 diving activities in such environments.",
