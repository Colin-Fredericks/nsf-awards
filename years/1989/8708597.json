 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of the lower crust, Moho, and upper mantle is the               major uncertainty in the genesis of continental lithosphere, and                recent studies have indicated major differences in these among                  different tectonic provinces.  A series of normal incidence and                 wide-angle recording experiments involving discontinuous                        expanding spread profiles around common depth points.  The                      normal-incidence data will determine the detailed layering and                  the wide-angle data will resolve the velocity structure and                     whether it is sharp or gradational.  S-wave data will be recorded               to make combined P-and S-wave interpretations for fluid content                 and lithology.  Areas to be studied include the Basin and Range                 where strong subhorizontal lower-crustal and Moho reflections are               found, an accreted terrain in NE Washington where many arcuate                  lower crustal reflections and some clear discontinuous Moho                     reflections occur, Archean-Proterozoic transitional crust                       (overprinted during the Laramide?) in SE Wyoming with sporadic                  lower crustal and questionable Moho reflections, Proterozoic                    crust in Kansas with abundant arcuate lower crustal reflection                  pattern and no Moho reflections.  These areas provide widely                    varying tectonic regimes, ages, and differences in reflection                   response that must indicate different structure.  Completed pilot               studies show that lower crustal velocity structure can be                       resolved in NE Nevada to address the question of the \"double Moho               reflection,\" and that a Moho reflection is seen at 80 km range in               SE Wyoming but not observed at normal incidence.  Processing will               be based on a combination of standard reflection processing and                 new approaches for improving S/N, tau-P analysis, and migration.                These studies will provide a relatively accurate and detailed                   velocity profile and also mean crustal velocity which can be                    related to tectonic history and continental growth.",
