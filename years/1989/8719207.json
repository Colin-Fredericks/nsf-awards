 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of the properties of Seyfert galaxies at scales                of tens of lightyears to thousands of lightyears will be carried                out.  First, a program of direct imaging and spatially resolved                 spectroscopy of optical emission lines will be continued.  The                  aims are to determine the ionization and kinematical structure of               the gas, the morphology of the narrow line region and its                       relation to the jet-like radio continuum sources, and to isolate                circumnuclear starbursts.  These high resolution observations                   will mainly be made at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory                  (CTIO) and on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  When possible, advantage will                 be taken of seeing compensating systems such as the Image                       Stabilizing Instrument System at Mauna Kea.  Second, the profiles               of several ion species will be determined to investigate                        correlations between velocity spread, critical density,                         ionization potential, and radius in active galaxies.  Third, high               resolution, diffraction limited, imaging observations will be                   made in the 8 - 13 micron band with a new array camera system                   developed at the National Aeronautics Space Administration                      Goddard Space Flight Center.  Fourth, the properties of warm                    molecular gas in the circumnuclear environment will be probed by                means of the 2.12 micron wavelength line of molecular hydrogen.                                                                                                 These data and others will be confronted with spherically                       symmetric infall and wind outflow models of galaxies.  The nature               of the striking morphological similarity between the narrow line                region and the radio continuum sources will be investigated.                    Models in which this connection represents partial beaming of                   the ionizing radiation along the radio axis will be explored.                   Lastly, the data will be used to perform a comprehensive                        investigation of circumnuclear starbursts in Seyfert galaxies.",
