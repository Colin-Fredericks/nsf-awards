 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have completed the first phase of developing a new,                     quantitative method for analyzing a complex record of cyclicity                 beginning with the Cambrian strata of North America.  So far we                 have found two orders of cycles, one consisting of a single long-               term cycle with a wave length of about 70 m.y. and the other                    consisting of repeating short-term cycles with wavelengths of 2                 to 6 m.y.  The pattern cyclicity has been found to occur                        consistently within the ancient passive margins of North America.               The form of this complex signal strongly resembles the form of                  the controversial eustatic sea level curve for the Mesozoic and                 Tertiary that has been constructed using seismic stratigraphic                  methods along the submerged margins of the continents.  A                       eustatic mechanism is also a viable explanation for the Cambrian                cyclicity, and, if correct, is evidence that short-term                         oscillations of sea level have been a dominant factor in the                    evolution of the stratigraphic record for much, if not all, of                  the earth's history.  A tectonic mechanism cannot be ruled out,                 however.  In addition to the question of the origin of the                      cycles, the results of our research have raised the possibility                 that the period of the cycles is not random, but further                        investigation of this problem is hampered by the lack of a                      reliable time scale.  Finally, since our analyses have been                     confined to strata that were deposited mainly within a carbonate                platform, we cannot evaluate the degree to which our new                        procedures have general applicability to the stratigraphic                      record.                                                                              We will conduct a two-year program of research to address                  the questions that have been raised by the results of our                       previous work.  We will to measure sections in key localities                   within the North American craton where it should be possible to                 both test the eustatic versus tectonic origin of the cycles and                 to assess the validity of our methodology in different                          depositional environments.",
