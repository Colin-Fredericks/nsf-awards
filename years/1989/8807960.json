 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will continue investigations of air-land-plant-                   water-human interactions in aggrading and disturbed northern                    hardwood forest ecosystems.  Historically, the Hubbard Brook                    Ecosystem Study has coupled long-term investigation of ecosystem                biogeochemistry and forest growth with detailed experimentation,                including laboratory and plot-level studies, whole ecosystem                    manipulations, as well as the development and application of                    computer models.  Studies of precipitation inputs, ecosystem                    pools and stream outflow will be continued.  This long-term                     biogeochemical research will be integrated with ongoing and                     proposed process-level studies through the development of proton                budgets and analysis of element cycle interactions.  Plot-level                 chemical manipulations using (NH4)2SO4, H2SO4, Na2SO4 and CaSO4                 will investigate present-day, anthropogenically-induced changes                 in hydrogen ion, sulfur, nitrogen and metallic cation cycles.                   Research on northern hardwood forest ecosystems at Hubbard Brook                is a multi-investigator-/multi-institutional effort.  Most work                 will be conducted at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH,                 yet the concepts and processes to be investigated are generally                 applicable to many types of ecosystems.  This research will, as                 in the past, contribute to the fundamental understanding of                     forest ecosystems and yield information useful to the better                    management of their valuable natural resources.                                                                                                                 The project team is excellent and comprises proven collaborative                performers.  USDA/Forest Service collaboration is quite positive.               Institutional accommodations are first-rate.                                                                                                                    The Ecosystem Studies Program confidently recommends that this                  collaborative, four-year continuing award be made.",
