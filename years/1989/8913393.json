 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past studies of transient-driven flows for moderate heating                     conditions have clarified the fluid flow and heat transfer                      responses in transient flows which remain laminar.  Other and                   more recent experiments have shown that more vigorous heating                   results in many different kinds of downstream transient                         transport regimes, depending on the imposed heating rate.  In                   the developing downstream response, both one and two                            dimensional transient instability and transition were found to                  arise.  Measurements also show that very large transient                        transport effects arise locally.  Conventional methods of                       transient instability analysis are limited to approximations                    which are not suitable in some of these regimes.  The study                     proposed here includes two parallel components.  The first is                   the transient laminar flow response to the heating condition.                   The second is the downstream treatment by the developing flow                   of small imposed and random velocity disturbances.  They will                   be introduced, at specific times, at a downstream location                      inside the particular local flow regime of interest.  Their                     evolution will be followed in time or downstream, as                            appropriate.  The subsequent diagnostics will be of resulting                   disturbance growth rates and spectral distributions.  The                       central result will be a numerical model of disturbance growth                  and behavior analysis to understand this phenomena.                                                                                                             Buoyancy driven transient flows arise in many important                         applications.  Such flows are driven by transient heating at a                  vertical bounding surface in a quiescent body of fluid.  These                  kinds of transients arise in many environmental and                             technological processes.  They may follow from changing                         radiative heating of a surface.  The are also inherent in                       batch processing operations, in the start up and shutdown of                    equipment.  They are common in electrical transients in large                   high density electronic arrays.  They are also very important                   in assessing the cooling of internally heated elements after a                  power or pump failure.  This research seeks to understand the                   heat transfer and flow when transient heating leads to                          unstable flows and to transition.",
