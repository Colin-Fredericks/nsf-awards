 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary relationships among the 135 genera of                         sunflowers of the tribe Astereae, an ecologically important group               especially in the American West, are poorly known.  What                        discussion of this topic there has been in the literature has                   concentrated mostly on possible modes of change in chromosome                   numbers within the tribe, but even that issue remains unresolved.               Dr. Meredith Lane, under a Career Advancement Award, will work in               the laboratory of Dr. Robert Jansen at University of Connecticut                to learn the powerful new techniques of chloroplast DNA                         restriction site mapping.  She will use these methods to study 33               genera in the complex, to obtain comparative data.  These data                  will be used in a computer-aided phylogenetic analysis and                      compared to a similar analysis of morphological data.  Such a                   phylogeney will help resolve the question of the mode of                        chromosome number evolution in the Astereae and will clarify                    intergeneric taxonomic relationships.                                                A number of specific questions about the taxonomic status of               several problematic genera such as Lessingia and Benitoa, and                   Chrysothamnus and Ericameria can be answered using the                          comparative DNA information.  Work will also begin on the large                 genus Haplopappus and its relatives.  Dr. Jansen's laboratory is                a very active one, and collaborative interactions with other                    systematists will enhance possiblities for future research by Dr.               Lane.",
