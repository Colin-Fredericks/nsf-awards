 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thermoluminescence dating (TL) is a technique which holds out                   great promise for archaeology in the age determination of                       inorganic materials, especially in the period beyond 50,000 years               ago.  Unfortunately, many complications in the use of the                       technique need to be resolved before it can be used routinely and               with precision.                                                                                                                                                 Drs. Hornyak and Franklin will conduct a one year project to                    further develop the TL technique for archaeological materials as                applied to situations for which other techniques (e.g. C14) are                 limited or not available.  Such situations include the dating of                sediments in archaeological deposits, objects older that the                    limits for C14 (over 50,000 years), and inorganic specimens with                no associated carbon deposits, and objects, such as pottery,                    whose archaeological context has been lost, as in museums.                                                                                                      The development of TL dating is of extreme importance and the                   PI's are well-qualified and experienced to undertake this                       important project.",
