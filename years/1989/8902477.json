 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Twelfth International Conference on General Relativity                 and Gravitation is the next in a series of meetings held once                   every three years, under the auspices of the International                      Society on General Relativity and Gravitation.  This conference,                (known as \"GR-12\"), will be held in Boulder, Colorado from July                 2-8, 1989.                                                                           The subjects of General Relativity and Gravitation have                    assumed increasing importance in the past decade or so.  Ties to                High-Energy Particle Physics arise from studies of cosmology and                of the early moments in the formation of the universe.  New                     astronomical observations and astrophysical studies make the                    existence of extremely massive black holes in active galactic                   nuclei seem very likely.  Evidence for black holes in other                     objects and for the importance of relativistic effects in many                  astronomical events such as the emission of jets from radio                     galaxies also exists.  Observation of the binary pulsar and of                  distances to the moon and other planets have permitted very                     accurate tests of gravitational theory.  Development of new                     techniques for detection of gravitational waves are proceeding.                      This award will support travel costs for invited speakers                  and travel funds to support conference participants from the                    United States.",
