 "awd_abstract_narration": "The establishment of a broad base of fundamental information on                 the thermodynamics of polyolefin mixtures in the melt state will                be accomplished by a combination of small-angle neutron                         scattering (SANS) measurements of the liquid mixtures and                       equation-of-state (EOS) measurements on the pure component                      liquids.  Model homopolymers and copolymers, synthesized by                     anionic polymerization of dienes and subsequent hydrogenation,                  will be used in the initial stages of the work.  Labelled                       samples, needed for SANS, will be obtained by using deuterium in                place of the hydrogen.  The highly uniform structure of these                   model materials, and a judicious selection of copolymer pairings,               should provide single-phase liquid mixtures for samples in the                  polymeric size range and a relatively clean analysis of the SANS                data.  The EOS measurements will permit the use of liquid-state                 theory to interpret and generalize the results.  The influences                 of copolymer sequence distribution and co-mer size will be                      studied, and bridging to commercial polyolefins will be started.                Aside from supplying thermodynamic data for an extremely                        important class of polymeric materials, the proposed work will                  provide tests of current theories for polymer mixtures where the                local interactions are simple and the local structures are well                 defined.  It also provides the essential basis and appropriate                  model materials for studies on the dynamics of phase separation,                leading to the design of solid-state morphologies in amorphous                  and semicrystalline polymer blends.",
