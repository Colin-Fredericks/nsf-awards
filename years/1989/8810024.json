 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the University of Rochester, in association                  with the Eastman Kodak Company and the Xerox Corporation requests               funds to  establish a Science and Technology Center for                         Photoinduced Charge Transfer.  The Director of the Center will be               Professor David G. Whitten.                                                                                                                                     The goal of the research is to achieve a molecular level                        understanding of the four major events of photoinduced charge                   transfer processes (i.e., activation processes; initial charge                  transfer; charge separation, transport and trapping; chemical                   reactions of charged species).  Thus, the research will focus on                the fundamentals of electron transfer processes themselves.  The                Center will involve studies of photoexcitation and field-assisted               charge separation and transport in diverse media (including                     solids, organized, and amorphous media), in semiconductor                       particles, across interfaces, and in fluid media.  These studies                will naturally lead into the spectrum of photobiological                        processes, where electron transfer plays a key role.  Parallel                  efforts will be directed towards applications of electron                       transfer processes.  One example of this type of study will be                  the exploration of chemical bond activation by single electron                  transfer.                                                                                                                                                       The breadth of the research expertise at the three sites is most                appropriate for the proposed research activities, ranging from                  solid state physics, materials science, to electrochemistry and                 preparative chemistry, new laser technology, and colloid and                    surface science.",
