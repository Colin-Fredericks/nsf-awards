The unique aspects of these data,                already in hand, are (1) that 100 ground flashes (about 350                     stokes) whose fields are recorded on the analog tapes have                      already been accurately located by two or more television cameras               and (2) that the return stroke fields on these tapes have been                  previously analyzed and the results published providing assurance               that the signals are \"on-scale\" and of good quality.",
