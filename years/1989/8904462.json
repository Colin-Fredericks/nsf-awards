 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to study the function of individual                 ion channels and pumps involved in membrane transport and                       bioenergetics.  The proposed research will use patch-clamp                      methods and lipid-bilayer reconstitution to investigate ion                     channels and pumps in the plasma membrane of the yeast                          Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The initial goals will be to                         characterize the behavior of potassium ion channels and the                     proton pump working in isolation.  To relate the patch-clamp data               to whole-cell physiology, the function of the channels and pumps                in wild type yeast will be compared with that in known transport                mutants.  Currently mutants of the PMA1 gene are being studied.                 This gene codes for the plasma membrane ATPase, and its mutation                gives rise to a variety of phenotypic changes in cell function,                 including altered coupling between the pump and potassium                       transport.  Patch clamp experiments thus far show differences in                function of voltage-gated potassium-ion channels for wild-type                  and for transport-deficient mutants.                                                                                                                            In all cells the major ion transporters work in concert to                      accumulate certain ions within the cytoplasm in concentrations                  much greater than in the external environment while excluding                   other ion species.  This highly selective control of the ionic                  environent, though essential for normal cell growth and                         development is still poorly understood.  In particular, it is not               really known how voltage-gated ion channels in inexcitable cells                interact with electrogenic ion pumps to control the membrane                    potential and how membrane potential, in turn, acts in regulating               the function of various membrane channels and pumps.   The                      results of this research should provide important new insights                  into this fundamental problem in cell biology.",
