 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simple concepts such as mother, ball, and red are the building                  blocks of human thought.  What sort of knowledge is involved in                 acquiring and having concepts like these?  This question has been               pursued vigorously in recent years, but there is still no                       satisfactory answer.  Part of the reason may be that many of the                existing studies have looked only at knowledge of concrete                      objects such as birds and chairs.  However, a wide range of other               concepts, such as those concerning kin relations, social status,                emotions, colors, and physical states, are equally important to                 human thought.  The data available on these other concepts                      suggests that current theories of concepts may be limited in                    several important ways.  This research will address these                       limitations by asking three related questions about the nature of               concepts:  (1)  What sorts of knowledge are involved in having                  concepts from diverse domains such as kin, emotion, and color?                  (2) What implicit beliefs do people have about what it means to                 have knowledge in the different domains, and how do those beliefs               affect the way that they use words for concepts in these domains?               (3) How do concepts held by experts in various fields differ from               \"ordinary\" concepts, if they do at all?   The research will                     address these issues through a combination of laboratory studies                on the nature of everyday concepts, observational studies on how                words for certain concepts are used in daily conversation, and                  interview studies of experts on the nature of their specialized                 concepts.  Answers to the three questions will help pinpoint                    limitations of the traditional theories and will provide the                    basis for a more complete account of what it means to have these                concepts.                                                                                                                                                       The study of concepts has provided the foundation for many                      applications in the health and mental health fields, including                  research on the nature of diagnostic categories in psychiatry and               other branches of medicine, the nature of concepts used in                      related fields such as biology, and the acquisition of concepts                 by normal and mentally retarded children.  The results of this                  project will lead to improved theories that can provide more                    effective applications in these areas.  The results will also be                useful in designing computer systems that store information in                  ways compatible with what the human user knows, so that the human               user can have easy and productive interactions with the computer.",
