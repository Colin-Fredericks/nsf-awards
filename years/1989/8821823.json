 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines an extension of recent work on structured                modeling frameworks that includes the development of a prototype                modeling system based on this extended framework.  The proposal is              interesting because it involves a very creative and productive                  investigator in a project that includes elements from three important           areas of operations research: model representation, construction of             modeling systems, and algorithmic design.  The development of a                 prototype mathematical programming modeling system, for which the               database environment would itself generate the models, represents an            important next step in the design and application of modeling                   systems.  A number of management scientists and other researchers are           interested in this area but the approach suggested in the proposal,             which would apply object-oriented programming languages to address              model construction, is considered to be novel and highly promising.             The scope of the project is ambitious but necessarily so, with the              potential for a high payoff regarding issues of model management that           would be of central theoretical and applied interest to the                     operations research and management science research communities.",
