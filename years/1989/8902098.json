 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Helton's project is research in mathematics that                 has applications to problems in engineering. The mathematics                    involves matrix-valued functions on planar regions such as the                  disc. Among these there is a particularly well-behaved class of                 functions called analytic. Best-approximation of more or less                   arbitrary functions by analytic ones, and finding analytic                      functions that take on prescribed values at prescribed points in                the region are problems that turn out to be important in the                    design of feedback stabilized control systems. By applying                      methods of functional analysis and operator theory, Helton seeks                efficient ways of solving problems like these.                                       Helton's point of view is that commutant lifting in operator               theory is nearly equivalent to interpolation theory for matrix-                 valued functions. He will seek to develop a nonlinear commutant                 lifting theory, and to link it with the existing theory of                      nonlinear control systems. He will investigate qualitative and                  numerical aspects of optimization over spaces of analytic                       functions; computational experiment and theoretical insight will                support one another mutually in this part of the project.                       A further aspect of the work involves matrix completion, filling                in the entries of a partially specified matrix so as to make the                result have a particular property such as positivity. Throughout,               Helton will keep in view applications to optimal control and                    worst case design in the frequency domain.",
