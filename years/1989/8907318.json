 "awd_abstract_narration": "Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a thermodynamic                      technique and as such is powerful, yet noninvasive, in studying                 either the thermotropic phase behavior of lipids or the unfolding               or folding of globular proteins upon heating or cooling.  In this               application, funds to purchase a high-resolution differential                   scanning calorimeter are requested.  This instrument must have                  the capability of performing in ascending and descending thermal                scans over the temperature range of -40 to 100oC.  The proposed                 research projects can be grouped into two categories.  In the                   first, the heating and cooling thermograms of various binary                    lipid mixtures will be determined.  The phase diagrams of these                 mixtures will then be constructed based on these thermograms, and               the lipid-lipid interactions in the bilayer phase will be                       analyzed quantitatively.  The lipid mixtures to be investigated                 include unsatured phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and                             phosphatidylcholine (PC) and their headgroup derivatives with                   saturated mixed-chain PC, various PC with glycospingolipids, and                glycosphingolipids/cholesterol mixtures.  The second category                   concerns calorimetric studies involving proteins.  The stability                of ubiquitins obtained from various selective mutants will be                   investigated.  The interactions of cytochrome b5 with various                   phospholipids will also be studied.  Finally, the rhodopsin                     unfolding in a variety of phospholipid bilayers will be studied.",
