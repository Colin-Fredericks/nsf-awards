 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to replace some of the research                equipment at the University of Rhode Island's Marine Geomechanics               Laboratory (URI/MGL) that is being removed by a previous                        sponsoring agency, and to replace some used, outmoded equipment                 with state-of-the-art equipment and instrumentation for research                on marine sediments.  The MGL facility has been an                              internationally recognized source for state-of-the-art                          developments in understanding the behavior of deep marine                       sediments and significant contributions have been made through                  field and laboratory studies and computer analysis.                                                                                                             The project is directed at enhancing and extending the research                 capabilities of the current URI/MGL facility.  The acquisition of               the equipment requested in this proposal will greatly enhance the               ability to carry on current and projected research.  The primary                specific projects that will directly benefit include: a) the                    ongoing NSF sponsored research on creep processes (in second year               of 3-year project), b) a proposed program to study the as yet                   unexplained phenomenon of underconsolidation seen in certain deep               sea regimes, c) a proposed program to study the processes by                    which debris flows are initiated, and d) a broader program on                   submarine slope processes.  Other studies of nearshore sediments                have been initiated.  Most of the research is of critical                       importance to the nation in terms of utilization of the Exclusive               Economic Zone for commercial and security needs.",
