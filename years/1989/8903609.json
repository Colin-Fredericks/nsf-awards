 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomarkers are compounds in geological samples whose basic                 carbon skeleton resembles that of their precursors which occur in               source materials such as algae, bacteria and higher plants.  For                the most part the biomarkers discovered to date have been in the                C10-C40 range.  Limitations in both chromatography and mass                     spectrometry have prevented the successful investigation and                    identification of biomarkers in the region above C40.  It is                    proposed to take advantage of developments of high temperature                  capillary columns and tandem mass spectrometers to enter into the               frontier area of biomarker geochemistry in the range of C40-C100.               Extracts from a variety of well characterized oils and source                   rocks will be investigated by tandem mass spectrometry in                       combination with gas chromatography or the direct insertion                     probe.  The samples selected will be those whose lower molecular                weight biomarkers have already been extensively characterized.                  Initially optimum analytical conditions required for the analyses               of such novel high molecular weight components will be determined               by the use of naturally occurring waxes known to contain long                   chain n-alkanes.  In a parallel approach, attempts will be made                 to synthesize high molecular weight hopane standards by                         condensation of hopanoic acids and suitable alkanes or                          isoprenoids.  The resultant products will be characterized by GC-               MS/MS and direct insertion probe MS/MS.  In addition it is                      proposed to use tandem mass spectrometry in combination with                    micropyrolysis techniques to investigate the high molecular                     weight fragments produced by pyrolytic degradation of kerogens,                 protokerogens and other insoluble organic materials.                                 The identification of such compounds will expand the utility               of biomarkers in many aspects of geochemistry.  It should result                in a better understanding of paleoclimate and paleoenvironment,                 biochemical evolution and processes affecting petroleum                         composition and evolution.  With the advances in instrumental                   technology it is anticipated that there will be an increasing                   move towards the study of high molecular weight biomarkers.  This               proposal presents the first formal and systematic search for                    these compounds.//",
