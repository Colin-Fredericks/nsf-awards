 "awd_abstract_narration": "Injecting biologically active solutions into cells and tissues is               an integral part of most biomedical research, but the                           instrumentation available for these procedures is crude,                        cumbersome, and imprecise.  Dr. David B. Wallace with MicroFab                  Technologies, Inc. has developed a solid-state piezoelectric                    \"pump\" that could replace mechanical pumps, iontophoresis, and                  pressure-injection systems in many biomedical research                          applications.  Compared to conventional systems, the                            piezoelectric pump could provide vastly smaller pumping volumes,                greater reliability and accuracy, simultaneous \"push-pull\"                      pumping modes, and convenient (solid-state) automation and                      control of fluid delivery/removal programs.                                                                                                                     MicroFab plans to build and test piezoelectric pumps for                        injecting drugs into tissues or cells.  The firm has developed                  piezopumps for many applications, but biomedical uses will                      require pumping through considerable smaller orifices and against               higher fluid resistance.  MicroFab will test piezopump                          performance under simulated intravital pumping conditions and                   determine such matters as minimum orifice for reliable pumping,                 minimum and maximum reliable flow rates, and pumping accuracy.                  The piezoelectric pumping system could substantially expand the                 research capabilities of most biomedical research laboratories;                 procedures now difficult or impossible may be come routine with                 the solid-state pump.",
