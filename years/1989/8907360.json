 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research team, lead by Dr. Michael Jochim, will conduct a                     survey and archaeological excavation in the Federsee region of                  Germany.  Prior work by Dr. Jochim has revealed the presence of a               Late/Terminal Mesolithic site, Henauhof West, which is located                  near an extinct shoreline of Lake Federsee.  The site holds great               potential because materials lie in a layer of waterlogged peat                  and this has resulted in the excellent preservation of cultural                 remains.  Not only faunal remains but also fragile plant                        specimens can be recovered.  The materials recovered from these                 excavations will be analyzed to show changing patterns of                       subsistence and material culture during the transition from Late                to Terminal Mesolithic.  Dr. Jochim will also conduct a regional                survey to locate other sites.                                                                                                                                   This period of Central European prehistory is of interest because               it marks the first appearance of agriculturalists in an area                    which until then had been occupied solely by hunting and                        gathering societies.  During the Late Mesolithic the Federsee                   region was inhabited solely by such foraging peoples.  In the                   Terminal period the first agriculturalists most likely appeared                 from the Southeast.  Archaeologists have speculated on the effect               of this contact and have proposed a number of models for the                    interaction which resulted.  Some have suggested that hostility                 was the norm while other believe that rapid assimilation took                   place.  Very little data however are available to address this                  issue and, for this reason, Dr. Jochim's work is of great                       interest.                                                                                                                                                       From a broader perspective, this research is important for                      several reasons.  First, it examines the interactions between                   more and less technologically advanced societies, and the general               principles which emerge may be applicable to many situations,                   including contemporary ones.  Secondly, because of the close                    cooperation between the German and American teams, scientific                   ties between the two countries will be strengthened.",
