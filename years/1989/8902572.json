 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program is an experimental study of scientifically and                      technologically important point defects in elemental and compound               semiconductors using optical detection of magnetic resonance                    (ODMR) and optical detection of electron-nuclear double resonance               (ODENDOR).  The theory of such defects in semiconductors, the                   \"deep level\" problem, has made exciting new advances recently.                  The investigation outlined in this program is directed toward                   determining the identification and microscopic lattice                          configuration of the defects, and mapping out the electronic and                vibronic structure in their ground and excited states --                        information vital to guide and confront theory.  The power and                  potential of ODMR and ODENDOR for such studies has been                         demonstrated dramatically by experiments conducted under the                    present grant.  In the proposed renewal program, new ODMR and                   ENDOR experiments are outlined for the study of the intrinsic                   lattice defects (vacancies, interstitials, Frenkel pairs,                       antisites, etc.) as well as some of the more important chemical                 impurities and simple complexes resulting from their                            interactions.  A new direction to our studies will be afforded by               the instrumentation of time-resolved ODMR for the study of the                  poorly understood dynamics of luminescence and energy transfer                  processes in these materials.",
