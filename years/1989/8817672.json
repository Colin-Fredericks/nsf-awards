Rittmann at the University of Illinois include                                  evaluation of the rate at which soluble metabolic                               products are produced during anaerobic processes for                            wastewater treatment, determination of their chelation                          properties and role in reducing metal toxicity during                           the respiratory process.  A unified conceptual model                            will be developed and utilized as a basis for                                   evaluation of more rational approaches to design of                             treatment processes than are now possible be based on                           effects of solids retention time, metal and substrate                           loading on metal toxicity to the reaction and                                   nutritional requirements of the methanogenic organisms                          involved in the treatment process.                                                                                                                              This is a project that is responsive to recent findings                         regarding the role played by residual metabolic                                 products and trace metals in anaerobic wastewater                               treatment.  Through this cooperative project, the                               investigators will coordinate their work utilizing                              intermediate results to relate results of chemostat                             research to comparable reactions on fixed biofilms                              reactors.  Results are expected to result in                                    improvements in engineering design of biotreatment                              processes used for industrial and municipal treatment                           practice.",
