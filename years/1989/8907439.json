 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University and Jepson Herbaria (UC/JEPS) at the                        University of California at Berkeley is the sixth largest                       herbarium in the United States and the largest at a public                      university.  Current holdings total approximately 1.7 million                   specimens.  UC/JEPS holds the world's best collections of                       California plants, Pacific South American algae, Philippine                     plants and South African algae.                                                      UC/JEPS has been supported by the National Science                         Foundation during the past five years to provide additional                     storage cases for the collections and to assist in the curation                 of the backlog of unprocessed collections.  The University of                   California at Berkeley is in the process of reorganizing biology                and providing new facilities and buildings for the biological                   sciences.  As part of this reorganization UC/JEPS will be moving                to temporary quarters.  During the stay in temporary quarters,                  UC/JEPS will continue to work on processing its backlog of                      specimens, upgrading its storage facilities, and preparing for                  the move back into renovated space on the Berkeley campus.  This                project will provide funds to continue curation of the                          phycological and vascular plant backlogs.  In both cases                        specimens will be processed for incorporation into the permanent                collection, for exchange, or as gifts for determination.  Two Lab               Helpers will be supported to assist with technical tasks                        associated with preparation of labels, sorting of specimens,                    filing of collections, and moving the collections and archives.                 Funds will also be provided for the purchase of herbarium cases                 to provide a 16% expansion in storage space.",
