 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project's main goal is to study relationships between                  the topology of real algebraic varieties and algebro-geometric                  properties of these varieties.  It is divided into the following                areas of research:  (1) regular mappings (i.e. real algebraic                   morphisms) and polynomial mappings, (2) algebraic homology and                  cohomology of real algebraic varieties, (3) comparison between                  algebraic and topological K-theory of real algebraic varieties.                 Methods to be applied are the combinations of various techniques                of algebraic and differential topology, and algebraic geometry.                      As opposed to the more common investigations of algebraic                  varieties over the complex numbers or another algebraically                     closed field, real algebraic geometry has a more vivid visual                   appeal and a much less highly developed and satisfactory theory.                On the other hand, applications of real geometry may be more                    natural, for example, applications to the motion of robot arms,                 where the appropriate interpretation of imaginary coordinate                    values is ordinarily that the corresponding positions cannot be                 attained.",
