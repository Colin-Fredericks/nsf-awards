 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cincinnati Art Museum, which holds important collections of                 prehistoric North American artifacts, will deaccession these                    materials in 1989.  The Cincinnati Museum of Natural History                    (CMNH) has agreed to accept responsibility for them, and support                from the National Science Foundation will assist in this process.               Appropriate storage cases to house the collection and computer                  hardware to aid in its recataloguing will be purchased.  Because                of the magnitude of the project, addition staff will be hired.                  These actions will insure that the collection is properly stored                and made available to the research community.                                                                                                                   The collection is important because it is essentially regional in               nature and consists of archaeological objects from southwestern                 Ohio and the middle Ohio Valley, as well as complete ceramic                    vessels from Arkansas.  Rare engraved shell objects from eastern                Tennessee are also included.  The collection spans the gamut of                 prehistory in eastern North America and contains a significant                  group of proto-historic objects.  Thus, it documents the rise of                complex Native American societies and shows the effect of contact               between these groups and European cultures.  It is useful to                    archaeologists interested in North American prehistory and the                  effects of culture contact and change.                                                                                                                          Archaeological collections such as this one serve to document                   America's past and stand as important archaeological data.  To                  realize their potential, however, they must be preserved and made               available to researchers.  This project is essential because it                 will make such materials available for scientific study.",
