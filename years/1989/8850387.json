 "awd_abstract_narration": "This science teacher development project at the University of                   Wisconsin - La Crosse will provide secondary teachers/leaders                   with training in using STS (Science, Technology and Society)                    topics to teach scientific relevance, to investigate                            technological problem solving and to address some of the                        major issues in modern society.  Thirty-six junior high and                     senior high teachers will be enrolled in each of the 1989 and                   1990 summer workshops.  Teachers from the upper midwest (WI,                    MN, IA, IL) will be invited to attend the program.  The                         intensive four-week workshops will review pertinent                             scientific concepts, study the technological applications of                    this science and discuss at length the related interaction                      with society.                                                                                                                                                   Major studies are planned in energy alternatives, the use and                   misuse of chemicals, and the environmental crises.                              Participants will review existing STS teaching materials and                    develop teaching techniques that have immediate applicability                   in their science curriculum.                                                                                                                                    The formal workshop instruction will also emphasize                             laboratory activities which illustrate the STS topics and can                   be used, with minimal modification, in the science classroom.                   The instruction will be supplemented with seminars by                           established science/technology professionals and tours that                     have proven educational value.  Special efforts will be made                    to integrate participant experiences into the project.                                                                                                          During a nine month follow-up project all participants will                     work under the direction of the workshop staff to first                         implement the workshop materials in their existing science                      course(s), but later to integrate STS topics into the total                     science curriculum.  A portion of the participants will also                    be encouraged to provide STS inservice programs for their                       and/or nearby school districts.  Participants will make                         formal presentations of their implementation efforts at a two                   day follow-up meeting of the Wisconsin Society of Science                       Teachers and will be encouraged to become active in a                           regional STS network.                                                                                                                                           This type of project is important to the Teacher Enhancement                    Program since it tests the hypothesis that when curricular                      materials addresses problems of immediate concern to the                        students they are more likely to develop an interest and                        master the concepts presented.                                                                                                                                  The University, the School Districts and various industries                     will contribute an amount equal to 22% of the NSF award.",
