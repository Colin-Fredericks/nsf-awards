 "awd_abstract_narration": "Endocytosis plays a fundamental role in a number of processes,                  including nutrient uptake, growth factor action, antigen                        presentation and maintenance of plasma membrane composition.                    Somatic cell genetics has been successfully used to analyze                     protions of the complex endocytic system.  In order to stimulate                T lymphocytes, most protein antigens must be cleaved into peptide               domains and expressed on the surface of an antigen-presenting                   cell in association with the products of the major                              histocompatibility complex (MHC).  To provide information about                 the specific enzymes involved in antigen presentation, mutants of               an antigen-presenting cell line which are defective in cathepsin                B, an endoprotease, will be isolated by flow sorting.  The                      ability of these mutants to present antigen to T cells will be                  determined.  The putative mutants will be useful in exploring the               mechanism of antigen presentation, in reconstituting endocytic                  processing in vitro, and in analyzing the pathways by which                     hydrolytic enzymes are delivered to endocytic compartments.                                                                                                     Internalization of materials from the extracellular environment                 (endocytosis) is a fundamental cellular function.  Among the                    important physiological processes that depend upon endocytosis is               the processing and presentation of immunogenic foreign substances               (antigens) by certain cell types (antigen-presenting cells) to                  other cells of the immune system.  The proposed research will                   enhance our understanding of how foreign antigens are processed                 in antigen presenting cells.  This knowledge will be important                  not only from the point of view of the immune response, but also                because it will provide further insight into the fate of                        extracellular materials taken into cells by endocytosis.",
