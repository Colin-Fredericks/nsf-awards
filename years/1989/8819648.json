 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Planetary Boundary Layer Modeling Study\"                                                                                                                            One of the important aspects of modeling the atmosphere for                numerical weather prediction, synoptic storms analyses, and                     climate studies, involves the representation of the physical                    processes in the planetary boundary layer (pbl), the atmospheric                layer closest to the surface.  Between the gross simplifications                of bulk-type constant coefficients and the sophistication, but                  computationally high-cost, of higher order closure of the                       turbulence equations, there is room for improvement.  The                       principal investigator's pbl model is a good candidate for                      exploring this area.  It is a two-level model that depends on the               atmospheric stratification, surface roughness, and baroclinicity.               Winds obtained with the model can be used to estimate the                       surface winds and wind stresses needed to determine the fluxes of               momentum, heat, and moisture into the boundary layer.  Under this               award, the principal investigator hopes to demonstrate that his                 relatively simple analytical pbl model can provide estimates of                 the boundary properties that are comparable to results obtained                 with very complex pbl models, but with considerable savings in                  computations.  The applicability of the model results will also                 be tested by comparing them with actual measurements of the                     boundary layer under a variety of atmospheric conditions.                       Finally, the principal investigator will evaluate the role that                 large scale eddies play in the boundary layer.                                                                                                                  This research is important because a full understanding of the                  extremely complex processes of the atmospheric boundary layer,                  and their representation in numerical models, continues to elude                the atmospheric sciences community.",
