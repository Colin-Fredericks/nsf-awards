 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference on neural development will focus on cellular and                molecular mechanisms which are essential for the development of                 the system.  It is the objective of this program to bring                       together some of the most active research scientists in areas                   related to this main theme, as well as a group of some 100                      additional scientists with interests related to the topic.  Not                 only will these participants present their most recent findings,                but they will find new insight from other presentations and                     numerous discussions in this informal setting.  Hopefully, some                 totally new approaches to studies of neural development may be                  formulated based on collaborative ventures established at this                  conference.  The multidisciplinary approach will be emphasized by               an organization in which there is a progression throughout the                  conference starting with a discussion of mechanisms involved in                 the process of induction, particularly neural induction.  This                  will be followed by sessions on cell lineage and determination,                 neurotransmitters as developmental signals, formation of neural                 pathways and targets, and neural crest development.  Each topic                 will occupy a whole day (morning and evening) with the afternoon                free for informal interactions and discussion.",
