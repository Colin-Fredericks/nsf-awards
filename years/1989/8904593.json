 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on variations in the Nd and Sr isotopic                   composition and REE abundance patterns in Proterozoic and Archean               chemical sediments.  It's purpose is to trace the major mass                    fluxes in the exogenic geochemical cycle through the Proterozoic                and to understand the relationship between the evolution of the                 sedimentary reservoir, the oceans and the atmosphere during this                time period.  We will concentrate on measurements of Nd and Sr                  isotope variations and REE abundance patterns on samples of                     Proterozoic marine sediments.  The following specific projects                  are proposed:  1) Determine 143Nd/144Nd variations in Proterozoic               carbonates and shales.; 2) Determine REE patterns of banded iron                formations ranging in age from - 0.8 Ga to 3.5 Ga.; 3) Modeling                 of the Sr and Nd isotope records of the exogenic geochemical                    cycle through the past 3.5 Ga, emphasizing the Proterozoic.; and                4) Extend the record of high precision Sr isotopic data of                      carbonates from the mid-Cambrian to - 2.0 Ga ago, using well                    dated and documented samples from Victoria Island (N.W.T.,                      Canada), and various sedimentary basins in Australia.                                We propose to establish a detailed, precise record of Sr and               Nd isotopic variations of chemical sediments for the time between               0.5 and 2.0 Ga ago.  During the Proterozoic, seawater Nd and Sr                 budgets appear to have changed from dominantly hydrothermal                     inputs (as in the Archean) to dominantly continental (river)                    inputs.  Data obtained from this research will be used to                       constrain the changes in rates of hydrothermal circulation,                     continental erosion rates and variations in the mean age of                     continental erosion products through the Proterozoic.",
