 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Higson's project has to do with the use and                      management of index information in the theory of operator                       algebras. One major thrust will be in the Dirac operator approach               to relative K-homology for manifolds with boundary advocated by                 Baum, Douglas, and Taylor, with an emphasis on developing                       techniques for computing one of the connecting homomorphisms in                 the six-term exact sequence for this theory. Another area of                    investigation is index theory for the C*-algebra generated by                   bounded smoothing operators supported in a uniform neighborhood                 of the diagonal on an open manifold. Certain distinguished                      subalgebras of this algebra will also be considered.                                 The notion of index pervades a great deal of mathematics.                  Elementary manifestations can be found in, for instance, the                    winding number that measures the number of times a point moving                 in a closed planar orbit winds around a fixed point inside, and                 the number of arbitrary constants in the general solution of a                  linear differential equation. An important theorem, now a couple                of decades old, relates index behavior for differential equations               on a manifold (surface or higher-dimensional analogue) to                       information about the manifold's general shape, or topology,                    expressible in terms of things like winding numbers. It has been                discovered more recently that richly structured mathematical                    systems called operator algebras provide an auspicious framework                for powerful extensions of the original index theorem. The work                 of Professor Higson will expand and strengthen this framework.",
