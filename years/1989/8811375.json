 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this effort is to construct ocean-basin scale                  models of plankton dynamics in the North Atlantic and the North                 Pacific in support of the overall objectives of the U.S. Global                 Ocean Flux Study sponsored by NSF and NASA.  These new                          physical-biological models will utilize historical data on the                  climatological mixed layer depth , historical data on the large                 scale, wind-driven Ekman flux at the base of the mixed layer,                   and the GEOSECS nutrient chemistry data in the North Atlantic                   and North Pacific.  These ocean-basin scale models will study                   how seasonal mixed layer deepening and shallowing, along with                   wind-driven Ekman upwelling and downwelling, interacts with the                 vertical gradient of dissolved nutrients to determine the total                 amount of limiting nutrient available to the plankton                           ecosystem.  This in turn determines the biological productivity                 of the ocean.  Maps will be produced by the model of the                        monthly and annual primary production in the North Atlantic and                 eastern North Pacific basins.  Estimates will be made of the                    interannual variability in primary production due to                            interseasonal fluctuations in the large scale wind stress over                  the North Atlantic.                                                             %%%                                                                                                                                                             The models will incorporate details on the physiological growth                 rate of the phytoplankton, enabling resolution of regional                      variations in chlorophyll content of the plant population.                      This will enable direct comparison of model predictions of the                  phytoplankton distribution to ocean-basin scale composites of                   historical CZCS images of surface chlorophyll.  These basin-                    wide models will be validated by comparison to plankton                         abundance and productivity data published in the literature,                    and historical CZCS imagery.  New data forthcoming from the                     GOFS field program and new ocean color imagery may or may not                   become available for assimilation into these models within the                  time frame of this proposal (1988-1991).  However, this                         modeling effort can help provide an essential link between                      general theory and observations planned by GOFS investigators.",
