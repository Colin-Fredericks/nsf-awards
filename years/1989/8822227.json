 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by seven                      U.S. scientists in a \"Spring School and Workshop on Supernovae                  and Stellar Evolution\" to be held at the Tata Institute of                      Fundamental Research in Bombay, India, March 8-17, 1989.  The                   Indian organizers are Drs. Alak Ray and T. Velusamy of TIFR.                    Topics to be discussed include:  stellar evolution of single                    stars, stellar evolution in close binaries; gravitational                       collapse; nuclear physics in the collapse and bounce phases,                    equation of state of supernovae matter; neutrino diffusion and                  interactions; shock formation and propagation; neutron star                     formation and early cooling; supernovae light curves and                        spectra; products of supernovae; and statistics of supernovae,                  pulsar and supernova remnants.  It is expected that 35-40                       relatively young scientists from India and other countries                      will participat by invitations, in addition to the lectures                     from India and the U.S.  The objectives of the workshop are:                    1) To discuss advances in the field especially since the                        occurance of the Supernovae of 1987 (SN1987A); and 2) to                        identify areas for possible joint research.                                                                                                                     Scope:  This workshop will bring scientists from India and the                  U.S. together to discuss a topic in which activities have been                  strong in the two countries.  The recently observed phenomena                   SN1987A has stimulated new thinking and new approaches to                       theories and data interpretation regarding stellar evolution.                   There is already a level of Indo-U.S. cooperation in research                   in the field, and this workshop is likely to enhance it as                      well as provide for exchage of information among the                            participants.",
