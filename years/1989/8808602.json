 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant recent advance in medical technology has been             the development of the cochlear implant.  This is a device which                is surgically attached to the cochlea, or inner ear, connecting                 electrodes to cochlear nerves.  The wearer carries a small radio-               like device outside the body which translates sounds into elec-                 trical impulses transmitted directly to cochlear nerves via the                 electrodes, and the impulses are \"heard\" by the brain in a way                  which the wearer is able to interpret.  For people with certain                 kinds of deafness, cochlear implants have already provided                      significant enhancements in their ability to understand speech,                 most usually in conjunction with lip reading but sometimes even                 in the absence of visual cues.                                                                                                                                       The growing success of cochlear implantation presents                      interesting challenges to the science of speech perception, since               only a fraction of the information in the acoustical signal is                  actually translated into electrical impulses.  To the extent that               the user is able to interpret the impoverished signal accurately,               this shows that key perceptual information is included in it,                   thus affording a new perspective on the fundamental problem of                  speech perception:  what are the acoustic properties of speech                  which determine accurate perception?                                                                                                                                 This research project is a systematic exploration of the                   nature of the signal received by cochlear implantees, and their                 perception of it.  The research will focus on wearers of the                    newly developed \"Australian nucleus\" implant, which is a multi-                 channel device and carries much more information than earlier                   models.  The researcher will examine the speech perception of                   implantees, the changes in their speech patterns over time, and                 the reactions of normal listeners to speech signals distorted in                the ways which the implant device distorts them for its users.                  The principal research aim of the project is to identify the                    components of the distorted signal which enable correct percep-                 tion.  A successful outcome will be an important contribution to                speech science, as well as offering the possibility of further                  improvements in the design of cochlear implants.",
