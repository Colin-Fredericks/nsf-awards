 "awd_abstract_narration": "Potential problems with mechanical equipment are often revealed by              sound and vibration.  The acoustic signals therefrom are often used             to diagnose defects and monitor the performance of the equipment.               The technology is not fully developed and can benefit from further              study.  There are economic incentives to perfect such diagnostic                systems since they promise to provide the capability of rapid                   inspection of large machines or structures with minimal interruption            of operations.  Improving the sensitivity of such systems and                   minimizing their potential for false alarms would represent a major             step in advancing the technology.  This project addresses that goal.            It could lead to new ways of processing acoustic signals in order to            extract the maximum amount of useful information.  The beam is chosen           as the object of study because it is a basic structural component and           because there is an extensive theoretical literature on its                     vibrational modes, including the effect of cracks.  There is a                  variety of uncertainties in the condition of beams in service which             can cause variations in their acoustic signatures.  These                       uncertainties may arise from manufacturing variations in dimensions             and materials, wear, miscellaneous nicks and dents, small                       delaminations, corrosion, dirt or internal stress.  If changes in the           acoustic signatures of the beam caused by these harmless effects are            great enough, they may be the cause of false alarms in a detection              system.  This project's goal is to be able                                      to predict the extent of such effects and to compare them with                  the effects of flaws of serious concern.  The research program                  concentrates on the modeling of unflawed vibrating beams and the                construction of an experimental fixture for laboratory data                     acquisition.  The system modeling effort focuses on the                         prediction of the response of unflawed beams, the prediction of                 the response of cracked beams, and the preliminary prediction of                the effects of various other conditions specified above.  The                   experimental fixture activity focuses on the design of a test                   fixture, its fabrication and assembly, data acquisition from                    unflawed beams, data acquisition from flawed beams, data                        acquisition from beams of uncertain condition, and comparison of                signals from these experiments.",
