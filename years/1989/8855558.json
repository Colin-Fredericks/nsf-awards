Sixteen                               participants will be selected for each of the two workshops                     the first year, with twenty each in years two and three.  In                    each year, the first two-week workshop will focus on an in-                     depth understanding of basic chemical principles, the role of                   the laboratory and problem solving; the second workshop in                      each year will specialize in organic chemistry and                              biochemistry.  Throughout the sessions, strong emphasis will                    be placed on performing and directing hands-on laboratory                       work, deepening subject-matter knowledge, developing                            effective teaching skills, and bridging classroom chemistry                     with research and industry.  The latter will be accomplished                    by selected site visits to chemical research and industrial                     facilities located in the area as well as campus                                presentations by local visiting scientists.  Several master                     teachers of high school chemistry will serve as consultants                     to model successful practices.  Workshop and seminar sessions                   on eight Saturdays during each ensuing school year are                          planned to provide continued assistance, support, motivation,                   and a networking scheme to the participants.",
