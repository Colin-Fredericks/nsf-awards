 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. George H. Miley,                     Professor of Nuclear and Electrical Engineering, University                     of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, to pursue with Dr. Gwi Tae                     Park, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, Korea                      University, Seoul, Korea, for a period of 24 months, a                          program of research on the development of digital computer                      control techniques for use in pressurized water reactor                         nuclear power plants.  An adaptive control technique using a                    self-tuning method is sought for the load-following                             control.  A new algorithm of a self-tuning control is to be                     developed for this purpose by combining a pole-assignment                       method with a reference concept.  Simulation studies will be                    performed to evaluate this control system using an analog                       mock-up of an operating plant.                                                                                                                                  Because of low fuel costs, nuclear power plants usually are                     run at full power at all times while more expensive plants                      are operated to handle the daily load cycling.  The larger                      the fraction of nuclear generation in a power system,                           however, the more necessary it is for the nuclear units to                      be able to respond quickly to load changes to balance the                       power load of a network.  In this project, the collaborators                    will study the application of a new self-tuning digital                         computer control method for holding the average coolant                         temperature in nuclear reactors as close as possible to a                       desired but changing reference value in a load-following                        mode.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                        U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to                           increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean                       scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific                     information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  The U.S. and                      Korean collaborators are highly respected scientists with                       extensive research experience and productive publication                        records in the field of the proposal.  They have                                collaborated successfully in the past.",
