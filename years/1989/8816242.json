 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the continuation of a study to determine the nature and                 causes of compositional variation in lavas from the eruption of                 Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii which has been going on since 1983.                     Mineral and whole-rock compositions will be determined uand used                to evaluate the relative importance of crystal fractionation,                   magma mixing and mantle melting in controlling the composition of               the lavas erupted.  Lavas collected from the active lava lake 19                km. from the summit of the volcano seem to have a cyclic                        variation in composition that correlates well (with a time delay)               with summit tilt variations.  The continued monitoring of this                  variation will provide the first direct measurement of the rate                 of movement of magma in the rift zone.  It is also planned to                   evaluate the temporal and spatial variations in the composition                 of lavas erupted historically at the summit of Kilauea Volcano.                 This should make clearer the size and location of the summit                    reservoir which is still poorly known.                                          The petrological and geochemical results from this study will be                integrated with field and geophysical measurements and                          interpretations by the staff of the USGS Hawaiian Volcano                       Observatory.  This collaboration should yield new insights that                 will have fundamental implications for understanding the plumbing               system of Kilauea Volcano and for interpreting petrologic                       processes in volcanic systems.",
