 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four topics in this continuing investigation into the                      geometry and potential theory of Riemann surfaces will be covered               by this project.  The first of these concerns compact Riemann                   surfaces, combining Riemannian geometry, conformal geometry and                 algebraic geometry.  The interplay between these concepts is                    strongest when the surface is considered with the Arakelov metric               attached.  In terms of this metric a Green's function is                        determined.  One object of this research is to study the behavior               of the Green's function for a degenerating family of surfaces.                       Recently, a parametrization mapping of holomorphic quadratic               differentials on a surface with a hyperbolic metric has been                    constructed with range in the genus g Teichmuller space.  It is                 known to be real analytic.  Work will now proceed to extend this                parametrization to the case where the surface is replaced by a                  noded Riemann surface.  The object is to examine further the                    degeneration of hyperbolic metrics as well as the degeneration of               harmonic maps.                                                                       Further work on Teichmuller space centers on finding a                     boundary for the space and a kernel function (of two variables)                 which transforms by the diagonal action of the mapping class                    group.  In addition, it has been noted that the degeneration of                 the spectrum for hyperbolic Laplace-Beltrami operators leads to                 improved understanding of the degeneration of the hyperbolic                    metric.  Although the spectrum of the limit is not the limit of                 the spectrum, the possibility of obtaining one from the other is                to be investigated.  Of special interest will be the formation of               continuous spectrum and the analysis of discrete spectrum in the                limit.                                                                               Some of this work relates to earlier studies on string                     theory - further applications will be considered as the research                progresses.",
