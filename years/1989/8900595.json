 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taylor's investigations will all be in the area of                         combinatorial set theory, but the questions to be considered                    have rather different inspirations.  That is, those of the                      first group to be discussed arise from what one thinks of as                    traditional infinitary combinatorics, while those of the second                 group arise from the subarea of mathematical political science                  launched into prominence by the Nobel Prize winning work of                     Kenneth Arrow.                                                                       The considerations within traditional infinitary                           combinatorics will begin with a specific question about                         definable graphs on the real line.  The result it is hoped to                   establish for all Borel sets has been shown to hold for closed                  sets by M. Foreman and the investigator; the desired extension                  would provide a simultaneous generalization of two elegant                      known results.  The more general investigations will be in the                  area of partition theory and primarily involve some hoped for                   extensions of recent joint work with A. Blass and P. Erdos.                          Arrow's Impossibility Theorem can be regarded as an                        elegant characterization of the ultraproduct construction                       applied to linear (or pre-linear) orderings.  (Since                            ultrafilters on a finite set are principal, this yields the                     \"dictator\" one associates with Arrow's theorem).  The instant                   investigations in social choice theory will focus on the                        investigator's recent work generalizing Arrow's theorem in both                 the finite context and that of ultra-products.",
