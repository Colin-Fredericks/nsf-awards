 "awd_abstract_narration": "To systematically investigate the existence of strain                           gradients in pseudomorphic InGaAs grown on GaAs using                           molecular beam epitaxy (MB).  It is possible to                                 simultaneously lattice-match InA1As with InGaAs and                             energy-match InA1As with A1GaAs.  This permits a test                           structure where the bandgap discontinuity is independent                        of the strained interface.  In the first experiment,                            several InGaAs/InA1As/GaAs single quantum well structures                       will be grown using MBE.  The location of the quantum                           well within the strained region will be varied such                             that the quantum well serves as a probe to measure the                          strain.   Several sets of samples will be grown with                            different thicknesses of the strained layer.  The second                        experiment duplicates the first except the strained                             region will be kept substantially below the minimum                             critical thickness.  This permits all of the test                               structures to be grown in the same sample for comparison                        purposes.  After growth, the strain will be measured by                         using photoluminescence to detect strain-induced band                           shifts.  If the hypothesis of strain gradients in                               pseudomorphic InGaAs material is confirmed, then this                           project will have significant impact on the design and                          fabrication of pseudomorphic MODFET (HEMT) devices.",
