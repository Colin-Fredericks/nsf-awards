 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of                  Professors James Carlson and Domingo Toledo of the University of                Utah. Their work is in Hodge theory, and their aim is to attack                 the problem of classifying harmonic mappings from compact Kaehler               manifolds to locally symmetric spaces of noncompact type, with                  particular attention to rigidity and factorization theorems.                         This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and               Topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical Computer Science and in Robotics.",
