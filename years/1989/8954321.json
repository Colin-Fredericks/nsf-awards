 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Short Course on Dinosaurs is being offered at the 1989 Annual                 Meeting of the Geological Society of America.  Fifteen experts on               various aspects of the Age of Dinosaurs are presenting a cohesive               summary of new research in the evolution, origin, phylogeny,                    adaptations, environments, and extinctions of dinosaurs and some of the         plants and animals with which they lived.  The Short Course is designed         for non-specialists in dinosaurs to provide broad coverage and                  attention to new ideas and findings.  Special emphasis is being given           to how to set up and teach a course on dinosaurs to undergraduate               students.  Courses on dinosaurs have already proven to be great                 motivating tools that stimulate students to learn more about earth and          life sciences.  Dinosaurs can also be used as a vehicle to communicate          ideas on subjects as diverse as molecular biology and geophysics.               Short Course notes prepared from the lectures are being distributed at          cost.                                                                                                                                                           NSF is funding the travel costs for the speakers with the balance of            the costs covered by sponsoring societies.",
