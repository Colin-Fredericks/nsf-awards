 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal for the participation of five U.S. scientists in an               international workshop in the natural sciences and their methodology            to be held in Lima, Peru, August 10-18 1989, is sponsored by NSF                as part of the Science in Developing Countries Program, in                      conjunction with Queens College of CUNY, and the Peruvian National              Council for Science and Technology (CONCYTEC-Peru).  Funding for                participants from other countries is coming from ICSU/UNESCO and a              variety of international and national research organizations and                universities.                                                                                                                                                   This multiple discipline workshop in selected topic in physics,                 biology, and the foundations of science, aims at stimulating new                professional contacts among scientists from the US, Peru, and                   other countries who share common research interests.  Peruvian                  participants will be selected with the help of CONCYTEC-Peru.  The              object is to provide Peruvian faculty with an up-dated picture of               today's increasingly inter-connected scientific view of the                     natural world, with emphasis on improved approaches to the                      teaching of general courses at the college level mathematics and                the natural sciences. Sciences to be covered include; biology;                  biochemistry; physics; evolutionary studies; science education;                 mathematics; behavioral studies; artificial intelligence; astronomy;            and philosophy and history of science.",
