Chen, Yale University as the U.S. workshop co-chair               and with Dr. Ron Pinter, IBM Israel Scientific Center, the Israeli              co-chair.  The workshop to be held in 1990, probably in October in              Jerusalem, will focus on advanced compilation techniques in at least            four major areas of compilation techniques in novel computer                    architectures.  Attendees will give or provide papers during the                workshop.  These papers along with workshop discussions will be                 published as a book through separate arrangements, made outside the             scope of this proposal, with the publishers, Springer-Verlag.  The              co-chairs and a publisher editor will edit the publication, which               should be available by late Spring 1991 to the U.S. and Israeli                 science communitities.                                                                                                                                          Scope:  This proposal will continue a series of workshops convened              to consider areas of mutual scientific interest to the Foundation               and the Israeli NCRD.  The subject of this workshop is important to             the U.S. as it is necessary for this country to remain competitive              in the world of supercomputing.  Compiler technologies are deemed               crucial to the effective use of new generations of supercomputers.              The Israeli parallel computing community, while small, is growing               and has made several interesting contributions to the field, both in            theory and in practice.  This workshop has the possibilities to                 foster some important exchanges of scientific knowledge in computer             science that could benefit each country and also to provide                     international science a new source of publication reference",
