 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the interactions of moose with the                 dynamics of plant populations, their feedbacks with carbon and                  nitrogen cycles, and subsequent changes in boreal landscapes. The               main hypothesis is that moose promote patchiness of vegetation in               boreal forests.  This patchiness results from alternation of                    species composition by selective, non-random foraging patterns                  across the landscape; different responses of species to browsing;               differential establishment of plants in browsed patches; and                    changes in nutrient cycles caused by these changes in vegetation.               The project will quantify moose interactions at soil, feeding                   station, habitat, and landscape scales in several valleys on Isle               Royale National Park, Michigan.  These valleys have different                   disturbance regimes and different assemblages of plant species.                 Field studies will determine spatial correspondences of foraging,               the distribution of food and cover, browse quality, plant seed                  and litter dispersal, plant establishment, and soil nitrogen                    availability.  These data will be assembled in a geographic                     information system that will be coupled with a forest simulation                model.  Computer studies will address how foraging strategies                   cause development of different spatial patterns of vegetation and               soils, and how spatial variability in habitat influences moose                  population dynamics.                                                                 The Investigators are well qualified to do the type of                     research and the University facilities are more than adequate.",
