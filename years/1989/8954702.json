 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference for urban science educators will bring                          together science leaders in cities across the country to                        discuss problems and issues related to their elementary                         science programs and to share solutions and strategies for                      successful programs.  A working team consisting of a science                    supervisor, a representative elementary teacher, and a                          principal from each of 20 selected cities will attend.  The                     intent is to begin an on-going dialogue that will continue                      between these sites and continue to influence new cities.                       The focus of the conference will be on concepts, pedagogy,                      and assessment--what concepts should be taught; what pedagogy                   works with urban children; what are good assessment                             strategies and how can they trigger changes in teacher                          behavior; and what training and professional development                        efforts work and should be implemented.",
