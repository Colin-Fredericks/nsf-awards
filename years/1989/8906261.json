 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to comprehensively study                  the metagabbroic rocks drilled from the Atlantis II fracture zone               on Southwest Indian Ridge during Leg 118 of the Ocean Drilling                  Program.  The drill core represents of nearly 500 meters of                     gabbro with 87% recovery.  Work will include detailed petrography               and electron microprobe studies of secondary minerals and vein                  assemblages, stable isotope studies and  fluid inclusion studies.               The goal is to understand the metamorphic history of the rocks                  and to determine the mass fluxes of various types of metamorphic                fluids that have given rise to different phases of alteration.                  %%%                                                                                  This project represents the first attempt to characterize                  the metamorphic and tectonic history of rocks from layer three of               the oceanic crust that have been obtained by drilling.  This is a               unique sample suite.  This project should produce a new                         understanding of the nature and evolution of the deeper parts of                the oceanic crust.  This project complements work to be done on                 primary mineral assemblages and bulk chemistry on the same core                 by other investigators.",
