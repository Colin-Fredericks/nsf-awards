 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science Enrichment for Nebraska Talented Rural Youth, 1989                      (SENTRY '89) is a two-week summer residential program at Nebraska               Wesleyan University for Nebraska high school students from small                rural high schools.  The forty participants will include                        approximately ten Native Americans from the three Nebraska                      reservations and twenty women.  The academic portion of the                     project is made up of laboratory-based experiences in biology,                  chemistry, physics, and computer science.  Evenings will be                     devoted to presentations and discussions of career possibilities                in science related occupations.  At the end of the project, the                 participants will present the results of their academic and other               work to their high school science teachers and                                  principals/superintendents of schools at a banquet-                             reports session.  During the succeeding academic year, faculty                  members from Nebraska Wesleyan University will visit the high                   schools to consult with the high school teachers and the                        participants and to make a presentation (or conduct some other                  activity) in the participants' science classes.",
