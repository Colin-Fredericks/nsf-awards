 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference aims to train young scholars in the use of an                   important data set, the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and                     an innovative data analytic technique, event history                            analysis.  Large-scale longitudinal data sets like the Panel                    Study of Income Dynamics have been available since the early                    1970s, but they have not been fully exploited for dynamic                       analyses of changes over time.  One technique for such                          dynamic analysis is event-history analysis, the name given to                   a set of methods for analyzing data on the dates of events,                     such as changes in employment or marital status, the                            composition of a household, or its poverty status.  This                        conference has two components:  a three-day workshop in which                   15 young scholars will receive training in both the event                       history methodology and the use of the PSID data, and, 20                       months later, a conference at which completed papers by these                   young investigators can be presented and critiqued.  This                       workshop/conference format is especially valuable in training                   young scholars and in encouraging an earlier, higher return                     on investments in the PSID event-history data funded by the                     National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.",
