 "awd_abstract_narration": "New frontiers have been broken within the past years in our                     understanding of the upper mantle through theoretical and applied               geophysical and geochemical programs.  While the structure and                  composition of the upper mantle remain topics of debate, and                    whereas a considerable gap continues to exist between geophysical               and geochemical models, discrepancies for the subcontinental,                   subcratonic upper mantle are approaching consensus, mainly                      because models can be geochemically constrained by direct                       measurements of upper mantle-derived xenolith suites.  Five                     research topics are identified that will further constrain the                  mineralogy, petrology and geochemistry of the upper mantle,                     including source regions and repositories for large-ion-                        lithophile-elements relevant to the geochemical modelling of                    alkali and basaltic magmas in the upper mantle.  The emphasis is                the titanate minerals and associated silicates of metasomatic                   origin, and of eclogites and diamonds that have evolved in upper                mantle metasomes.  Regional lithospheric metasomatism and exotic                titanates are recognized in Africa, China, Venezuela, Siberia and               Australia.  With the seminal discoveries of titanates as diamond                inclusions, and of LILE in coated diamonds, revised models for                  the genesis of diamond are required.  Principal techniques to be                employed in this study are optical and SEM microscopy, electron                 and ion-probe, and XRF analyses.  The results will provide an                   improved definition of the subcratonic lithosphere,                             mineralogically, petrologically and geochemically.//",
