 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John S. Dahler is supported by a grant from The                       Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop a                    theory of laser-induced collision processes.  Experimental                      studies have demonstrated the fact that reactions which occur                   in colliding molecular beams are influenced by the presence of                  laser fields to the extent that laser-induced association                       depends on the polarization of the laser light.  This research                  has a potential long term impact in furthering our                              understanding of laser-induced chemistry.                                                                                                                       Dahler will develop theories to explain experimental                            observations in the following areas: 1) field free associative                  and Penning ionization which occurs in molecular beam collision                 experiments; 2) the effects of polarization on chemi-ionization                 and laser-induced excitation transfer processes; and 3) the                     characteristics of transiently populated quasi-molecular states                 produced during laser-induced collisional processes.   Dahler                   will also develop the necessary numerical and computational                     methods to perform computer simulations in support of these                     theoretical developments.",
