 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will be supported jointly by the Biophysics                        Program and the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                      Chemistry Program. The focus of the project is the exploitation                 in chemistry and biophysics of the information about individual                 metal environments in solution which can be obtained from the                   luminescence which occurs as a result of laser excitation of                    the lanthanide metal ions terbium(III) and europium(III).                       Imporant biological information, such as the distances between                  calcium ion binding sites in blood proteins, can be obtained                    from studies of the luminescence of these lanthanide ions when                  they are substituted for the native metal ions.                                                                                                                 Laser-excited lanthanide ion luminescence techniques will be                    developed further to determine the extent to which measured                     parameters of the luminescence (intensities, frequencies,                       lifetimes, splittings) can be used to obtain information about                  the number of distinct species present, the total charge on the                 ligands surrounding Eu(III), the site symmetry of the ion, the                  number of coordinated water molecules, energy transfer rates,                   and ligand exchange kinetics. Energy transfer between                           luminescent lanthanide ions and various freely-diffusing                        inorganic acceptor ions in solution will be investigated to                     provide an understanding of the mechanism of resonant energy                    transfer. The accessability of solvent to Ln(III) ions bound to                 macromolecules will be probed, and the use of Eu(III)                           luminescence as a probe of the interaction of DNA in its                        various conformations with metal ions will be assessed. The                     structure of t-RNA, its metal ion binding characteristics, and                  interactions with target molecules will be explored also using                  these methods. An investigation of model membrane systems                       (phospholipid bilayer vesicles) will establish the basic                        interactions of metal ions with these systems and allow the                     study ofionophore-mediated transport of metal ions. The basic                   coordination chemistry of Eu(III)-hydroxo species and several                   novel chelating agents with potential applications as                           ionophores, nmr imaging agents and immunoassay labels will be                   explored. A new class of macrocyclic ligand, crown sulfoxides,                  will be synthesized and complexation with Ln(III) ions explored.",
