 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides for the participation of 100 grade K-12 teachers          of earth, oceanographic, and atmospheric sciences in the Second                 International Conference on School and Meteorological Education.  The           three-day conference to be held in the Washington, DC, area in July             1989, is hosted and organized by the American Meteorological Society            (AMS), with the co-sponsorship of the Royal Meteorological Society (RMS)        and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).                                                                                                                Teachers targeted for selection are those who have demonstrated                 abilities to successfullly incorporate the study of meteorology and/or          oceanography into their classroom programs, and to communicate                  noteworthy practices to other teachers.  Participation in the Conference        will afford these leader-teachers the opportunity to interact with              teachers, researchers and other discipline professionals from all over          the world, including representatives from the ten international training        centers of the WMO.                                                                                                                                             The U.S. teachers will take part in workshops, poster sessions, invited         state-of-the art lecture presentations, \"hands-on\" laboratory                   activities, structured discussion sessions, as well as  informal                exchanges with a full cross-section of the attendees.  Participants will        produce written plans on how the content, materials, and techniques             presented at the Conference will be implemented in their classrooms and         in required in-service training sessions for other teachers.  Each              participant will receive copies of the Conference proceedings, which by         design will also serve as a teacher reference for integrating weather-          and ocean-related topics into the classroom.                                                                                                                    As a result of the conference, the participants will form a cadre of            leader-teachers in the atmospheric and oceanographic sciences to network        not only among themselves but to additionally link with the professional        organizations of practitioners in these fields.  The AMS is poised to           provide leadership from its members in this educational effort in which         the Conference is expected to serve as a catalyst.                                                                                                              SEE Directorate funding is entirely for direct participant support and          selection.  The GEO Directorate contribution to costs of advertising,           printing, and clerical assistance amounts to 14.5% of the total                 recommended grant.  No indirect costs are included in the grant; all            other administrative costs are borne by the AMS.",
