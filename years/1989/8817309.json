 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many interesting and new phenomena are predicted to occur for a                 three dimensional electron gas where scattering by the background               of point charges is absent.  Strong magnetic fields in the                      quantum limit are predicted to induce collective charge- or spin-               density wave states with novel transport properties analogous to                the quantum Hall effect.  With their collaborator, A.C. Gossard,                they have developed means of producing spatially uniform layers                 of elctron gas using wide remotely doped parabolic gallium                      arsenic/aluminumxgallium1-xarsenic wells, which can be thick                    enough to approach the three-dimensional limit.  The parabolic                  potential, created using parabolic grading of the average                       aluminum concentration, appears to the electrons as a spatially                 uniform positive background charge.  They propose to investigate                magnetotransport in strong magnetic fields at dilution                          refrigerator temperatures in order to study the changes which                   occur in the quantum Hall effect as the electron layer becomes                  thicker, and to search for new collective phenomena.  These                     heterostructures will be characterized using optical and far-                   infrared measurements of the quantum excitation spectra of                      electrons, as well as measurements of Shubnikov de Haas                         oscillations in the magnetoresistance.",
