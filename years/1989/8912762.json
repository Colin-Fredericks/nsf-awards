 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by Andrzej Rajca at Kansas State University within                 the Organic Dynamics Program, is aimed at the development of                    organic compounds with superconducting and ferromagnetic                        properties.  Very few examples are currently known, with such                   properties most often confined to inorganic solids.  The use of                 organics with metallic-like properties will provide a wealth of                 possibilities due to ease of fabrication and subsequent                         modification of properties by standard methods of organic                       synthesis.                                                                                                                                                      Because the electronic structure and bonding of molecules and                   solids is affected by topology (and symmetry), a topological                    approach to organic superconductors and ferromagnets will be                    employed.  Multi-carbanions, radicals, and radical anions of                    pi-conjugated hydrocarbons with highly degenerate highest                       occupied, non-bonding molecular orbitals will be prepared.  The                 degeneracy and unique delocalization of these orbitals have a                   topological rather than symmetry origin.  First, theoretical                    predictions about the impact of the special topology on the                     charge distribution, ground state multiplicities, and other                     molecular properties will be tested.  Second, solids will be                    prepared; density of states at the Fermi level, band width, and                 other important solid state properties will be obtained and                     compared to their molecular counterparts.  Finally, the solids                  will be examined with respect to ferromagnetism and                             superconductivity.",
