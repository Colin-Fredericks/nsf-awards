 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed ultra thin carbon fiber wire saw is a novel bonded             abrasive wire saw that utilizes the high tensile strength of carbon             fibers.  Although present highest tensile strength carbon fibers                exhibit only 575ksi, near term marketing of 750ksi fibers is                    expected.  Reports indicate laboratory results in the order of 1Msi.                The research plans call for the development of an abrasive                  sol-gel coating to be applied onto a carbon fiber which has been                impregnated and coated with a hard metal film.  Sol-gel processes               involve incorporation of silicon carbide surface modified abrasive              granules in high densities in a single crystal ingot of silicon based           sol-gel.  The wire is designed for monodirectional sawing (opposed to           reciprocating) and the sol-gel acts as a sacrificial host to the                abrasive particulate.  A systematic study of wire diameter between 50           and 150 microns will be conducted for various abrasive sizes (10, 25,           and 40 microns).  As a demonstration, a small diameter silicon ingot            will be sliced and the wafer as well as wire wear will be analyzed.             It is anticipated that the kerf losses will be reduced by a  factor             of 2.5 in the near future and about 3.3 in the long term.",
