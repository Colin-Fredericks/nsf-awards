 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering research equipment grant is to acquire                    three separate pieces of equipment, each of which is important to               the continued research progress of the Cornell Injection Molding                Program - an interdisciplinary research group in the Engineering                School at Cornell University which has received continuous NSF                  funding since 1974.  The acquisitions include (1) computer                      hardware for upgrading a heavily used computer facility in                      various areas related to the injection molding of thermoplastics                as well as thermosets, ceramic-filled polymers and semi-solid                   metal alloys; (2) a high-temperature/high-pressure capillary                    rheometer which will be used for establishing more accurate and                 reliable material-property data such as melt viscosity in support               of computer-simulation and process-control work; and (3) a                      tensile tester for plastic specimens which will be used for                     experimental verification of research aimed at development of                   predictive models for the load-deformation behavior of short-                   fiber-reinforced injection-molded parts.",
