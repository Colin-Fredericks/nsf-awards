Each subscriber receives a               personal response from a scientist for each submission.                                                                                                         The Museum of Science will expand this program to a national audience by        creating 12 scientific challenge packets, opening and supporting 20             chapters at science-technology centers around the country with                  materials, training and promotional materials, and by working with the          AAAS to recruit scientist-reviewers.  The museum will strengthen its            ties with other national organizations as well to recruit both                  subscribers and scientists.  Museum of Science cost sharing of $185,299         is 40% of total project cost.  An estimated 60,000 children will                participate in the program and subscription income should make \"Science-        by-Mail\" self-sufficient by its third year.",
