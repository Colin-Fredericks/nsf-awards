 "awd_abstract_narration": "In prior research on models of political party competition as it                affects policy formulation, researchers have assumed either that                parties seek to implement policy as close to a preferred position as            possible, or that they adopt policy positions in an attempt to maximize         their electoral support.  Prior theoretical work by the Principal               Investigator suggests that both considerations are relevant for party           competition in multiparty democracies.                                                                                                                          In this investigation the researchers will draw on recent theoretical           analyses using game theory and social choice as well as empirical work          on party policies to construct a general model of political competition         in multiparty democracies, principally in European countries.                   Coalition politics in such countries has proved very difficult to               analyze from a general theoretical perspective.  However, careful study         of the declared policy positions of parties in a number of these                countries (including Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Sweden,              Denmark) has provided a clearer picture of the process of inter-party           negotiation and bargaining and hence of government coalition formation          in these countries.                                                                                                                                             This research should provide insights that are of general validity on           the process of policy implementation and on the stability of the                political process.",
