The program is a 10-week summer research                  program designed to enlarge the very small numbers of blacks                    entering the field of experimental psychology.  Ten students                    between their junior and senior years will be enrolled.  At least               five students will be from colleges with substantial black                      undergraduate enrollments.                                                                                                                                      Students will be assigned to laboratories in which they will help               design, carry out and analyze the results of a research project,                under the supervision of a regular full-time member in the                      Syracuse Psychology Department.  Students will make both oral                   presentations and written  reports of their projects.  Advisors                 will evaluate reports through written comments sent to the                      students after the end of the program.                                                                                                                          Students will evaluate the program by completing forms                          distributed at the middle and end of the summer.  Information                   about actual career choices and the impact of the summer program                on those choices, will be solicited from students, home                         departments and advisors at the end of the academic year                        following the program.",
