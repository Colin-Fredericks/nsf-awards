 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than 200 economically important plant diseases are                    caused by \"mycoplasma-like organisms\" (MLOs).  These diseases                   affect a wide range of vegetable and fruit crops, including                     celery, carrots, lettuce, cherries, peaches and blueberries,                    causing symptoms ranging from severe yellowing to \"witch's broom\"               to stunting and fruit loss.  Up until 20 years ago, MLO-diseases                were thought to be due to plant viruses, since they caused some                 of the symptoms of viruses, and were transmitted by insects, as                 are many viruses.  However, electron microscopy revealed that                   these diseases were caused by the presence of cell wall-less                    bacteria in the plant vascular system.  Because of their small                  size, pleiomorphic structure, and lack of cell walls, these                     organisms resemble bacterial mycoplasmas, which are animal                      pathogens, and hence they have been referred to as \"mycoplasma-                 like organisms\".                                                                     MLOs become systemic in plants, and thus, they are able to                 survive over the winter in roots of infected cherry trees,                      blueberry bushes, or other perennials.  As a result, an infected                perennial plant will have chronic disease symptoms until it dies                of the disease or is removed and destroyed.  The only effective                 treatment is injection with tetracycline, but even that                         antibiotic causes just a remission of symptoms, without                         eliminating the MLO.  Development of improved procedures for                    prevention and treatment of MLO disease would be assisted                       significantly by a better understanding of the disease agent.                        This proposal is designed to examine aspects of the                        physiology and membrane biology of a plant pathogenic MLO.  This                will provide a better understanding of the organism, including                  whether it shares traits of the mycoplasmas that are animal                     pathogens.  Attempts will be made to grow the plant MLO on an                   artificial medium.  If an MLO culture can be established, the                   nutritional requirements of the organism and its antibiotic                     sensitivities could be more thoroughly assessed.  This would                    contribute significantly to our ability to manage and treat                     diseases caused by this widespread plant pathogen.",
