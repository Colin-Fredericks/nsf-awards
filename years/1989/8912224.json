 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marble, a nontraditional cladding material for high-rise                        structures, has been treated primarily as a design issue by                     architects.  During recent years, improvements in the cutting                   process have allowed the thickness of the cladding panels to                    decrease markedly.  This has led to a dramatic increase in the                  use of this form of cladding.  It has also led to recent nation-                wide problems with marble cladding on buildings that are no more                than twenty years old.  The observed problems of the marble                     cladding include severe and permanent bowing of the material that               starts soon after the buildings are completed, and the eventual                 failure of some of all anchorages of the cladding to the                        building.  In addition to disastrous economic consequences for                  the building owners and the marble and curtain wall industries,                 there are potential risks to life associated with high-rise                     construction that may be dangerously increased in the future.                                                                                                   There is a controversy among experts about the cause of the                     permanent bowing and the effect of the restraints provided by the               anchorages.  This research will investigate the alleged causes of               permanent deformation, thru-thickness temperature differentials                 and moisture.  The results of the research will include                         recommendations for building code specifications for an                         engineered solution to the marble cladding reliability problem,                 as well as the development of an ASTM Standard for Subcommittee                 E6.55 on the Performance of Exterior Building Wall Systems.",
