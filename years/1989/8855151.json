The students will be advised                   by l2 mathematically experienced counselors and l0 faculty.                                                                                                     The heart of the program is the experience gained by students                   through their efforts to solve problems in Number Theory and                    Algebra.  To assist them in these efforts, the program                          provides several sources of aid (beyond the daily lecture).                     Five problem sessions, directed by senior mathematicians,                       will meet three times per week in groups of about l0                            students.  Each student will be supervised by a counselor in                    residence who is always available to answer questions.  The                     coursework will be supplemented by diverse weekly lectures by                   faculty preceptors.  Students will be assigned a faculty                        preceptor who will be on hand to offer career guidance and                      mathematical stimulation throughout the summer.",
