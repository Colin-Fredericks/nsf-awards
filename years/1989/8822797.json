 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines an approach to developing a comprehensive                modeling language and supporting computer environment that will                 permit managers and others with limited experience to build and                 use decision models.  This is clearly an ambitious undertaking,                 but reviewers of the proposal expressed confidence in the                       principal investigator and in his ability to make significant                   progress on the topic.  The proposed effort would extend earlier                work of the investigator by developing a set of educational tools               that will introduce users to structured modeling approaches.                    These tools then will be tested on small groups of users and the                results of these experiments will form an empirical basis for                   evaluating a prototype modeling environment.  This direct                       involvement of user groups is considered to be critical to                      determining the usefulness of structured modeling approaches and                their feasibility as an assessible tool for developing decision                 models.  The results of this project are expected to add                        significantly to the understanding of structured modeling                       environments and to what is known regarding how rapidly and how                 extensively structured modeling is likely to be adopted by                      managers as a decision.aiding tool.",
