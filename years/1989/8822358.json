 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal develops a new approach to the study of strategic                 decision making among firms over time.  Decisions made by firms                 with respect to repositioning themselves vis.a.vis other firms                  are important in understanding the behavior of organizations but,               to date, have been studied very little in terms of a dynamic                    process that is induced by stress but made difficult for reasons                of organizational inertia.  This proposal will develop a dynamic                model of the strategic decision.making process typically employed               by firms, focusing not on any single dimension of the search                    process (e.g., the spatial aspects of search behavior) but on a                 broad set of concerns that include organizational, cognitive, and               political factors.  The project is believed likely to make a                    contribution to the study of organizational behavior and                        includes an empirical analysis, involving a longitudinal study of               strategic mobility decisions within two industrial sectors, that                is considered to be both appropriate and original.  The study                   will furthermore compare the empirical model to an existing data                base, developed from a study of the pharmaceutical industry, and                to alternative models of strategic change.  The principal                       investigators on the project are highly qualified and well able                 to explore both the theoretical and applied lessons of the                      project.",
