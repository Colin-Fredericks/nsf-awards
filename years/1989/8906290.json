 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will investigate the effects of insect               herbivory on rates and patterns of species replacement during                   primary plant succession  on sand dunes.  The research will focus               on a specialist beetle, Altica bimarginata, and the willow, Salix               cordata.  An integrated set of field and greenhouse experiments                 will examine both the effects of plant successional stage on                    rates of herbivory and effects of herbivores on plant                           successional processess, as well as provide critical tests of the               underlying mechanisms.                                                               To study how herbivore abundance varies between and within                 plant successional stages, field experiments will examine how                   attributes of host plants and the surrounding plant community                   influence herbivory.  The role of genetic differences between                   plants in influencing rates of herbivory will be addressed with a               reciprocal transplant study.  Herbivore exclusion experiments                   will examine the role of herbivory in influencing plant                         successional patterns.  The importance of surrounding plant                     neighbors in influencing succession and how herbivores affect                   succession will be studied with plant neighbor removal                          experiments.  Greenhouse  experiments varying the level of                      herbivory will examine what aspects of host plant fitness are                   affected by herbivory.                                                               Although herbivory is known to strongly affect plant fitness               and competitive interactions, the role of herbivory in                          influencing plant succession has been largely ignored.  By                      focusing on both the effects of plants on insects and the effects               of insects on plants, the interactive nature of insect-plant                    dynamics in successional systems will be elucidated.  These                     contributions are of central importance to insect and plant                     ecology, as well as understanding of communities and factors                    controlling species diversity.",
