 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research effort is concerned with several topics of                   current interest in applied mathematics, especially those                       associated with nonlinear phenomena in continuum mechanics.                     Emphasis is placed on both the physical phenomena and the                       mathematical theories used to describe nonlinear wave and                       stability characteristics in hydrodynamics.                                          Specifically, a systematic study will be made of a new                     theoretical approach to nonlinear stability.  This development                  emphasizes the importance of mean flow/first harmonic                           interactions, rather than the more usual ones that involve the                  generation of higher harmonics, as the driving mechanism                        underlying the evolution of 3-D disturbances in shear flows.                    Some special cases have already been considered and it is                       believed that this approach could have important consequences                   to a broad range of instability problems.  The PI intends to                    consider a number of further applications so that the range of                  its applicability can be fully assessed.",
