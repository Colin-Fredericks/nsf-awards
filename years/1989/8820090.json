 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction between surface                                             evaporation/evapotranspiration and atmospheric boundary layer                   processes constitutes a research area of considerable interest                  and need for both atmospheric and water management disciplines.                 For example, the World Climate Research Program emphasizes the                  urgency of extensive observational work in this area and it is                  recognized that such information is an important next step in                   improving climate models.                                                           One of the most carefully conducted field programs ever                     attempted to study surface moisture fluxes in complex terrain,                  known as the Hydrological and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment                      (HAPEX), was completed in the Spring and Summer of 1986.  The                   Principal Investigator participated in the planning and execution               of this experiment.                                                                 The field phase of the HAPEX was very successful and the                    Principal Investigator will continue his analysis of this rich                  data set.  Aircraft and surface-based mesonetwork data will be                  used to examine the contributions of various physical mechanisms                (e.g. free and forced thermals, shear modified convection, cloud                controlled turbulence, surface inhomogeneity and local                          circulation) to boundary layer fluxes.  Different contributions                 to the flux will be related to such factors as the background                   synoptic conditions and overall atmospheric stability.",
