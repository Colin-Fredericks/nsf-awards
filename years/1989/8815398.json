 "awd_abstract_narration": "Site selective laser spectroscopy will be used to measure the                   concentrations of different defect centers as changes are induced               in the crystal defect distribution by different environmental                   perturbations.  Three parts are proposed in the program.  The                   activity coefficients that describe the nonidealities of defect                 equilibria in calcium fluoride and lead fluoride will be measured               for different ionic strengths and ionic radii of the dopants by                 measuring the ratio of site concentrations at high dopant levels                where nonideality effects dominate and at low concentrations                    where the effects are negligible.  The kinetics of defect                       aggregation will be measured in calcium fluoride by following the               changes that occur in the relative number of defect clusters as a               function of the annealing time, temperature, and dopant levels.                 The experiments will identify the number of dopant ions that make               up the individual clusters and the thermodynamic parameters that                control the mobility associated with the aggregation.  Finally,                 we will use the same methods that have been employed in the                     previous work on binary compounds to study the more complex                     defect chemistry of ternary perovskite compounds.  They will                    probe ions at both cation sites in the perovskites so there will                be direct monitors of all the intrinsic defects.  The                           concentrations of the different defects will be measured over the               range of different conditions that affect the perovskites and                   related to microscopic pictures of the defect equilibria that are               responsible for the distributions.",
