 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work in deep-sea, soft-substratum communities                       suggests that species' abundances are strongly affected by                      processes at centimeter-to-millimeter scales and that many of                   these processes are governed by biologically produced                           structures (e.g., animal tubes).  However, no mechanistic                       understanding of the role of such structures in deep-sea                        community dynamics has been obtained.  Dr. Eckman and                           collaborator Dr. Thistle are evaluating mechanisms by which the                 2-cm-diameter sediment concretions built by polychaetes affect                  harpacticoid copepod abundances in the San Diego Trough.  In                    particular, their efforts will be focused on testing responses                  to fluid- and particle-dynamic effects of sediment concretions.                 They have used the submersible ALVIN to sample individual                       sediment concretions and bare areas of the sea floor and to                     initiate in situ experiments.  They will complete analysis of                   samples, which were obtained in previous cruises.  The analysis                 of these samples will enable the determination the importance                   of hydrodynamic and predation-refuge effects created by these                   structures.  The former, in particular, are likely to be                        especially important in the deep ocean, because of the                          relatively low rates of physical disruption of sediments there.                 Further, sediment concretions are comparable in size to other                   widespread, deep-sea structures (e.g., ferromanganese nodules).                 generalizable.",
