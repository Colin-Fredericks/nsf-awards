 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the fundamental pigment patterns seen among most vertebrate              species including mammals is one wherein the back is darkly colored             while the belly is whitish.  Generally speaking, dark pigmentation              among vertebrate species is brought about by the action of melanocyte-          stimulating hormone (MSH) produced by and released from the                     intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland.  This hormone stimulates the          expression of melanin-containing pigment cells (melanophores,  -cytes)          and inhibits the whitish pigment cells (iridophores) on the back.  It           has been shown recently that the white belly pattern of frogs is partly         due to the absence of melanin pigment in the belly skin because                 melanophores in this region are inhibited by the localized presence of          a melanization inhibiting factor (MIF) present in belly skin.  This MIF         from frogs inhibits melanization of mouse melanoma cells in cell                culture and a similar acting MIF from the pale belly skin of a                  pigmented mouse inhibits melanization of frog melanophores.  This lends         credence to the concept that an MIF or a family of MIF molecules is             responsible for normal pigment pattern formation among all vertebrates.                                                                                         The proposed investigation is directed toward understanding the                 interaction between MSH and the putative MIF in the establishment of            vertebrate pigment patterns.  Most of the work will study the effects           of these protein molecules in pigment cell cultures.  A third little            known factor, serum melanization factor (SMF), will also be involved in         these experiments.  The interactions among all three will be assessed.          The basic knowledge to be derived from this study will have practical           implications beyond that of \"knowledge for its own sake.\"  For example,         the localized elaboration of MIF molecules could explain the greying of         hair or the blanching of skin as in human vitiligo.  Possible                   implications of MIF in diagnosis and treatment of human malignant               melanoma are also possible.",
