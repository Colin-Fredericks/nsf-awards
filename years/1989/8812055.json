 "awd_abstract_narration": "The productivity of pelagic Sargassum may not be nutrient                  limited at those times when the macroalga drifts into neritic                   waters.  Preliminary observations suggest that episodic                         enrichment resulting from associated fish schools may account for               a large fraction of nutrient availability to Sargassum in neritic               waters.  This work will: 1) Quantify the abundance of fish                      schools and their relative importance as a nutrient source to                   Sargassum in neritic versus oceanic waters.  2) Characterize the                organic nutrient pools associated with dissolved excretion and                  defecation by fish schools.  3) Characterize short term                         physiological and biochemical responses of Sargassum to N and P                 enrichment typical of that resulting from fish excretion and                    defecation.  These studies will determine for the first time the                potential importance of fish excretion to nutrient supply of a                  macroalgal community.                                                                Typically, plant growth in offshore waters is dominated by                 microscopic plants suspended in the surface sunlit layer.                       However, a floating seaweed called Sargassum is common throughout               the area off the southeast coast of the United States.  In the                  proposed work, Lapointe seeks to answer questions regarding the                 large scale (basin) distribution of this unusual plankton form.                 He will examine the hypothesis that the circulation of Sargassum                through nearshore water is a critical stage during which                        nutrients from schooling fish relieve the nutrient depleted                     conditions that the plants encounter in more offshore waters.                   This is a unique \"ecophysiological\" approach that blends research               in the biology of macroalgae with research in large scale                       oceanographic conditions.  Dr. Lapointe is a recognized expert in               the nutrition of seaweeds and this work will help clarify the                   plant production ecology of Atlantic subtropical regions.",
