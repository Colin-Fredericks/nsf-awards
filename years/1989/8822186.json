The                        discussion of building an international network is of high                      interest to the NSFNET program and it is important that the                     program be well represented at the Workshop.                                         The Academic Network Workshop will bring together key                      individuals from countries around the world who are involved in                 designing, implementing, or funding networking facilities on a                  national or international scale for the academic community.  It                 provides a forum for information exchange concerning national and               international networking projects.  Attendees represent over 30                 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, Australia, New Zealand,               and South America.                                                                   The Academic Network Workshop will take place immediatiely                 before the 9th International Conference on Computer Communication               which will be held in Tel Aviv, Israel, from October 30 to                      November 4.
