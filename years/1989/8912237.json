 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subsequent to the early conferences, remarkable advances in                     molecular biology have opened new opportunities for enzyme                      technology, and today there is an even greater interest in the                  use of enzymes for therapeutic, analytical and chemical                         production purposes.  The program of the 9th Enzyme                             Engineering Conference thus focused on the recent advances in                   enzyme structure research, on site-directed mutagenesis for                     alteration of enzyme structure and activity, on immobilization                  techniques for both enzymes and whole cells, affinity                           chromatography, transport effects in reactors, and enzyme                       production and purification.  The 9th Conference was                            considerably more focused on developments in the life                           sciences, in anticipation of subsequent engineering                             applications.  The 10th Conference continues this general                       approach; however, it will incorporate additional sections on                   engineering applications.                                                                                                                                       This conference is scheduled to be held at Kashikojima, Japan,                  on September 24-29, 1989.  Funds are to help support U.S.                       participant                                                                     expenses.",
