 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, submitted to the National Science Foundation Directorate         for Computer Information and Science Engineering, involves the                  development and execution of a workshop for very large scale integrated         (VLSI)circuit design.  The focus of the workshop is directed towards            minority academic institutions-namely HBCU's -obtaining the skills              necessary to teach and conduct research in VLSI CAD areas at the                advanced undergraduate and graduate levels.  North Carolina A&T State           University will serve as the HUB school, where they can assist other            HBCU institutions towards implementing a course and research                    activities.  The targeted outreach schools are:  Southern University,           Tuskegee University, Tennessee State University, Howard University,             Hampton University and Prairie View University.  Selected faculty               members from the departments of electrical engineering and/or computer          science will attend a one week workshop where the fundamentals of Mead          and Conway VLSI design methodology will be presented.  The workshop             will include: i) an overview of VLSI CAD methodology, ii) principles of         MOS transistor technology, ii) an introduction to VLSI CAD                      workstations, and iv) laboratory exercises illustrating VLSI CAD                techniques.",
