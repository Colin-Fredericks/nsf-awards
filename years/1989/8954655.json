 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combining an academic-year leadership program with summer institutes for        junior and senior high school mathematics teachers, this three-year             project will develop a model for collaboration between a university and         the public schools.  Each year, five \"co-op teachers\" will spend the            academic year at the university, teaching and taking courses,                   participating in a colloquium on mathematics instruction, and working on        an independent project.  Each summer, twenty other teachers will                participate in a four-week workshop that focuses on problem-solving and         the use of microcomputers and programmable calculators in teaching              mathematics.  Follow-up activities include six meetings during the              academic year, as well as visits by the university faculty and the co-op        teachers to the participants' classrooms.                                                                                                                       The evaluation will assess the project's effect on the participants'            teaching practices and the co-op teachers' development as instructional         leaders.  The project will serve a total of 75 teachers, including 15           co-op teachers, from the Tucson, Arizona, area.                                                                                                                 The university and the school districts are contributing as cost-sharing        an amount equal to 250% of the NSF award.",
