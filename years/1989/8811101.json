 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the analytical modelling of a particular class           of mechanical shaft couplings.  Such couplings are used to connect              rotating shafts which intersect at an angle.  Those prevalent in                practice include the universal joint and the constant velocity joint.           The latter class includes the Rzeppa coupling which is the subject of           this study.  These couplings are used in a variety of applications,             most notably in the wheel drives of front wheel drive automobiles,              where transmission of constant angular rate is desired.  Presently,             Rzeppa couplings are designed empirically.  The general procedure is to         construct a number of prototypes embodying the wisdom of prior                  experience and then proof test to determine which model should be put           into production.  If none is adequate, then repeating the procedure is          required.  In the today's competitive world with its demands for higher         speeds, increased loads, and improved reliability, this method is               excessively expensive and time consuming.  The purpose of this study is         to provide analytical procedures for the design of Rzeppa couplings.            Dual number element coordinate transformation matrix methods will be            applied to analyze its kinematic and static behavior.  Specific topics          addressed herein include synthesis of pilot lever proportions, cyclic           velocity fluctuations through pilot lever manipulation, Rzeppa coupling         groove geometry, load sharing among coupling balls, general analysis            methodology, and experimental investigations.  This investigation has           the added feature that it will further generalize the analysis                  procedures for general spatial mechanisms.",
