 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to purchase equipment for the                         Department of Biochemistry at the University of Nebraska,                       Lincoln.  A set of undergraduate biochemistry laboratory                        experiences will be developed, which will be novel in that all                  the experiments will be focused on one enzyme or the gene coding                for that enzyme.  The enzyme will be Escherichia coli B-                        galactosidase.  A major student criticism of usual laboratory                   curriculum is that it is disjointed and the experiments from one                week to the next are unrelated.  The goals of this project are to               improve student interest in learning by providing a coordinated                 and centrally focused series of experiments, to increase the                    student's perception of the relevance of different biochemical                  techniques and to provide a sense of the unity of biochemical                   laboratory techniques.  Equipment will be used for                              spectrophotometry and kinetics (spectrophotometer and chart                     recorders), enzyme chromatography (pumps, column monitors,                      fraction collectors), electrophoresis (power supplies and                       apparatus) and basic molecular biochemistry (centrifuges, vacuum                oven, and transilluminator/camera).  The grantee institution is                 matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.",
