 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on designing and evaluating an Object Flow                 Computer for large database applications.  The main features of this            parallel system are (a) the direct support of an object-oriented                semantic association model, which can model complex data more                   explicitly than existing data models; (b) the use of a two-phase query          processing technique, which can drastically reduce the amount of data           to be transferred among parallel processors; (c) the use of a vertical          fragmentation model based on semantic properties of data, which                 increases the degree of concurrency and minimizes unnecessary data              transfers; and (d) the integration of a number of software and hardware         techniques to solve very large database management problems.  Research          is carried out on analyzing the cost-performance tradeoffs in designing         object-oriented processing functions in hardware and software.                                                                                                  An object-oriented database management system possesses many desirable          features, which include data abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism,            information hiding, and uniform treatment of data and meta-data.  The           extension of object-oriented database management systems with semantic          modeling holds great promise in supporting advanced application, such           as CAD/CAM, CASE, and office automation.  However, many of the                  essential techniques and their implementation in hardware and software          are not well understood.  This project addresses the design tradeoffs           subject to technological and application requirements from an                   analytical and experimental points of view.  Results developed will             lead to more efficient and faster object-oriented database management           systems.",
