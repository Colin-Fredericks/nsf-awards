 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent theoretical research has convincingly established that                   cooperative behavior can be maintained among selfish, rational                  individuals simply through the processes of repeated interaction and            appropriate mutual expectations.  That research provides the basis for          a theory of social cohesion in groups of all kinds, and provides tools          for analyzing conditions under which cooperation, altruism, stability,          etc., are likely to continue or to decay.  The theory makes no                  provision for formal mechanisms of communication, coordination or               enforcement in groups or organizations.                                                                                                                         Several fundamental questions remain unanswered concerning the                  creation and maintenance of social cohesion, however.  In particular,           the previous research demonstrates that there are generally many                patterns of behavior and expectations under which cooperation could be          maintained, but these patterns are likely to be incompatible:  if one           person's expectations conform to one such pattern, and another's                expectations conform to another pattern, then they may fail to achieve          cooperation at all.  For spontaneous cooperation to arise, individuals          must have corresponding expectations about the appropriate behavior. To         explain how social cohesion gets started, and to understand how it is           maintained under changing conditions, requires that we understand how           people overcome this problem of coordination.                                                                                                                   The  current research investigation aims to extend the theory of                cooperation among rational individuals to explain how problems of               coordination can be solved.  In particular, the researchers will                mathematically model various communication processes, using the same            general approach as previous models have taken toward cooperation.              They will then evaluate the ability of these processes to promote               coordination, taking full account of the existence of uncertainty and           private information, and of the mutually recognized opportunity for             individuals to manipulate, conceal, or misrepresent through                     communication.                                                                                                                                                  In their most general form, such communication processes amount                 tosocial institutions - - norms, traditions, constitutions, and                 leadership institutions, to name just a few examples.  The expectation          is that rational behavior within these processes can explain the                ability (or failure) of social institutions to maintain cooperation or          cohesion in all kinds of settings.  Once developed, the theory will             allow a specification of an experimental design for testing hypotheses          about complex cooperation and the design of institutions in the                 laboratory, and to specify statistical models for the testing of                hypotheses about existing social, economic, and political                       organizaitons.  If successful, the theory will have important                   implications for our understanding of may forms of social                       organization, including the structure of economic markets and                   regulation, the design of constitutions, and the structure of political         agencies.",
