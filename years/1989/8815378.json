 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in astronomy between             Dr. Thomas Troland, together with Dr. Richard Crutcher, University              of Kentucky, and Dr. Ilya Kazes, Observatoire de Meudon, France.                                                                                                One of the most compelling problems of galactic astronomy today is              the process whereby clouds of interstellar material gather                      together, form new stars and eventually disperse.  Theoretical                  studies indicate that magnetic fields may play a crucial role in                this evolutionary process.  Yet magnetic field strengths are the                least well determined of all relevant physical quantities in the                interstellar medium, especially in molecular clouds.  In the past               few years, Drs. Troland and Crutcher have launched a major                      observational program to correct this deficiency.  Their studies of             the Zeeman effect in 18 centimeter OH lines have yielded most of                the information that now exists regarding field strengths in                    molecular clouds.  Most of these studies have been carried out with             the Nancay radio telescope, which now functions very efficiently                for this purpose.  They seek to continue this work at Nancay, which             will complement Zeeman effect observations in progress with the                 NRAO 43 meter  telescope and the Arecibo telescope.  Data collected             at all sites will permit significant experimental tests of current              theories on magnetic effects in the interstellar medium.  The                   investigators also plan to begin work on another project,                       millimeter wavelength Zeeman effect observations with the IRAM 30               meter telescope.  Moreover, additional observations made with the               IRAM telescope  will form part of a study of densities in regions               searched for the Zeeman effect.  The results of this proposed work              may contribute significantly to our understanding of molecular                  clouds and of the star-forming processes within them.",
