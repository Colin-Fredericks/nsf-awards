The basic aim of statistical mechanics                  is to obtain the large scale thermodynamic behavior of a many                   particle system from a knowledge of the microscopic interaction                 between the particles.  The thermodynamic behavior is described                 as a function of a few parameters such as temperature and                       destiny.                                                                             The principal investigator will study a classical gas with                 short range interaction at high temperature.  He plans to show                  that at a sufficiently high temperature there is no phase                       transition.  The main task is to study the high density system                  and show that it is approximately gaussian.                                          He will also study ground state energies of systems with                   long range Coulomb interaction.  These systems are particularly                 important since the electromagnetic Coulomb force is ubiquitous                 in nature.  For a system of charged Bosons in a jellium                         background, he wants to show that the thermodynamic limit of                    the ground state energy per particle is, at high densities,                     given precisely by a formula of Foldy.  This would show that                    the Bogoliubov ansatz, which is widely used in heuristic                        theories of superfluidity and superconductivity, is valid in a                  certain case.",
