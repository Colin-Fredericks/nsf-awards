 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the department of Geography at the                 University of Manoa to purchase equipment to upgrade the physical               geography component of the undergraduate curriculum.  The                       existing curriculum in physical, climatology, and water resources               at the University is focussed on processes in the tropical                      environment.  Because of the relief, geology, vegetation, and the               agricultural and urban land uses, Hawaii is a microcosm of                      climatic diversity.  It is an ideal place to study climate.                     However, full advantage is not being take of this rich teaching                 opportunity.  The key element missing in the curriculum is direct               field observation (measurement).  To exploit the natural                        laboratory that is Hawaii's environment, the department needs to                acquire the instruments with which students can monitor and                     analyze the important processes.                                                                                                                                This award will help enhance undergraduate education in geography               by providing sets of climate sensors (measuring wind speed and                  direction, temperature, humidity, rainfall, net radiation, solar                radiation, and soil heat flux), data recording devices,                         computers, and accessory equipment for use by instructors and                   students.  The purpose of the project is to provide students with               a sequence of increasingly advanced learning experiences through                the measurement and interpretation of environmental data.  The                  grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from                  non-Federal sources.",
