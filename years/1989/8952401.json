 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project utilizes an inert atmosphere box with associated                   equipment for use by students in a course entitled Advanced Synthesis           Laboratory.  This course, offered to upper level chemistry majors,              involves the student in the preparation, isolation and characterization         of a variety of primarily inorganic compounds, the synthesis of which           requires the student to master in an integrated fashion many of the             techniques involved in modern synthetic chemistry.  The particular              techniques include familiar ones such as filtration, distillation,              recrystallization, and refluxing, to which are added less common ones,          such as syringing of reagents, vacuum line manipulations, and reactions         conducted under an inert atmosphere.  This project incorporates the             equipment needed to do inert atmosphere work into the laboratory.  The          institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
