 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leaves alternate between periods of gradually changing photosynthesis           and dark metabolism under the natural daily cycling of light, yet they          provide a steady supply of sucrose to sustain the uninterrupted                 development of growing parts of the plant.  To do this, leaves must             utilize stored carbohydrate during periods of low light and distribute          carbohydrate between export and renewal of storage during periods of            high photosynthesis.  Regulation of leaf carbohydrate metabolism and            export from source leaves provides the means to meet these demands.             Mutant plants which lack the ability to synthesize or degrade starch            have markedly reduced seed production, which confirms the importance of         export of stored carbohydrate during periods of low photosynthesis.             This research project will study key aspects of processes by which              leaves maintain this steady supply of sucrose for export.                                                                                                       The program is aimed at identifying and understanding regulation of             carbon allocation, translocation, and partitioning with a view to               increasing basic knowledge needed for improving crop plants.  These             processes affect crop productivity directly by supplying carbon to              sinks of economic importance.  The PI's approach is to investigate the          physiology and biochemistry of these processes and their integrated             regulation needed to provide a basis for genetic and molecular                  manipulation of these processes.  The response of leaf carbon metabolism        to changes in photosynthesis rate during a sinusoidal light regime,             which simulates a natural day, demonstrates the importance of multiple          sources of carbon in maintaining export rate during the day.  These             sources will be studied to identify the biochemical and molecular               mechanisms involved in their regulation and coordination.  Plants that          use either starch exclusively or sucrose and starch to maintain export          will be compared to determine the basis of these differences.  The              coordination of starch synthesis and degradation with photosynthesis            rate is important in maintaining a steady rate of sucrose synthesis             throughout a sinusoidal light regime.  The pathways by which newly-             fixed carbon and carbon from starch are converted to sucrose will be            investigated.  A further program goal is to isolate and maintain plant          mutants having altered starch metabolism for studying the regulation of         starch synthesis and degradation.",
