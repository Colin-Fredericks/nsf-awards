 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of protocols for cryostorage of living cells requires the            determination of cryoprotectant type and concentration, cooling rate,           and final prequench temperature that prevent the formation of                   intracellular ice.  In this project, a fundamentally new approach will          be taken, involving the development of a generalized probability model          of the incidence of intracellular ice formation (IIF) during cell               freezing.  Detailed cryomicroscopic experiments will be performed on a          mammalian germplasm system to (1) establish the existence and magnitude         of the cell supercooling tolerance, (2) develop the mathematical forms          of a probability model for instantaneous and time-dependent IIF, and            (3) determine the parametric effect of cryoprotectants on the                   supercooling tolerance and probability of IIF.  Concepts from                   reliability theory will be used to develop a mathematical model of the          probability of IIF and to synthesize various sources of randomness in           cell freezing behavior.  A reduced set of experiments will be performed         on a plant cell system to test the universality of the modeling                 approach.  The model will be used to explore the feasibility of                 innovative cooling protocols that could significantly increase cell             survival rates.                                                                                                                                                 This project will result in a fundamental step forward in the                   development of engineering models of the response of cells to freezing,         and in the creation of new analytical tools with which to design                cryopreservation protocols.  The development of the model will have a           wide range of cryopreservation applications:  human and animal sperm,           oocytes, and embryos; organs and specialized tissues; plants shoot tips         for asexually propagated species; and the conservation of the germplasm         of endangered plant and animal species.",
