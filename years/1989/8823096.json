 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Gordon Research Conference is to foster the               interaction of scientists from various disciplines on temperature               stresses.  The program includes sessions on:  role of membranes, biology        of cell surface, cryobiology, temperature responses of pollen and seeds,        high temperature plant responses, functions of heat shock proteins, ice         nucleation, and biotechnology and molecular genetics.  A unique feature         of the Gordon Research Conference is the free and uninhibited exchange          of information between scientists of many disciplines.  Two previous            Gordon Conferences on this topic were highly successful in fostering            communication and promoting cooperative interdisciplinary research among        scientists in industry, academic institutions and federal agencies.  At         present there is no comparable forum for the intensive, wide ranging and        productive interdisciplinary exchange of relevant information and ideas.                                                                                        The area of temperature stress in plants represents one of the most             important factors affecting crops world wide.  It is also one of the            most advanced areas in plant biotechnology.  Thus, this conference              addresses not only one of the most important aspects affecting plant            growth and agriculture, but also an area where scientific advances are          at the forefront of biology.  This conference is the only one on this           topic that is held regularly.",
