The workshop will be                           scheduled for a four-day period in the summer of 1990 at the                    University of California's Arrowhead Conference Center.                                                                                                         The large growth in environmental issues has resulted in a                      demand for engineers that is not now being adequately met.                      This is a result partially of the process through which                         education in environmental engineering has evolved which, in                    effect, requires students to obtain graduate degrees for                        entry-level positions.  This suggests a need to reconsider                      the process by which environmental engineers are prepared for                   professional careers.  Results of this workshop will provide                    guidance in potential structuring of an environmental                           engineering program including opportunities for conduct of                      research at institutions offering primarily undergraduate                       degrees in engineering.",
