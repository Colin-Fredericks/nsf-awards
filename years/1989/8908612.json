 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this investigation is to improve the                   performance of computer architectures used for scientific and                   engineering computation.  More specifically, characteristics of                 scientific applications combined, with trends in integrated circuit             technology indicate that memory system performance will soon be, if it          is not already, the processing bottleneck in these architectures.  The          research focuses on issues related to the improvement of memory system          performance.                                                                                                                                                    The first phase of the investigation studies characteristics of data            access in scientific codes.  An understanding of vector and array usage         in applications is a prerequisite to designing efficient memory                 structures.  The second part of the investigation considers the                 benefits of uncovering the memory architecture to system software.  In          particular, the recent work proposing the use of dynamic storage                schemes in main memory will be expanded upon.  This technique of using          compile time and run time generated knowledge of program behavior to            dynamically optimize the memory architecture will be considered                 experimentally, using simulation, and theoretically.  Emphasis is               placed on the use of storage schemes to reduce contention for shared            memory modules and the processor-memory interconnection network.                Concurrently, a set of tools to provide interactive animation and               simulation of main memory architectures will be developed.",
