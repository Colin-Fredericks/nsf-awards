 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis and properties of two classes of electroactive               polymers will be carried out; in both cases the synthesis and                   processing represent chemistry and processing techniques that are               somewhat novel.                                                                      The first type of electroactive polymer, synthesized by the                oxidative coupling of 2,5-diethynylthiophenes and containing                    thiophene rings connected by 1,3-diyne units, could be fabricated               into a highly oriented film because of its rod-like structure and               facile processability.  This polymer should be conductive,                      possesses the structural features necessary for transformation                  into an intrinsically conductive material, and conversion                       thermally, chemically, or photochemically into unique structures                that could exhibit a variety of electroacitve properties.                            The second class of polymer, containing a conjugated donor-                acceptor unit designed to exhibit efficient second harmonic                     generation, can be synthesized by the polymerization of an                      ordered monomer assembly.  This  assembly is achieved by poling a               non-racemic chiral monomer (ferroelectric monomer) ia a smectic C               phase and then effecting the polymerization through radical or                  cationic initiation.                                                                 The synthesis of these materials should ultimately allow                   the fabrication of various devices with improved electronic and                 computer speed and capacity.",
