Candidates with background in India who apply to AIIS are                       screened, and those nominated are referred to NSF for final                     selection.  The AIIS manages the required clearances for                        the research, and the logistics involved in the travel,                         local arrangement and conduct of research in India.  They                       therefor meet NSF and Government of India requirements as                       well as the scientists' needs.  Areas of research typically                     include anthropology, linguistics, sociology, economics,                        political sciences as well as biology, mathematics and                          engineering.  The U.S.-India program supports U.S.                              scientific research in India in areas of interest to NSF                        and where the research could lead to better understanding                       between the two contries through science.  This project                         meets program criteria.                                                                                                                                         Scope:  The AIIS is a very well organized institute with                        membership of over 42 of the major U.S. universities and                        colleges with South Asian or Indian Studies programs.  The                      AIIS reviews their applicants through selection panels made                     of eminent scientists in various broad scientific                               disciplines.  The AIIS offices in New Delhi and other major                     cities in India have well-established contacts with                             Government of India departments and are capable of                              facilitating U.S. researchers' collaboration with host                          institutes.  The areas of research considered are broad,                        and funds from this project are used only for those                             normally supportable by NSF science divisions.  The                             candidates and awardees are carefully screened both by the                      AIIS and by NSF.  This program clearly strengthens the                          scientific collaboration and understanding between India                        and the U.S.                                                                                                                                                    Funding: It is intended to support this effort over three                       years at a total of $876,786 in Indian rupees plus                              US$64,000 as follows:                                                                                                                                           FY89: US$28,000 plus $135,714 in Indian rupees                                  FY90: US$18,000 plus $370,536 in Indian rupees                                  FY91: US$18.000 plus $370,536 in Indian rupees                                                                                                                  Support in FY90 and FY91 is subject to availablitiy of                          funds.  AIIS is funded for other parts of its program by                        other U.S. government agencies, including the Smithsonian                       Institution and the United States Informjation Agency.",
