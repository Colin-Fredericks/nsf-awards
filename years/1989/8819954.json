 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structural and functional diversity directly contribute to an                   animal's sensory abilities.  Receptor, processor and effector                   units allow an animal to utilize sensory information as an                      environmental resource.  Comparative study of sensory systems is                important because it may help explain the relative evolutionary                 success of certain species.  This interdisciplinary conference                  takes this integrative perspective to examine vision in                         elasmobranch branch fishes, which include the sharks and rays.                  Elasmobranchs represent a relatively small but evolutionarily                   very important group of vertebrates.  While some species of these               animals have relatively primitive organization of certain                       systems, other species have remarkably specialized adaptations;                 vision is one sense showing such diversity.  A variety of recent                studies have explored visual biochemistry, anatomy, physiology,                 and behavior in these animals.  This conference will coalesce                   this recent information around the functioning of the visual                    system of elasmobranchs, its relation to ecological factors, and                its importance to understanding vision in the vertebrates.  This                conference is novel for neuroscience because instead of using                   different animals to look at functions from a subcellular or                    cellular perspective, it uses one animal group to look at sensory               function from perspectives ranging from the subcellular to the                  ecological.  The work will have impact on work on visual science,               on other sensory systems, on ecology and on marine biology.",
