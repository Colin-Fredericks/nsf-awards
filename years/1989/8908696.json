 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two distinct but related lines of                      investigation.  The first is a largely empirical investigation of               the ways in which various entry level job markets for elite                     professionals are organized.  The motivation for the                            investigation is provided by preliminary evidence that markets in               which both workers and firms are highly heterogeneous may have                  some important features in common with one another, and may in                  general behave quite differently, and require different kinds of                analysis, than markets involving fairly homogeneous firms and                   workers.  Specifically, the project analyzes the American market                for interns and residents, several parallel markets for beginning               physicians which operate in the different regions of the National               Health Service in the United Kingdom; the system by which French                university professors obtain positions; the market for graduates                of the University of Tokyo; and aspects of the markets for                      graduates of top American law and business schools.                                                                                                             The second line of research is primarily theoretical, and                       consists of three parts.  The first part explores why a variety                 of related two-sided matching models have similar properties,                   although they require different assumptions.  The second part                   develops matching models with incomplete information that are                   more appropriate for real world problems.  The third part                       consists of modelling and exploring the phenomena uncovered in                  the ongoing empirical investigations.                                                                                                                           This ambitious project should be supported because of the                       insights it will provide in the performance of such important                   labor markets as those for physicians, lawyers and business                     school graduates.  The research will also improve matching                      theory.  This is valuable because many different economic                       problems can be represented as matching problems.",
