 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data is presented suggesting that Slow Component a (SCa) of                   axonal transport involves the movement along microtubules of an                 insoluble complex of tubulin, neurofilament, spectrin, and other                proteins.  These structures have been given the provision acronym               \"SCAPs.\"  The goal of this research is to gain a fuller                         understanding of these structures.  The protein composition of                  highly purified SCAPs will be analyzed by routine biochemical and               immunochemical approaches.  A microtubule-stimulated ATPase is                  present in SCAP preparations, which appears to be responsible for               the in vitro phenomenon of microtubular gelation-contraction.                   This ATPase activity will be characterized biochemically, with                  the goal of identifying and understanding the action of the                     enzyme(s) involved.  The properties of this ATPase activity and                 its relationship to microtubule gelation-contraction in vitro                   (and possibly to SCAP movement in vivo) will be analyzed.                                                                                                       These experiments will provide significant new information                      relevant to the validity of the hypothesis that SCa involves the                translocation of SCAPs along microtubules.",
