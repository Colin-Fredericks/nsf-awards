 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ceramic membranes have good pore size uniformity, and good                      thermal and mechanical properties.  They can be used at high                    temperatures (1000\u001aC) and in the corrosive environments often                   found in the chemical industry.  They have the additional                       advantage that they can be thermally treated (500\u001aC), steam                     cleaned and sterilized.  Many industrial catalytic reactions                    show low conversion and/or yields due either to unfavorable                     thermodynamics, product inhibition or undesirable side                          reactions.  This in turn necessitates more severe operating                     conditions (which in turn require higher catalyst replacement                   rates) and costly separation operations.  Catalytic membrane                    reactors, units in which the membrane is an integral part of                    the reactor, combine reaction and separation in a single unit                   operation.  Such units have the advantage that the membrane                     provides for selective removal of one or more products and/or                   stable intermediates in parallel with the reaction, thus                        driving the reaction continuously towards the product side and                  resulting in higher conversions.  With higher conversion, the                   process can be run at lower pressure and temperature,                           resulting in longer catalyst life, reduced recycle, and                         reduced downstream separation requirements.  The membrane also                  enables control of surface concentrations and therefore                         selectivity and product distribution.                                                                                                                           It is the primary goal of this Industry University Cooperative                  Research (IUCR) project to test the applicability of ceramic                    membrane reactor technology in the area of oil and asphaltene                   hydro processing.  Two types of alumina ceramic membranes will                  be studied, membranes prepared by anodic oxidation of aluminum                  and membranes prepared by the Sol-Gel technique.  Both kinds                    of membranes have a virtually unimodal pore size distribution                   and show excellent separatory functions.  They have different                   surface properties and different pore structures and could                      therefore have different capabilities and/or uses.",
