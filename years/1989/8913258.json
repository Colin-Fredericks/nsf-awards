 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Hawaii will undertake a project to adapt                      and modify a new type of oxygen sensor for oceanographic                        purposes.  The new potentiostatic, solid-state oxygen sensor                    was developed for the biomedical community.  Unlike existing                    polarographic oxygen sensors, potentiostatic sensors have no                    membrane and therefore have comparatively fast response to                      changes in oxygen levels.  They have been shown to work in                      the laboratory and in the field, but their immediate use for                    environmental applications has been hampered by flow rate and                   temperature dependence.  Experiments will determine the cause                   for these sources of error and improvements will be made for                    oceanographic and environmental purposes.  This will be                         accomplished by drawing together expertise from ocean                           science, industry, and design electrochemistry.  Solid-state                    potentiostatic oxygen sensors should provide greatly improved                   capabilities over present methods for making scientifically                     important dissolved oxygen measurements in the oceans.                          Developing a more reliable and more accurate dissolved oxygen                   sensor has been recognized as a high priority of the                            oceanographic research community.",
