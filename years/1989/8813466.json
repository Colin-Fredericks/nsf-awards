 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Loucas Christophorou is supported by a grant from The                       Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the mechanism                  for optically enhanced electron attachment to electronically                    excited molecules.  This research has important implications in                 the potential design of light activated electronic switching                    devices.                                                                                                                                                        Dr. Christophorou has shown, in collaboration with his                          colleagues at Oak Ridge National Laboratories, that                             electronically excited states of certain molecules, produced                    indirectly by laser irradiation, can possess orders of                          magnitude larger electron attachment cross sections than                        corresponding ground electronic states.  With this grant Dr.                    Christophorou will perform research directed at establishing                    the precise mechanism for this observation.  Most of the                        research will be carried out on thiophenol which has been the                   subject of the preliminary investigations; however, the                         research will also be extended to studies of photofragments                     produced by the laser induced photodecomposition of carbon                      disulfide.",
