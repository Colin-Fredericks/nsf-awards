 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conlon will investigate the structure of codimension one                   foliations.  The existence of foliations of knot complements,                   leafwise hyperbolic structures, smoothability of foliations, and                ergodic properties will be studied. This work expands the                       Principal Investigator's theory of levels which has made a                      profound impact on development of foliation theory and has led to               interaction with the French and Japanese schools of foliations.                      The mathematical theory of foliations concerns the filling                 of space by stacks of surfaces or \"leaves\".  Conlon helped to                   prove that any surface may be a leaf of a foliation.  Since some                surfaces wrap upon themselves, this proof was very difficult.                   Now Conlon will further his theory by understanding foliations                  which fill all of a space except for a knot.  The understanding                 of knots has recently become very important to the understanding                of thermodynamics and molecular biology.",
