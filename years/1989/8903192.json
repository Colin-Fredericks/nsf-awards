 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four investigators will collaborate on a project directed at               mathematical problems originating in the theories of harmonic                   analysis and partial differential equations.  Emphasis will be on               the study of elliptic and parabolic boundary value problems on                  domains with relatively coarse boundaries (Lipschitz domains),                  and on the study of elliptic equations with non-smooth                          coefficients. Other work will focus on variational problems                     involving free boundaries, geometric problems related to                        curvature and Schrodinger multipliers for the free Schrodinger                  equation.                                                                            Recent advances in elliptic problems have led to sharp                     estimates on solutions of elliptic systems arising in                           hydrostatics (the Stokes system) and in the Lame systems of                     elastostatics, defined on Lipschitz domains.  The estimates                     relate quadratic norms of maximal functions defined on the domain               with the same norm of the solution restricted to the boundary.                  The immediate goal of this research is to extend, as far as                     possible, the estimates to other power norms.  The difficulty one               encounters is that the fundamental DeGiorgi-Nash-Moser theory for               second order divergence form equations does not carry over to                   systems. Moreover, examples suggest that progress in dimensions                 greater than three will be especially difficult to achieve.                          Work on free boundary problems is motivated by questions in                the theory of liquid crystals: droplets, moving defects,                        disclination, phase transition and flow phenomena.  The                         description of the boundaries between liquid crystals and other                 materials, line defects in the liquid and other characteristics                 of liquid crystals require the analysis of complex, singular                    systems of differential equations.  A new model is to be studied                in this work which promises to simplify several of the obstacles                present in current models.                                                           Studies of nonlinear elliptic equations related to more                    geometrical issues will also be undertaken.  These fall into                    three categories, the Matukuma equation, the scalar curvature                   equations and nonlinear mean curvature equations.  The first                    relates to the Eddington model of the dynamics of globular star                 clusters - a problem about which there has been renewed interest.                    One primary goal of this work is to determine the degree of                symmetry one can expect in solutions.  The second concerns the                  question of determining metrics on manifolds which produce a                    given scalar curvature while the third concerns equations                       prescribing mean curvature.  The latter problems involve                        questions of existence and regularity of solutions to problems in               capillarity theory.",
