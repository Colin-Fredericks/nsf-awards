 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine how the morphology and                          demography of the fine root system of plants enables the                        acquisition of two limiting soil resources:  water and nitrogen.                The ability of plants to alter fine root morphology (length,                    width, branching pattern, production of root hairs) and                         demography (birth, death, and elongation rate) is thought to                    affect the rate at which then encounter and exploit soil                        resources.  The overall hypothesis is that species differences in               fine root morphology and demography regulate their ability to                   acquire below.ground resources and therefore compete for these                  resources.  The ability to encounterand exploit resource patches                that vary in space and time must be linked to root morphology and               dynamics.  Several specific hypotheses will be tested in a series               of greenhouse experiments.  Fine root dynamics will be measured                 using in situ video imaging of minirhizotrons and summarized                    using life-tables and projection matrices.  By varying the                      availability and spatial distribution of water and nitrogen, and                by using 15C as a tracer, we will be able to measure the                        relationship between fine and root morphology and dynamics and                  resource acquisition.  This research is novel and innovative                    because it utilizes new technology to understand how resource                   availability drives fine root demography.  Until now, virtually                 all ecological investigations have either ignored fine roots (a                 major carbon sink), or quantified them in one or aseries of                     static observations.  This project will make significant progress               toward the development of a more mechanistic understanding of                   competition for soil resources in terrestrial plants.",
