 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the heart of harmonic analysis are two fundamental                      issues: how to decompose a function into elementary constituent                 parts and how to recover a function from those parts.  The                      genesis for this mathematical framework is the Fourier series.                  In trying to understand how a function can be recovered from its                Fourier series, one is led to questions of averages of functions                and singular integral operators.  It is the study of these                      concepts which forms the basis for this research.                                    The genesis of this particular project lies in the classical               real-variable result of Lebesgue which gives a precise solution                 of when one can differentiate an integral and recover the                       integrand.  There is no complete analogue to this situation in                  higher dimensions since the method of passing to the limit allows               many interpretations.  This work focuses on a limiting procedure                where one restricts functions to surfaces of various dimensions                 and either takes limits or makes maximizing estimates of                        approximate derivatives (averages).  These tasks amount to                      estimating norms of singular integrals over surfaces.  While                    there has been considerable progress made on over the past two                  decades, the main problems of describing the correct class of                   curves or surfaces along which a differentiation theory can be                  built remains daunting.  The shape of the surface plays a                       critical role and this work will continue to clarify the                        conditions needed to produce a comprehensive theory.                                  Although the general description of this research is                      phrased in the language of harmonic analysis, much of its                       influence derives from applications to partial differential                     equations.",
