 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides one-half of the funds required to                      purchase equipment items needed to upgrade the Sedimentary                      Basins Research Facility in the Department of Earth,                            Atmospheric & Planetary Sciences at MIT. The remaining funds                    required will be provided by the institution.                                        Equipment items included in the upgrade are a microscope                   and a cathodoluminescence-fluorescence optical system. A                        sedimentary basin is a site of pronounced sediment                              accumulation. Commonly, sediments fill major depressions in the                 Earth's crust, producing deposits that are 1-10 kilometers                      thick. Crustal subsidence on such scales occurs in a variety of                 tectonic settings, ranging from tensional rifts and passive                     continental margins to foreland regions associated with active                  compression. A major focus of sedimentary basin studies at MIT                  is to identify and isolate basin formative mechanisms so that                   basin history can be understood. The objectives of such studies                 are to reach better understanding of basin evolution and to                     improve knowledge of the processes (such as oil formation and                   migration) that operate at deep levels in the basins.",
