 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of enzymes in organic solvents is a relatively new                      technology that significantly extends conventional aqueous-                                                                                                     based biocatalysis.  However, the multitude of applications                                                                                                     in areas such as organic synthesis and enzyme-based                             analyses have provided only the framework for elucidating                       the principles and parameters that govern enzymatic                             catalysis in organic media.  Two long-term research                             directions will be pursued during the course of the PYI                         award and include l) the understanding and control of the                       parameters that dictate enzymatic catalysis in non-aqueous                      media; and 2) the development of methodologies for the use                      of enzymes as catalysts in organic synthesis.  The first                        goal involves studying the role of the solvent on enzyme                        structure and function.  EPR spin labeling will be                              performed to probe enzymic active site and surface                              microenvironments during catalysis in non-aqueous media.                        The second goal has far reaching implications for regio-and                     stereoselective biotransformations.  Specific reactions to                      be studied include the synthesis of sugar-containing                            polyesters for                                                                  biodegradable polymers, peroxidase-produced phenolic resins                                                                                                     as formaldehyde-free plastics replacements, and selective                       synthesis of oligosaccharides.                                                                                                                                  Enzymes are nature's catalysts that exhibit keen reaction                       specificities and fast rates of catalysis under mild                            conditions.  Traditionally, enzymes have been thought of as                                                                                                     water-based catalysts.  Because enzymes function in a water                                                                                                     (aqueous) environment within living tissues, nearly all                         applications of enzymes in biocatalysis has involved                            aqueous solutions.  Unfortunately, for most reactions of                        commercial interest (e.g., pharmaceutical manufacture,                          synthetic intermediates, plastics production, etc.), water                      is not a suitable reaction medium.  Synthetic chemists had                      realized this long ago, and most organic reactions are                          routinely performed in organic (non-aqueous) solvents.                          Recently, a number of research groups have shown that                           enzymes can function in organic solvents.  The research                         directions being targeted during the course of this PYI                         award involve both fundamental and applied aspects of                           enzymatic catalysis in organic media.  From a fundamental                       standpoint, the factors that control enzyme function in                         solvents will be studied.",
