The specific aims of the proposed project             are to collect data on two groups of Black American infants (one high           risk and one normative) and their mothers to:                                     1) examine the quality of the infant's attachment relationships to              mother at 12 and 18 months                                                      2) delineate sociocultural and environmental factors in the mother-             child relationship that might influence the quality and stability of            infant attachment                                                               3) gather information on other child developmental outcomes through             age two.                                                                                                                                                      During the planning period, the PI will: strengthen her capability to           plan a proposed research project and prepare a proposal for submission          to the MRI program, facilitate a preliminary study in the area of the           proposed project, and facilitate other activities related to planning           the proposed research and preparing the proposal.",
