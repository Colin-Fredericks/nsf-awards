 "awd_abstract_narration": "The idea of treating a structural system in a statistical manner                has been developed in order to understand the global response of                the structure when many modes are excited.  The statistical                     energy analysis (SEA) approach has been widely used for                         determining the dynamic response to broad band excitation of                    linear one and two dimensional structures and three dimensional                 internal acoustic fields.  This project extends the method to (1)               three dimensional solids, (2) external (unbounded) acoustic                     fields, (3) small scale, local structural nonlinearities and (4)                SEA for coupled systems.  In the first phase, the SEA result will               initially be derived within the framework of a three dimensional,               linear viscoelastic solid and then extended to a viscoelastic                   solid combined with a metallic structural foundation.  In phase                 two, the Principal Investigator will use his previously developed               SEA method for ascertaining the acoustic far field when a two                   dimensional structure is responding in many modes.  The intent                  here is to compare this concept with the full classical modal                   result to determine the SEA method's range of applicability.  In                phase three, the classical component mode synthesis method is                   combined with SEA concepts to ascertain the global effects of                   nonlinearities on a structure when many modes have been excited.                In phase four, the intent is to refine the methods currently                    available for determining loss factors between coupled systems.                 The impact of this work will be to permit a better description of               the dynamics of complex dynamical systems which are responding in               many degrees of freedom.",
