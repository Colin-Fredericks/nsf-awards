 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is in the general area of analytical and surface                  chemistry and in the subfield of atomic spectroscopy. The goal                  of this research is to elucidate the processes which lead to                    emission of light from inductively coupled plasmas (ICPs). The                  fundamental hypothesis of this research is that the ICP is a                    dynamic system which appears to be kinetically controlled. This                 research is designed to study the time-dependent processes of                   ICP including ionization, recombination, and excitation. This                   will be accomplished by modulating the power delivered to the                   plasma. Such an approach will allow studies of the spatial and                  temporal response of excited and ionic species in the plasma.                                                                                                   This research is designed to better understand the processes                    which lead to emission of light in special high temperature                     sources called plasmas. The overall goal is to provide better                   elemental analysis using this special source.",
