 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Missouri Botanical Garden will conduct for three years, a                   series of short courses for teachers in grades 4-8 in the                       Metropolitan St. Louis area for training and up-dating of                       education materials in ecology and environmental sciences.                      Over a three year period, 90 teachers will be selected for                      this project.  These teachers will better serve their                           students with their enhanced knowledge of ecology and                           environmental sciences, and by integrating this knowledge                       into the newly mandated Missouri Core Competencies and Key                      Skills required in all classrooms.                                                                                                                              The proposed short course will enable teachers to learn                         ecology/environmental science concepts, to develop effective                    environmental science curricula based on the \"learning cycle\"                   and to implement those curricula successfully in the                            classroom by providing teachers with positive and successful                    role models.  Teachers will complete the objectives of the                      short course by meeting seven times over 12 months.  The long                   time-frame allows for development and implementation of                         curricular material in the classroom  The Short Course will                     be offered in conjunction with the University of Missouri -                     St. Louis and each participant will receive three graduate                      credits from the University.  All participants will develop                     an independent project to be tested in the classroom.                                                                                                           This project fits our program needs in that it has as its                       focus teachers in the middle grades, in a metropolitan area                     with a high percentage of minority students and provides                        updating in an area of importance to all students.                                                                                                              The Missouri Botanical Garden and the School Districts have                     contributed an amount equal to 37% of the National Science                      Foundation award.",
