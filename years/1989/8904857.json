 "awd_abstract_narration": "The results of previous systematic studies of Old World                    monkeys using morphological and molecular techniques have been in               disagreement.  Many possible relationships have been proposed for               members of the tribe Papionini (baboons, drills, mandrills,                     macaques and mangabeys), but no previous studies have been based                on nucleotide sequences.  The question of these relationships                   will be addressed using cytochrome c oxidase (COII) mitochondrial               gene nucleotide sequences to derive phylogeneic hypotheses.  This               gene is ideal for a study of Papionini systematics due to its                   rate of change, lack of recombination, and ease of study.                                                                                                            The results of this study should provide two kinds of                      valuable information.  First, a better understanding of the                     phyletic relationships among Old World monkeys should be                        possible.  Second, by comparing Papionini gene sequences to those               of other primates and non-primate mammals, a better understanding               will emerge of the rate of change in the mitochondrial genome.                  This is important since the rate affects conclusions regarding                  the order and timing of branching events, and consequently                      interpretations of the fossil record both for these primates and                for other primate lineages.",
