 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds to support a collaborative                       petrologic, structural, chemical, and isotopic investigation of                 the growth and development of continental crust as recorded in                  rocks of the middle crust (roughly 125-25 km).  The middle crust                is a dynamic environment through which Earth materials are cycled               both mechanically and chemically.  Supracrustal rocks may be                    transported to mid-crustal levels through tectonic processes;                   juvenile additions to the crust may be emplaced from the mantle;                fluid fluxes may initiate melting, possibly to produce                          charnockites, or leach LIL elements; melting in the middle crust                may extract large volumes of melt through vapor-absent melting.                 Artifacts of many of these processes have been recognized in two                distinct blocks of Archean crustal rocks in the northern Madison                Range, SW Montana.  Our integrated study of this segment of                     Archean continental crust will lead to a more comprehensive                     understanding of the geochemical processes that contribute to the               growth and development of continental crust, as well as to the                  specifics of the tectonic and magmatic cycles controlling crustal               evolution in the northern Wyoming Province.",
