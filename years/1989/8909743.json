The researchers will interview midwives, herbalists and                         supernatural healers and clients as well as government and public               health officials and academicians about the local uses of                       medicinal plants.  In additional ethnobotanical samples will be                 collected, photographed and prepared.  The study will assess the                differential use of fold medicine by different social classes,                  identify the illness syndromes associated with medicinal plants,                and relate the use and appreciation of folk ethnomedicine to the                available biomedical care.                                                      %%%                                                                                                                                                             This research is important in several ways: it will help us                     understand a folk medicine system used by many people in the USA                as well as in other countries; it will facilitate the research                  careers of women scientists by helping them start a pilot project               that should result in a major research proposal; and it will lay                the groundwork for future involvement of minority students in                   this research project.",
