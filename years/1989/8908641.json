 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed research will continue a line of work long supported              by this division that has over the years produced probably the most             innovative development of statistical methods for making sense of               social science data in the last forty years. Several different                  projects will be undertaken or completed, including one blending                classical methods used in analyzing variance in data typically                  collected by experimentally oriented behavioral and social science              research with graphic and other exploratory methods. Another, new               project will develop systematic treatment for the design and                    analysis of data simulations, long a method used by statisticians               for developing statistical tools. A third will develop new                      techniques of exploratory and robustness analysis (or extend                    techniques previously developed by the authors) to survey research              data. The PI has a most distinguished reputation among both social              scientists and statisticians because of remarkable production of                both technical and more accessible textbook materials describing and            illustrating the methods that continue to be developed.",
