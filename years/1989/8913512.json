It is                           proposed to identify biochemical steps which relate to time                                                                                                     constants that have been observed in previous research.                         Shifts in existing time constants or creation of new time                       constants as specific inhibitors are added in increasing                        amounts will indicate when a reaction becomes a bottleneck.                                                                                                     Another line of research will track a spectrum of                               frequencies with a diode-array spectrophotometer as a                           biosystem is forced.  Computerized analysis of the time                         constant for each frequency should show that different                          regions of the spectra respond with different time                              constants, and this should indicate the timing of events in                                                                                                     the control scheme.                                                                                                                                             Of the many steps and reactions for microbial growth and                        biosynthesis, one or two are slower than the others and are                                                                                                     the bottlenecks that control rates.  Well-established                           methods of engineering systems analysis will be combined                        with novel schemes for adding specific inhibitors of                            biochemical steps and tracking of spectral responses to                         identify these bottlenecks.  When the limiting steps are                        identified, it may be possible to modify the organisms or                       to supply crucial substrates to speed productivity.",
