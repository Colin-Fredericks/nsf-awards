 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of an experimental program to                       further develop and apply a nuclear method for studies of earth-                surface geologic processes, including studies of continental                    erosion.  The technique is based on in situ production of                       nuclides in rocks by nuclear interaction of cosmic rays.  Since                 the absorption mean free path of cosmic radiation is - 50 cm in                 rocks, and since in situ nuclides, 10Be (half-life, 1.5X106 yrs),               26Al (half-life, 0.7X106 yrs) and 14C (half-life, 5730 yrs) can                 easily be studied in most rocks, one can optimally characterize                 surficial changes in the bracket 2X10-5-6X10-3 cm.yr-1; higher                  and lower rates are accessible using shorter half-life nuclides                 (39Ar, half-life 269 yrs) and stable nuclides, 3He and 21Ne                     respectively.  We have already demonstrated the potential of the                method based on studies of in situ 10Be and 26Al in quartz                      extracted from some 50 rock samples.  We have studied their                     production rates in quartz in natural settings, and also by                     irradiating quartz with high energy particles.  And we have                     studied surface erosion rates and exposure histories of several                 rocks, and also determined the time of formation of the Canyon                  Diablo meteorite crater in Arizona.                                                  The measurements carried out have established the potential                of the nuclear method proposed 2 years ago by us to NSF.  We now                propose to continue our measurements for another period of 2                    years to fully develop and to exploit the potentials of the in                  situ method.  Briefly:  we will include studies of in situ 14C in               quartz; we will obtain further data on isotope production rates;                we will continue studies of surficial erosional rates of selected               surfaces.  In addition, we proposal a set of new applications of                the nuclear method, e.g. studying faulting and history of global                sands.                                                                               The use of multiple in situ nuclides has the now realized                  potential to revolutionize the understanding of surficial                       processes by opening up the vast majority of earth's surface to                 the numerical age control.",
