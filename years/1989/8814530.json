 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. George               Bruening of the University of California, Davis, and Dr. W.L. Gerlach           of the Division of Plant Industry, Commonwealth Scientific and                  Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Canberra.  The                        investigators will analyze the functions of, and evolution of genetic           sequences in, the satellite RNA of the tobacco ringspot virus, which            acts as a parasite on, and therefore biological control for, the                ringspot virus itself.  Mutations of the satellite RNA will further             be studied to assess their ability to replicate, to be incorporated             in, and to protect plants from the effects of other viruses.                                                                                                    The project combines the expertise of the two investigators and their           laboratories.  The U.S. investigator is an expert on the proteins and           nucleic acids involved in the replication of the tobacco ringspot               virus RNA satellite, and has been successful in cloning separately              the substrate and enzyme RNAs of this virus; the Australian                     investigator is an expert in the preparation of mutant satellite RNAs           and transgenic plants.  This research will contribute to fundamental            understanding of how satellite RNAs function, and will guide future             research in biologically engineered resistance to plant viruses.",
