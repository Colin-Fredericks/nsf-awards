 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-year renewal of a U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research            project in robotics between Rajko Tomovic of the Institute of                   Industrial Engineering in Novi Sad and George A. Bekey of the                   University of Southern California's Robotics Institute.  Its                    objective is to develop a new approach to the design and control of             multifingered robot hands using biological principles.  The previous            grant resulted in the development of a robotic hand.  In the next               phase the investigators propose to develop a new, improved model                emphasizing better sensor development, the integration of vision and            tactile control, and development of theoretical models for grasping             and control. This international collaboration which joins two unique            and complementary research groups has proved highly successful over             the last three years and has resulted in a significant list of joint            publications and two conferences.                                                                                                                               This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The grants are            composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to               Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
