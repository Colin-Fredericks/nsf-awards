 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using electrophysiological (patch clamping) techniques, this                    investigator has shown that blue light activates a                              hyperpolarizing proton pump at the guard cell membrane.                         Hyperpolarization creates a gradient for potassium influx,                      presumed to occur through potassium-specific ion channels,                      resulting in water uptake, cell swelling, and stomatal opening.                 The goals of the proposed research are to investigate the                       possibility that blue-light-activation of the proton pump and/or                regulation of potassium channel opening is mediated by the                      phosphatidylinositol (PI) pathway.  Preliminary experiments                     indicate that analogs of diacylglycerol, a component of the PI                  pathway, can enhance light-stimulated opening of stomata in                     epidermal peels.  Patch clamping will be used to determine the                  effects of these and other biochemical regulators of the PI                     pathway on blue-light-stimulated ion pumping and potassium                      channel kinetics of guard cell protoplasts.  The                                electrophysiological response to blue light of guard cells from                 an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant (phi 3-4) will also be                           characterized.  This mutant lacks a phototropic response, and                   also exhibits reduced stomatal opening under blue illumination.                 Blue light mediates a variety of responses in plants, such as                   opening of stomatal pores to allow gas and water exchange,                      bending toward light, and chloroplast development.  The proposed                research will focus on the stomatal response and will contribute                to a clearer understanding of the cellular mechanisms by which                  plants detect and respond to blue light.",
