 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction to College Mathematics, a new advanced high school course          in mathematics developed at the North Carolina School of Science and            Mathematics, will be disseminated to other teachers in a variety of             ways.  It will be prepared for conventional distribution as a                   published book, but particular emphasis will be placed on a variety of          networking techniques to acquaint teachers with the material and                support them during its introduction into use.  One group of teachers           beginning use of the course will use the MATHLINK network to interact           with each other as they try the new material.  Other groups will                attend summer workshops at the school, following which they will form           a SHARETEXT network.  One of the special activities of this networked           group will be to explore use of super calculators in teaching the               course material.  Newsletters will also be used to link the teachers.           Some of the teachers will be selected and trained as leaders to                 introduce the course to more teachers.  The various forms of                    networking will be evaluated to provide guidance which can be used in           planning introduction of new teaching materials and curricula in                general.",
