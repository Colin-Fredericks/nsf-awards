 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Center for Computational Electronics (CCE) will be formed at the              University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and located in the                   Beckman Institute.  The Center shall promote effective use of                   large computational resources and shared experiences for                        simulations including device modeling, process simulations and                  particle Monte Carlo codes, which includes physical details as                  electronic band-structure and scattering mechanisms.  It will                   provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and technical assistance              for matters involving device modeling using supercomputers.  The                Center will not provide directives for research goals nor will it               interfere with the activities of any research group or individual.              However, it will promote collaboration between investigators with               similar interests and make available basic computer codes.                                                                                                      The standardization of material parameters is the second goal of                this Center.  The Center shall collect, organize, and format the                data for the device simulation community and make them available                in cooperation with the Center for Compound Semiconductor                       Microelectronics (NSF-ERC).                                                                                                                                     The Center will support graduate students in a cross-disciplinary               environment with special emphasis on algorithm development for                  solid-state device modeling.  Futhermore, the Center will                       participate in the on-going Visitor's program of the Beckman                    Institute and National Center for Supercomputing Application.                                                                                                   The Center will act as an international contact with research                   groups overseas, to organize periodic workshops, to publish a                   newsletter, and to establish and maintain a strong communication                network for the device simulation researchers.",
