 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help fund the creation of a 12-station, computer-               controlled laboratory for the teaching of labs in Psychobiology,                Hearing, Vision, Human Information Processing, Statistics, and                  Research Methods in the Department of Psychology at Loyola                      University of Chicago.  The twelve stations will be networked so                that software can be shared among the stations and so each can                  access the University's mainframe computer and the library's on-                line data base.  All courses offered in the facility emphasize                  \"hand-on\" approaches to learning, with students required to                     participate in the running of experiments, graphic presentation                 of the data, and data analysis.  The proposal seeks to expand and               supplement the existing facility, which has been used for Lab in                Psychobiology, Lab in Vision, and Lab in Hearing.  Software will                be acquired that turns each of the twelve computer stations into                a fully-functional laboratory, with four of the stations equipped               with measurement, signal-generation, and physiological recording                equipment necessary for the two sensory labs and Lab in                         Psychobiology.  The grantee institution is matching this NSF                    award with funds from non-Federal sources.",
