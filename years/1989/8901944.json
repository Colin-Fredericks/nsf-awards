 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among other mechanisms that have been proposed to control                       microbial cell division cycles (CDC), autonomous biological                     oscillators, ranging from those of the relaxation type to those                 having limit cycle dynamics, provide a possible means of                        integrating the disparate concepts of cell cycle transit, exit                  and arrest.  The long-range goal of this research is to determine               the nature of the oscillator(s) presumed to couple to the CDC and               to generate periodicity of division and other CDC \"landmarks\" (as               well as to underlie circadian rhythmicity in general).  As a                    working hypothesis, based in part on recent findings in the algal               flagellate, Euglena gracilis, it has been proposed that NAD+, the               mitochondrial calcium transport system, calcium-calmodulin, NADP+               phosphatase and NAD+ kinase, and, perhaps, cAMP together could                  constitute a light-entrainable, self-sustaining circadian                       oscillator.  These elements would comprise \"gears\" of the clock                 underlying the overt rhythm of cell division (and other                         variables, or \"hands\") in eukaryotic microorganisms.  The                       approach initiated during earlier work on this project will be                  continued.  First, it will be ascertained whether each successive               element of this proposed control loop exhibits circadian                        rhythmicity in cultures of wild-type Euglena and of an                          achlorophyllous mutant maintained under free-running conditions                 (both in the presence and absence of the well documented rhythm                 of cell division).  Then, in order to determine whether each                    element represents a \"gear\" of the clock, pulses of various drugs               and chemicals which are known to affect these elements will be                  applied.  Direct activation as well as inhibition should each                   generate phase shifts in the biochemical rhythms and in the                     division rhythm.  Particular emphasis will be given to NAD+                     kinase, calcium, and cAMP--putative clock elements that have                    already been explored in some detail.  Ultimately, the goal will                be to delineate the coupling links between the oscillator and the               CDC regulated by it.                                                                                                                                            The goal of this research is to delineate the biochemical steps                 proposed to be the components of a circadian oscillator that may                underlie the rhythm of the cell division cycle in the green alga,               Euglena.",
