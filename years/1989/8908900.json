 "awd_abstract_narration": "Incremental computation is the technique of efficiently maintaining             computed information about a changing object.  This idea is used in             doing semantic checking in programming environments, spreadsheets,              document formatting in WYSIWYG editors and many other applications.             Simply recomputing the information from scratch after each change is            often too inefficient.  Writing explicitly incremental algorithms that          describe how to update the computed information in response to changes          is difficult and error-prone.  Incremental evaluators, given a                  computation to perform, automatically figure out how to correctly and           efficiently update their output when their input changes.                                                                                                       Past work in incremental evaluators has been targeted primarily at              helping to automate the construction of programming environments that           perform such activities as type checking and code generation.  The              techniques used are unsuitable for many of the problems associated with         more advanced programming environments that use concepts such as                inferential or transformational programming, program verification and           other semantically-rich concepts.  Previous work helped to lay the              ground work for a new paradigm of incremental evaluation that shows             promise of being widely useful for such problems.  The goal of this             project is to continue the development of that research and to                  incorporate those ideas into useful tools so that these ideas and tools         can be used by the research community to assist in the development and          exploration of advanced programming environments.",
