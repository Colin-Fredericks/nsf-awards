 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous studies have shown that only a small fraction of the                   infections initiated in legume roots by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia                successfully develop into nodules.  For unknown reasons, most                   initiations terminate prior to completion of the process at all                 stages of development.  The plant hormone ethylene has been                     demonstrated to inhibit nodule formation.  Conversely, studies in               Dr. Peter's laboratory have shown that the number of nodules                    formed on alfalfa roots by Rhizobium meliloti is significantly                  increased by exposure to 1-a-amino-ethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), a                  potent inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis.  Together, these                     results suggest that ethylene biosynthesis may have an important                role in regulating the efficiency of infection and nodule                       formation.  This possibility is consistent with the fact that                   many strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum synthesize a structural                and functional analog of AVG.  This compund, called                             rhizobitoxine, is also a potent inhibitor of ethylene                           biosynthesis in plants.  The PI will examine the role of                        rhizobitoxine and ethylene biosynthesis in regulation of nodule                 development.  Mutants of B. japonicum that have lost the ability                to synthesize rhizobitoxine will be isolated and inoculated onto                host plants to analyze the effects of rhizobitoxine on ethylene                 biosynthesis and nodule development.  The PI will determine                     whether rhizobitoxine and AVG enhance nodule formation by                       increasing the total number of infections or by reducing                        infection abortion.  Genes required for rhizobitoxine synthesis                 will be isolated and characterized.                                                                                                                                                                                                             Although all plants require nitrogen for growth, only a few                     plants (legumes mostly) can take atmospheric nitrogen and convert               it to useable nitrogen compounds.  The present research will                    examine the mechanism by which legumes initiate the nitrogen                    fixation process, allowing those plants to grow without the                     economic and environmental cost associated with nitrogen                        fertilization.",
