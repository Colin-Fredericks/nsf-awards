 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to gain an increased understanding about            biochemical mechanisms insects use to survive the winter.  While many           insect species are known to overwinter in a state of diapause                   (dormancy) our understanding of the biochemical changes that occur              during diapause and permit this long-term survival under adverse                conditions is limited.  Additional knowledge in this area could lead to         new biorational approaches for the control of some pest insects.                                                                                                This proposal focuses on the regulation of the larval diapause of the           southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella. Since lipids serve as           a major reserve nutrient for survival during its diapause, the role of          the lipids-transporting protein, lipophorin, is being examined in               diapause larvae.  Although lipids are known to be released from the fat         body and transported in the hemolymph to sites of utilization during            diapause, little is known about how the process of lipid release from           the body fat occurs.  The synthesis, processing, and release of                 lipophorin from the fat body of non-diapause and diapause larvae will           be compared in a study and should substantially increase knowledge about        the relationship between lipophorin and diapause and provide new                information about how lipid reserves are sequestered and then mobilized         to sustain insects during a prolonged period of dormancy.                       Ultracentrifugal, electrophoretic, immunochemical, radioisotopic, and           electron microscopic techniques will be employed to do the proposed             experiments.",
