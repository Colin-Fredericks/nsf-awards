 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the developmental regulation of essential               aspartate-family amino acid metabolism in chloroplasts of higher                plants.  The hypothesis being tested is that the following                      parameters will be tested to determine how they vary during leaf                development: 1)  the level and intracellular distributions of                   amino acids, 2)  the permeability of the chloroplast envelope to                amino acids and 3)  the activities of key enzymes of essential                  amino acid production.  Purified chloroplasts prepared from                     leaves of barley plants at various stages of development are used               to determine concentrations of amino acids in chloroplasts and                  other cellular compartments throughout development, to measure                  the transport of aspartic acid and the metabolically related                    amino acids, lysine, threonine, methionine and isoleucine, into                 chloroplasts from leaves of varying ages, and to isolate the                    enzymes aspartate kinase, homoserine dehydrogenase and                          dihydrodipicolinate synthetase from plastids of different age                   tissues and relative catalytic activities.  Antibodies also will                be raised to the enzymes and variations in enzyme levels will be                confirmed by immunological methods.                                                                                                                             In the last decade it has become clear that the chloroplast is                  the main site, if not the sole site, for the biosynthesis of the                nutritionally essential aspartate-family amino acids in plant                   leaves.  During the development of plant leaves, the requirement                for the production of these and other amino acids changes.  This                research explores whether the capacity of chloroplasts to                       synthesize the essential aspartate-derived amino acids varies                   during leaf development, so that chloroplast development and its                regulation can be better understood.  These studies will further                provide information regarding the nature and regulation of                      essential amino acid biosynthesis.  Given that deficiency of two                of the aspartate-derived amino acids is a main factor                           contributing to human malnutrition, new information regarding the               regulation of their synthesis is of particular interest.",
