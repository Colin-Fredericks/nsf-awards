 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a test of the hypothesis that periodic, pulsed-potential                electrolysis on an unmodified platinum electrode, or in conjunction             with surface modification by underpotential-deposited tin or                    ruthenium, can significantly increase the cycle-averaged power                  production by lowering the concentration of the poisonous byproduct             adsorbed on the electrode.  For a small fraction of the cycle, the              anode potential is pulsed to a high value at which the surface poison           is oxidatively removed; during the remainder of the cycle, the anode            potential is at a lower, power-producing polarization.  Preliminary             results suggest that the average current may be increased by better             than two orders of magnitude above that obtainable by using steady-             state (DC) control at the same power potential.  The effects of                 pulsed-potential electrolysis in acidic methanol solutions on smooth            and carbon-supported platinum, with and without underpotential-                 deposited tin or ruthenium, are investigated.  Conventional current-            voltage-time electrochemical measurements, are recorded and surface             infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectra are taken.  The production             rates of formaldehyde and formic acid and the dissolution rate of               platinum under the influence of pulsed-potential electrolysis are               determined.                                                                                                                                                     Methanol-air fuel cells are attractive power sources for many                   applications, including electric vehicles, remote installations,                transportation systems, and emergency backups.  Methanol is                     cheaper, more compact, easier to transport, and much safer to use               than hydrogen, which is the principal alternative fuel-cell fuel.               Unfortunately, methanol-air fuel cells using a platinum                         electrocatalyst are self poisoning, severly limiting their                      efficiency.
