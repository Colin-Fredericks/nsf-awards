 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of provocative leads, which concern the effect of                      transposable element insertions in the bz locus of maize on                     the expression of functional (Bz) alleles and which have                        arisen during our research of the past three years will be                      investigated.  The research will involve bz-m13 (an insertion                   of a 2.2 kb defective Spm (dSpm) in the second exon of a Bz                     allele) and the change of state derivatives therefrom as well                   as Bz-wm, which resulted from a Ds insertion 63 base pairs                      upstream from the transcription start site in a BZ allele,                      and the stable Bz revertant from Bz-wm.  The areas in which                     we expect to derive basic information concerning control of                     gene expression are: 1) the effects of perturbation of a 5'                     regulatory sequence, which modulates the quantity of                            UDPglucose:flavonoid glucosyl transferase (UFGT, which is the                   enzyme encoded by Bz alleles) and which probably has a role                     in tissue-specific gene expression as well, by extra                            nucleotide or small deletions resulting from excision of the                    Ds transposable element present in Bz-wm; 2) the role of an                     antisense dSpm message in reducing the transcription or                         processing of the pre-mRNA in the CS12 allele and whether                       this antisense dSpm message is transcribed from the dSpm                        inserted in CS12 or from a dSpm elsewhere in the genome; 3)                     the flexibility of the maize pre-mRNA processing system in                      dealing with transcripts containing a dSpm and the sequence                     signals to which the system responds most strongly; and 4)                      the effect of having two large dSpms inserted within 363 bp                     of each other in exons 1 and 2 of the bz locus in the CS10                      alleleon of gene expression and possible chromosome breakage                    as well as the possibility that the two insertions, which may                   be identical, excise at different times in development when                     an active Spm is present.  If the insertions are shown to be                    identical, sequences flanking the transposable elements may                     be the determining factor.                                                                                                                                      Molecular genetics has made it possible to learn a great deal                   about the structure of transposable elements and their effect                   upon gene expression, usually through insertion into a                          structural gene.  However, it is becoming apparent that more                    subtle interactions maybe occuring between                                      transposable elements and the genomes in which they reside.                     Studies such as this one will help to clarify the situation.",
