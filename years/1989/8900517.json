 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the last twenty years the Gordon Research Conference on                     Chemical Oceanography has provided a major forum for discussions,               exchange of ideas and information.  The central theme of the                    Gordon Conference to be held in August, 1989 is \" Chemical                      Processes in the Ocean.Atmosphere.solid Earth System.\"  As in                   previous years, one of the objectives for the 1989 conference is                to include several foreign scientists in the exchange of                        information.  Significant research in these areas has been                      accomplished by them.  The grant will provide international                     travel funds for foreign scientists to participate in this Gordon               Research Conference on Chemical Oceanography.  Several benefits                 will be realized by the participation of these individuals.  Most               of the marine geochemical research topics to be discussed require               a global perspective which would benefit from increased                         international exchange.  The foreign scientists can bring new                   insights and perspectives to the U.S. participants at the                       Conference.  Approximately 100 U.S. scientists will thus have an                opportunity to establish personal communication with the foreign                scientists.  The foreign participants will acquire in.depth                     information about the U.S. research programs.  It will benefit                  their work and may well lead to expanding future collaborative                  efforts.",
