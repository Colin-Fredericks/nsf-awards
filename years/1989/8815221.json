 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most metozoans are aerobic organisms that die when denied adequate              supplies of molecular oxygen.  However, euryoxic animals, as intertidal         invertebrates like the bivalve Mytilus edulis, tolerate prolonged               periods of hypoxia, or alternating hypoxia and normoxia, with few               apparent difficulties.  Behavioral, physiological and biochemical               responses of aquatic invertebrates to anoxia and hypoxia have been              extensively studied.  Major mechanisms whereby euryoxic invertebrates           survive prolonged lack of oxygen have been elucidated.  This project            will examine the recovery of aerobic conditions from environmental and          functional anoxia and hypoxia.  The recovery to aerobic conditions from         anaerobic states of tissues is important since recent experiments have          demonstrated that a lack of energy production per se may not be the             proximate cause of death in aerobic organisms.  For instance, in mammals        myocardium (heart tissue) and bowel, two tissues especially prone to            damage upon exposure to cycles of anoxia and normoxia, show little              histologic evidence of cell injury or death on exposure to anoxia, even         though ischemia persists for over 60 minutes.  However, when molecular          oxygen is introduced to the tissue during reperfusion, cellular                 structures begin to reveal degeneration typical of moribund tissue.             This research proposal will deal with the role of superoxide radicals,          generated during reperfusion, in reoxygenation injury.  Many intertidal         invertebrates thrive on alternating periods of hypoxia when the tide            ebbs and normoxia when the tide returns.  Stenoxic subtidal species             suffer from similar conditions of alternating hypoxia-normoxia.                 Euryoxic intertidal and stenoxic subtidal species will be compared to           examine resistance and susceptibility to events underlying reperfusion          injury.                                                                                                                                                         This RUI proposal will involve research by three undergraduates each            summer.",
