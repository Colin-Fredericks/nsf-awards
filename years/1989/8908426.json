 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the fundamental mechanisms by                    which human observers perceive and remember the 3D structures of                smoothly curved surfaces.  The project will address two basic                   questions:  First, how are objects in 3-space represented                       mentally; and second, what are the properties of optical                        structure which determine this knowledge perceptually.                                                                                                          It is clear from our perceptual experience that visual images on                the retina provide sufficient information for us to perceive                    adequately the 3D structure of the environment; yet it is equally               clear upon closer reflection that the properties of visual images               seem to have little in common with the properties of real                       objects.  Real objects exist in 3D space and are composed of                    tangible substances such as earth, metal, or flesh, while an                    image of an object is confined to a 2D projection surface and                   consists of nothing more than flickering patterns of light.                     Although the problem of how human observers are able to deal with               this seemingly incommensurate mapping between objects and images                is an ancient one, research in this area has been given a new                   impetus in recent years by attempts to develop artificial visual                systems for robots and prosthetic devices for the blind.  This                  project will attempt to facilitate these efforts by providing a                 more detailed understanding of how similar problems are solved by               the human visual system.                                                                                                                                        In order to model rigorously the processes of 3D form perception,               it is first necessary to define precisely what those processes                  accomplish for us.  Most previous investigations in this area                   have assumed that each visible surface point is encoded                         perceptually in terms of its metric depth relative to the point                 of observation.  This research, in contrast, is designed to                     explore a much wider variety of potential representations.  It                  builds on earlier findings that perceptual judgments of metric                  depth are surprisingly inaccurate and stems from the hypothesis,                supported by the earlier results, that visual knowledge of 3D                   structure may often involve a more abstract form of                             representation in which an observed surface is perceptually                     encoded in terms of its nonmetric properties (e.g., those                       involving ordinal or nominal relations).                                                                                                                        A variety of experiments, using both natural and computer                       generated images, will test this hypothesis.  They will require                 people to make various types of judgments requiring different                   levels of knowledge about 3D structure.  Other experiments will                 identify some of the specific computational mechanisms through                  which perceptual representations of 3D form are generated from                  optical information, and measure the stability of these                         mechanisms over a wide range of viewing conditions.",
