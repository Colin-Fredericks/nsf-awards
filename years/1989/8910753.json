 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using available data, and in collaboration with scholars of the Chinese         Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), the official research arm of the             Chinese government, this study analyzes collective violence events in           over a thousand counties and in around a millenium of China from the            Three Kingdoms period to the Southern Song Dynasty (220-1,279).  When           completed, the project will generate the first machine-readable,                continuous, county-level historical statistical series for over a               millenium in China, not only on collective violence events but also 15          socio-economic explanatory variables like natural calamities, famine            relief, local constructions, level of taxation, number of academic              degree holders, and proximity to administrative capitols.                                                                                                       As the first descriptive task, the study will analyze the level of              magnitude, socio-economic profile, spatial-temporal distribution, as            well as forms and repertoires of collective violence events.  To                account for the above pattern, the researchers will relate levels of            violence to ecological and socio-economic conditions such as the                intensity of calamities, the availability of famine relief, the                 location and size of government troops, as well as the proximity of             mountain refuge, in order to determine their effects on the motive and          opportunity for participation in rebellions and banditry.  Beyond its           intrinsic scientific merit, this first collaborative project between            the Institute of History of CASS and an American scholar will also              enhance CASS' readiness to collaborate with other U.S. social                   scientists.",
