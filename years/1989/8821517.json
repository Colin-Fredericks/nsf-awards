 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research described in this proposal will significantly                      enhance our understanding of the ways in which gender differences               in wages develop over time, with particular attention here to the               onset of this process. A relatively new and comparatively rich                  data set with characteristics not elsewhere available (the 1979                 youth cohort from the National Longitudinal Survey), combined                   with additional information about the organization and industry                 in which the respondent works, will be processed and analyzed.                  Rather than study individuals at one point in time or individuals               at repeated and regular intervals, this research will focus on                  the actual duration of an employee's tenure with each of                        their employers and will study the relative influence of a                      variety of factors on the change in wages that occurs during that               tenure. Among the factors to be studied that are not typically                  considered are firm-specific tenure, a theoretically crucial                    variable in the context of human capital and transaction                        theoretical perspectives, the gender mix specific to the                        occupation and industry category associated with an                             employer, and other firm or industry characteristics such as the                extent of unionization or the degree of product-market dominance                associated with the employer. Alternative theoretical                           expectations about the sources of gender gaps in wages will be                  compared with the statistical results.",
