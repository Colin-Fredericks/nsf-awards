 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Schatz is supported by the Experimental Physical                      Chemistry Program in continuing investigations of spectroscopic                 and structural properties of the ground and excited states of                   various molecular, ionic, mixed-valence, and radical species                    isolated in noble gas matrices at cryogenic temperatures.                       Companion theoretical investigations are used to aid in                         interpreting the measurements.  Systems being investigated                      range from atoms through small clusters and inorganic ring                      compounds to large organometallics.                                                                                                                             The spectroscopic work, emphasizing absorption spectroscopy and                 magnetic circular dichroism, extends from the near infrared                     into the vacuum ultraviolet and permits the assignment of                       transitions, the deduction of ground and excited state                          symmetries and magnetic moments, and the characterization of                    vibronic, electronic, and spin-orbit interactions.  The vacuum                  ultraviolet measurements are being made at the Synchrotron                      Radiation Center of the University of Wisconsin in a new                        experimental area constructed in collaboration with a research                  group at Wisconsin.  Theoretical work on mixed-valence systems                  extends earlier effort in Schatz's group and emphasizes the                     properties of extended linear chain systems.",
