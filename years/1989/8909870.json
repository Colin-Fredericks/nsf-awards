 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical models of the atmosphere provide several                         prognostic thermodynamic and state variables such as temperature,               humidity and liquid water.  These grid box mean quantities must                 be utilized in algorithms to generate the longwave and shortwave                radiation fields necessary for the computation of the diabetic                  heating in the energy equation.  This research involves the                     development of these algorithms, particularly as they pertain to                the treatment of clouds, since that has been recognized as a                    weakness in current numerical models of the Earth's atmosphere.                      The primary tools that will be use in the execution of this                project are:  (a) classical, rigorous and approximate methods                   for the treatment of radiative transfer in plane parallel                       absorbing and scattering media, (b) a Monte-Carlo model of                      shortwave radiative transfer through horizontally inhomogeneous                 clouds, (c) thermodynamic and cloud microphysical data, along                   with satellite overpass observations obtained from recent field                 experiments, (d) a one-dimensional version of an atmospheric                    general circulation model (GCM) that will act as a column test                  bed for the parameterizations, and (e) the GCM itself, to be used               to determine the sensitivity of the model to changes in the                     radiation algorithms.  Past experience with the parameterization                of radiation in numerical models will form the base from which                  this effort will be launched.                                                        This research is important because it attempts to improve                  the way climate models represent cloud-radiation processes- a                   current weakness in all climate models.",
