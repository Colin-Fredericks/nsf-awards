 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to improve the physics laboratory equipment            and instrumentation at North Idaho College in support of a program to           develop a contemporary high quality physical science curriculum at the          undergraduate level.  The opportunity for students' active involvement          in a laboratory setting is essential and the absence of modern                  equipment will adversely affect their attitudes to physics courses.  In         order to provide a contemporary laboratory capability, the equipment            includes computer interface units, smart pulley system and sonic range          finder, wave analysis system, precision interferometer, thermodynamics          quantitative measurement system, equipment to measure charge to mass            ratio, Franck/Hertz critical potentials and electron diffraction, and           an electron spin resonance experimental system.  The project will               provide new and revised laboratory experiments and lecture                      demonstrations.  In addition, it will introduce this capability across          other academic disciplines and support a program designed to improve            quality of mathematics and science instruction for local teachers in            grades 7-12.  The college will match the award with an equal amount.",
