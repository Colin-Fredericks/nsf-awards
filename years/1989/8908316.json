 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at the production of superconducting ceramic             powders by the aerosol decomposition method.  In this technique gas-            borne liquid drops containing soluble compounds of the desired metals           are dried, heated in furnace to decompose the compounds, and then               further heated in oxygen to achieve the desired level of oxygen                 addition.  The research will address problems of composition                    segregation which may arise if one of the metal species is                      sufficiently volatile or if oxygen diffusion is insufficiently rapid.           It will study methods of controlling particle microstructure such as            shape and porosity.  Bulk and thin film samples of the particles so             produced will be characterized as to their superconductive properties           by the Los Alamos National Laboratory for High Temperature                      Superconductors.                                                                                                                                                The aerosol decomposition method offers a flexible technique for                producing particles of controlled size, shape and composition and so            could contribute substantially to the engineering developments needed           to make superconducting a practical reality.",
