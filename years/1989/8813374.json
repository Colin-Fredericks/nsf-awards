 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of metal ions on the hydrolysis of a series of                      carboxyl substituted esters and amides will be studies to allow                 a chemical assessment of the mechanistic possibilities for the                  metalloenzyme carboxypeptidase A.  In this work all the                         currently recognized will be investigated in systems of know                    mechanism so that a quantitative evaluation may be made of the                  effects on the rate constants of:  1\\0 the identity of the                      metal ion, 2\\0 the strength of binding of the metal ion to                      either the carbonyl oxygen or the leaving group, 3) the pka of                  the leaving group, and 4) the stearic fit of the carboxyl                       group.                                                                                                                                                          In conjunction with the chemical work a kinetic investigation                   of carboxypeptidase A will be carried out employing new types                   of substrates with which the leaving group can be varied.                       Conformational effects will be investigated in stopped-flow                     studies and in inhibition studies.  The later experiments will                  give information on the nature of the sites in which esters,                    peptides, and inhibiting the enzyme, because these techniques                   have proven successful in other systems and because of her                      experience in protein work, funding is recommended.",
