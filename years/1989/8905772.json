 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Soffer's project is concerned with the spectral                  and scattering theory of hamiltonian systems. It includes as a                  major part the study of N-body long range potential systems and                 quasiparticle dynamics such as spin waves. Related problems will                also be tackled, including the spectral theory of time-dependent                hamiltonians and multichannel nonlinear scattering. It is                       expected that this work will provide a rigorous basis for some                  important concepts in physics as well as new mathematical                       techniques of analyzing the asymptotic behavior of solutions of                 partial differential equations.                                                      The general idea here is the use of sophisticated                          mathematics to model the behavior of physical systems, especially               those involving several interacting particles. (These might be                  electrons interacting by Coulomb forces, or at the opposite                     extreme, stars interacting gravitationally.) Such a system may                  variously be described by a system of partial differential                      equations, or by an operator (called the hamiltonian) on a space                of functions that represent the possible physical states. There                 is in principle a quite straightforward relationship between the                hamiltonian and the time evolution of the system. Working this                  out for a given class of hamiltonians in sufficient detail to                   make strong qualitative statements about what happens to the                    system in the long run is a major analytical task, however, and                 the focus of the mathematical research for this project.",
