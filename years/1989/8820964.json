 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this one-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research project                     in organic chemistry between Bozo Plesnicar, University of                      Ljubljana and Glen Russell and Tom Barton, Iowa State                           University and J.C. Martin, Vanderbilt University, the                          investigators will study the chemistry of organic saturated                     compounds, polyoxy and peroxy.  This topic is of continuing                     interest in organic chemistry as peroxides are widely used                      in idustrial chemical processes (oxidants, bleaching agents,                    polymerization initiators).                                                                                                                                     This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution  in Yugoslavia, but                        include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
