 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three data acquisition and signal processing systems will be                    provided to implement a novel improvement in undergraduate                      instrumentation laboratories.  The new idea addresses the need to               teach digital data acquisition and signal processing techniques                 such as: concepts of dynamic system response, data sampling,                    leakage, aliasing, transformation, and others to                                mechanical-engineering undergraduate students.  In the newly                    designed instrumentation curricula, spectrum analyzers are being                used much like oscilloscopes were used previously.  This new                    approach to undergraduate instrumentation permits students to                   learn techniques currently used in industry.  These principles                  will be taught not only in the class room environment but also                  through newly designed laboratory experiments in two undergraduate              instrumentation courses.  The equipment will provide the                        laboratories with three work stations consisting of personal                    computer controllers, data acquisition and signal processing                    peripherals, and appropriate signal conditioning and excitation                 hardware.",
