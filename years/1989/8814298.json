 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of                      Cincinnati has initiated a major effort to increase its research                in molecular biology.  The department has been awarded an                       academic challenge grant from the state of Ohio to hire new                     faculty members in the areas of plant molecular biology,                        molecular evolution and molecular parasitology.  A fourth new                   faculty member in molecular genetics is funded by the University                of Cincinnati.  Three of these faculty members are now at the                   University of Cincinnati initiating their research projects.  The               objective of this proposal is to set up a departmental facility                 for DNA synthesis, sequencing and analysis to enhance the                       research of the new faculty and to introduce DNA sequencing and                 analysis to graduate students and faculty who have not previously               used these techniques.  The requested funds will enable the                     department to acquire an oligonucleotide synthesizer,                           ultracentrifuge rotors and a computer system for DNA sequence                   analysis.  The University of Cincinnati will provide funding for                DNA sequencing gel apparatuses, power supplies and other small                  equipment for DNA sequencing as well as a technician to operate                 and maintain the equipment.  This facility will allow all members               of the department access to current DNA sequencing technology.",
