 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Humphreys is investigating the ways in which computer                       simulation methods can and cannot be adequately accommodated                    within existing philosophical accounts of scientific method.  He                is placing particular emphasis on the relationships between laws                and specific conditions, on the role of analogical reasoning in                 the construction of simulation models, and the effects that the                 absence of an explicit deductive structure in the models has on                 our understanding of these models.  The research will focus                     during the first part of the grant period on models in physics                  and astronomy, especially those that use Monte Carlo estimation                 techniques.  During the second half of the grant period, he will                focus on identifiability issues in social science models.  While                carrying out the research, he will make various points of                       connection with current work in cognitive science that uses                     simulation methods.",
