 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal seeks to enhance the teaching of science using                     Space Science as a vehicle which is both appealing and                          inherently interdisciplinary.  This three-year program will                     train 120 middle school teachers from the Western                               Massachusetts area in a model program which emphasizes a                        disciplinary approach to the subject and the development of                     an ongoing support mechanism which will enable teachers to                      work together in keeping their teaching current and insure a                    long-term continuation of their educational process.  The                       program consists of the following components:  (i)                              preliminary spring meetings; (ii) a 3-week summer institute;                    (iii) an academic year follow-up program; (iv) support                          mechanisms including a bulletin-board network, a part-time                      space science resource teacher at the Children's Museum at                      Holyoke, and an academic alliance of middle school science                      organized by the SPACENET alumni.                                                                                                                               An amount equivalent to 24.3% of the NSF award is being                         contributed by the University of Massachusetts, Five                            Colleges, and other sources.",
