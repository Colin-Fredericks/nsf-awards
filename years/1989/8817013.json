 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to investigate fluid-rock interaction and mass                  transfer rates in the San Joaquin basin.  The work will test                    models of fluid flux in sedimentary basins including: compaction                driven flow, thermal driven convection, and meteoric recharge.                  Our approach is to use 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd ratios as                      isotopic tracers, in combination with our present understanding                 of diagenetic reactions, to determine calcium mobility in the                   basin.  We will compare calcium sinks (carbonate and laumontite                 cements) with potential calcium sources including:  marine                      biogenetic carbonate, detrital Ca-smectite, and Ca-plagioclase.                 Preliminary work suggests that Ca-plagioclase is the most likely                source for calcium in calcite cements.                                               We believe that this study will offer a unique insight into                basin diagenetic processes, and owing to the well-constrained                   geology in this area, we believe it is ideal for a study of this                type.  Our success will depend on being able to recognize                       isotopic \"fingerprints\" for each potential source, to be able to                reliably measure isotopic ratios in cements, and to be able to                  predict timing of reactions.  Our work to date strongly indicates               that Sierran plagioclase is the only Sr isotopic source with                    ratios low enough to account for those observed in cements at                   North Coles Levee, a Miocene reservoir we have examined in                      detail.  In addition, dissolution of plagioclase would uniquely                 account for the decreasing ratios observed in progressively                     modified modern pore waters of the basin.                                            We propose to extend these studies at North Coles Levee into               a basinwide scale.  To test the hypothesis of plagioclase sourced               Ca, we propose to examine four areas of varying feldspar                        alteration:  1) areas with unaltered plagioclase, 2) with                       abundant plagioclase dissolution, 3) with abundant plagioclase                  albitization, and 4) with K-feldspar dissolution but without                    plagioclase alteration.  In each area we will measure isotopic                  values for cements and potential Ca sources including                           plagioclase.  Pore waters will also be measured to monitor the                  effects of fluid-rock interaction on Sr isotopic ratios.  Mass                  transfer rates will be calculated for each area where possible.                 Finally by cooperative research with other groups we plan to                    compare our estimates of mass transfer with those predicted by                  various hydrologic models.  We believe this controlled, multi-                  disciplinary project has great potential for understanding mass                 transfer on a basin-wide scale.",
