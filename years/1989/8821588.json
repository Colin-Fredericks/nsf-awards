Sweigart of Brown                   University will investigate some reactions of organometallic                    compounds with the specific goals of (1) developing new                         synthetic routes to important organic molecules, (2) probing                    the detailed mechanistic pathways for electrophile-nucleophile                  combinations so that predictions of pi-hydrocarbon activation                   become possible, and (3) determining the feasibility of                         examining these reactions electrochemically by using low                        temperature voltammetric and steady-state ultramicroelectrode                   techniques. The mechanistic studies are applicable to acid-base                 reactions in general and may have theoretical consequences well                 beyond organometallic chemistry in the possible discovery of an                 universal nucleophilic reactivity scale for such reactions.                     Pioneering experimental and theoretical applications of                         ultramicroelectrodes are proposed that should aid in making                     this methodology available to all chemists.                                                                                                                     The reactions of electrophilic organometallic complexes of                      manganese, iron, rhenium and tungsten containing coordinated                    pi-hydrocarbons such as arenes, alkenes and alkynes will be                     examined. The primary reaction is attack by nucleophiles (with                  carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus or hydrogen donor atoms) at the                    activated pi-hydrocarbon to produce functionalized molecules.                   The proposed study will provide general routes to disubstituted                 cis- and trans-cyclohexadienes as well as novel                                 endofunctionalized cyclohexadienyl complexes.",
