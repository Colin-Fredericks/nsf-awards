The problem now is to integrate small computer tools                   to take best advantage of technological advances.  This project                 will establish efficient methods for commercial software to                     enter, manipulate, analyze, and print phonetic data on American                 English from the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South                       Atlantic States (LAMSAS).  The Principal Investigator has                       applied commercial software to display and print phonetic data,                 and has designed a data structure for phonetic data with a                      commercial database program.  The 1.5 million responses of the                  LAMSAS data-base require fast, accurate methods to enter                        phonetic data, now difficult to keyboard.  Efficient methods                    will be developed to divide extremely variable strings of                       phonetics into classes in order to correlate the classes                        (numerically coded) with the characteristics of LAMSAS                          informants with a commercial advanced statistics package.                       Finally, methods will be designed to integrate the output of                    word processing, database, and statistical software to generate                 camera-ready copy for publication.  The methods will be of                      immediate use to linguists for research on phonetics because                    all equipment and software is readily available at low cost and                 all procedures are readily portable for database research.",
