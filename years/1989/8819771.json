 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Isthmus of Panama was uplifted several million years                   ago, leading to isolation of the eastern Pacific and western                    Caribbean marine realms, and interchange between the terrestrial                biotas of North and South America.  Dr. Alan Graham has been                    actively sampling and interpreting deposits of fossil pollen from               Central America, with the goal of interpreting the climatic and                 vegetational history of the region before and during the uplift                 of the Ishthmus.  He now proposes to extend his earlier sampling                of Miocene strata in Panama to both older and younger formations                in Jamaica, Guatemala, and Costa Rica.                                               The proposed research will expand greatly our understanding                of this critical episode in earth history.  These pollen records                will lead to better reconstructions of the climatic and                         ecological history of the region, and will shed new light on how                and why certain plant and animal groups migrated across the                     Ishthmus while others did not.  Dr. Graham will continue toward                 his eventual goal of understanding the evolutionary history of                  the biotic communities we now see in the tropics of the New                     World.",
