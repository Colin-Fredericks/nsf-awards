 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to formulate, design, and evaluate            composite arithmetic algorithms using on-line approach, so that the             resulting algorithms are better suited for VLSI and are more adaptable          to the requirements of application-specific parallel systems for                numeric computations.  This research combines theoretical,                      experimental, and methodological aspects to develop and adapt                   algorithms or the basic operations and to combine the basic operations          into more complex functions. Design modules are being developed in              VLSI, which are then incorporated into application-specific systems.            The focus is on matrix computations that are pervasive in signal                processing applications.                                                                                                                                        On-line arithmetic is characterized by (i) digit-serial operations,             (ii) the most-significant-digit-first mode in all operations, (iii) no          carry propagation, and (iv) highly modular organization.  Previous              research of the principal investigators have shown that the on-line             approach is very promising.  The proposed study relating aspects on             algorithm formulation,constraints of VLSI implementation, and computer          architecture is essential to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of such         an approach.  Support is strongly recommended.  Support of two                  undergraduate students is also recommended under the Research                   Experience for Undergraduates program. The undergraduate students               benefit by experimenting with various models of on-line arithmetic and          implementing the designs in VLSI.",
