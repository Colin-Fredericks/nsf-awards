 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1985 and 1986, the Educational Testing Service (ETS) conducted               a study to determine the persistence of minority students in the                study of mathematics, engineering, and scientific in college.                   These students were selected because they had indicated that they               wanted to major in MSE fields and had scored 550 or better on                   their SAT (Math).  In 1897, ETS sent a questionnaire to the                     approximately 5,000 students who had persisted in their field of                initial choice and asked: \"What advice would you give to boys and               girls just starting high school, if they want to succeed in                     college as math, science, engineering or premed majors, and                     pursue careers in MSE fields?\"  The response of the students was                enthusiastic, and ETS found an unusual amount of wisdom in the                  advice.                                                                                                                                                         This project will allow for the production and dissemination of a               booklet containing the responses from the minority students.  The               ETS has analyzed the responses, and constructed a set of code                   catagories.  The advice of the older students will be selected so               that all five catagories are represented.  The booklet will be                  distributed to high schools in the United States.//",
