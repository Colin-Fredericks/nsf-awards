 "awd_abstract_narration": "Myxococcus exhibits striking coordinated movements involving                 thousands of individual cells.  Myxobacterial cells move by                     gliding, a form of translocation restricted to surfaces.  Despite               the complexity of their movement, myxobacteria have the                         structural, chemical, and genetic simplicity of Gram-negative                   bacteria.  How myxobacteria glide, and how they communicate with                each other to coordinate their gliding, are the subjects of this                research.  Mutants that had lost the ability to glide from a                    single mutational step were all found to be defective in                        producing the same protein, mg1A, which implies an important role               for this protein in gliding.  Antibodies have been raised to mg1A               protein, and will be used to find the number, location, and                     distribution of this important gliding protein in the cells.  How               production of mg1A protein is regulated has been determined by                  study of its messenger RNA.  Another gene, called tgl, is used to               control gliding by cell - cell interactions.  Tgl is necessary                  for socially motile cells which move when they are within a                     cell's length of another cell. Tgl is also necessary for a cell                 contact dependent stimulation of motility whereby cells in a                    mixture of two different nonmotile mutants can move transiently.                The location of tgl protein in cells, and what happens to the                   protein during stimulation, will be determined.                                                                                                                 The highly organized movements of myxobacteria are in some ways                 clearly analogous to morphogenetic movements of cells during                    development of multicellular animals.  The structural and genetic               simplicity of the myxobacterial system allows these phenomena to                be studied more readily than in more complex biological systems.                The results of these studies are expected to shed some light on                 general principals underlying cellular mass migrations.",
