 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment is an NC turning center of realistic                        industrial size.  It will be used for fundamental studies of the                effect of chatter on tool wear, and to investigate the mechanisms               responsible for the process damping which improves the stability                of machining at low speeds.  There is as yet very little                        information available about the relationship between chatter and                tool wear.  A significant effect on tool wear would indicate a                  need to reexamine the current operations in industries where                    chatter is accepted as a fact of life (e.g. pocket milling                      aluminum airframe panels) and to consider the chatter avoidance                 techniques already available.  It may be possible to use the                    results of the process damping investigations to deliberately                   introduce process damping and thereby increase the stability of                 existing operations significantly (several times).                                   Two sensor control algorithms will be developed and                        experimentally verified.  One is a method for chatter avoidance                 by automatically selecting optimally stable speeds, and the other               is a technique for chatter and tool breakage detection.                         Additionally, simulation models will be developed and verified to               be used as aids in determining the quality of the turning                       operation during the NC programming stage (programming for                      quality milling).  Primarily, these investigations are directed                 toward operations where machining quality prediction abilities                  would reduce the time typically required for program                            verification, while tool breakage detection using the microphone                would provide a less expensive alternative to existing force and                acoustic emission schemes.",
