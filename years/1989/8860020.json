 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased demand and overfished resources have prompted                    the development of an abalone farming industry in the US and                    abroad.  Expansion of this food industry has been hampered by                   the slow growth of these mollusks.  It is proposed that a                       faster growing red abalone (Haliotis rufescans) be produced                     by the induction of triploidy.  Results from published reports                  on other molluscan species infer that chromosomal manipulation                  in abalone should create sexually sterile animals which                         channel energy away from gonad production into enhanced meat                    and shell growth.  Triploidy may also produce secondary                         benefits such as improved meat quality and adaptability to                      a greater range of environmental conditions.  Chemical and                      thermal shock will be tested for their ability to induce                        triploidy in abalone eggs, and for their effects on post-                       treatment survival.  Increased growth rates should increase                     profitability and stimulate further industry expansion.  The                    techniques developed in this work could be used on technically                  unsophisticated farms using simple equipment.",
