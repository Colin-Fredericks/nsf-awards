 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to teach students in introductory                   programming classes to solve complex programming problems in an                 important domain--social science.  Complexity in these problems will be         dealt with by designing and evaluating case studies that address valid          programming problems from social science.  How programmers store and            reuse knowledge will be communicated by creating a \"library\" of                 programming knowledge in hypermedia.  The case studies will illustrate          how programmers combine principles from the knowledge domain of social          science and constraints of the programming environment and describe how         the library of this knowledge can be used to design solutions to complex        problems.                                                                                                                                                       To accomplish these goals and take full advantage of the technologies of        the of the 1990s, specially we plan to (a) examine how experts attain           and use knowledge of programming to solve complex problems in social            science, (b) use hypermedia to create a library of model problem                solutions accessible to  students, (c) use principles from                      apprenticeship learning to devise case studies usable in real settings          that teach students skills to use the library to design solutions to            complex social science problems, (d) teach students to solve complex            social science problems using a non-procedural language well-suited to          the problem demands, and (e) meet the needs of students underrepresented        in programming classes including women.",
