 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Earth Science, University of Northern Iowa, will              expand and broaden opportunities for undergraduate projects and                 research by the acquisition of equipment for fluorescence microscopy.           Although widely used in the biological and medical fields, fluorescence         microscopy has received only limited use in the geosciences.  Recent            studies, however, document the value of fluorescence microscopy in              recognizing depositional textures in dolomitized and recrystallized             carbonate rocks.  Acquisition of a research-quality petrographic                microscope, equipped for fluorescence studies and photography, will             open up new fields of investigation at the institution.  Undergraduate          students will be able to systematically tackle questions dealing with           the environment of deposition of the dolomitized strata which are so            abundant in the state.  Geology students enrolled in stratigraphy and           sedimentation will be introduced to fluorescence microscopy.                    Subsequently, interested students will utilize fluorescence microscopy          further in undergraduate research projects designed to decipher the             depositional history of dolomitized strata.  Undergraduate research is          a requirement for the Bachelor of Science degree.  In addition, a               number of Bachelor of Arts majors select undergraduate research as an           elective in their programs.                                                                                                                                     The University will match the award with an equal amount of funds.",
