 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a research program that investigates key                   issues in the design of knowledge based systems for use in                      Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (AUV) systems.  It defines an effort                to understand some of the problems associated with utilizing                    knowledge based systems in real time systems.  The purpose of                   this research is to implement a framework for further development of            real time knowledge based systems.  this framework will be                      realized with the development of an operating system and system                 architecture applicable to time constrained symbolic systems.                   The main product of this effort will be a new symbolic processing               operating system which will be used as the foundation for current and           future development in intelligent time constrained systems.                     The proposed research addressed the underlying issues which lead                to capable real time systems.  Knowledge based techniques will be               advanced by first addressing the design from the vantage of                     operating systems and system architecture.  The proposed work                   will take advantage of current real time operating system                       technology. Once the architecture a and application is chosen it will be        implemented on the MSEL integrated symbolic numeric system residing on          the Ironics IV 3204 32 bit CPU board for VME bus.                               The testing phase will include the determination and measurement                of key real time system parameters as well as benchmarks.  At                   this point there are no clear measures of performance other than                simplistic cycle rate determinations. For this reason a task is                 included to determine useful metrics for evaluating time                        constrained knowledge-based systems.  In the final phase of this                work we will evaluate the results to determine performance                      limitations and propose enhancements to the system.",
