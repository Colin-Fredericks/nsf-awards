 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with the degree to which                selection of males for mating by females may limit members of a                 population from achieving those traits that might best adapt them               to the rigorous physical and competitive environment in which                   they exist.  The work is based on the premise that whereas a                    female's success is related to her ability to compete for food,                 a male's success is determined by his ability to compete for                    females.  These asymmetries may lead to selection of different                  characteristics in males versus females which ultimately will                   increase the variability of traits exhibited in the population,                 moving the mean away from behavioral and morphological                          characteristics that might be best suited for the environment.                  The investigators will test this premise in a population of                     spiders occupying an extremely harsh physical environment where                 there is strong selection for individuals that: 1) \"recognize\"                  the value of particular habitat feature: and 2) successfully                    obtain and dependthese superior foraging sites against intrusion                by other members of their own species population.  Spiders, by                  their nature, have proven to be excellent tools for study of this               and other ecological and evolutionary problems.  They are readily               and adequately sampled because they are present in large numbers                and are not disturbed by the human observer.  They also can be                  easily manipulated without disruption of their \"natural\"                        behavior.  This is a major problem when utilizing vertebrate                    subjects.  Finally, as a group, spiders perform many of the                     behaviors and exhibit adaptations characteristic of the                         vertebrates, but in a less complex and, thus, more analyzable and               quantifiable form.",
