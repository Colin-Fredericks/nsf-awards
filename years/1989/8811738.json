 "awd_abstract_narration": "By means of a law of large numbers and central limit                       theorem, the author wishes to compare stochastic and                            deterministic models of a chemical reaction with diffusion.  The                proposed methods will exploit the smoothing properties of the                   relevant contraction semigroup more fully than previous work and                reflect underlying large deviation behavior.  The methods                       developed can be used for proving regularity results for                        stochastic evolution equations having a discontinuous and non                   Gaussian martingale term.  The stochastic model is to be                        reformulated as a measure valued diffusion.                                          This investigator works in the field of probability, in the                area of stochastic processes.  He is working on models of                       chemical reactions which have been actively investigated by other               researchers for the last 15 years.  His results will not only                   significantly aid in the understanding of these reactions but                   will also contribute to the set of tools mathematicians employ in               attacking certain problems.",
