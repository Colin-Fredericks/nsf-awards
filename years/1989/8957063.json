 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physical conditions and processes that occur in quasars                     (QSOs), active galaxies, supernovae, and X-ray binary stars                     will be investigated from an observational point of view,                       coupled with theoretical calculations.  Much of the research                    will involve the development of sophisticated image                             processing data analysis techniques, as well as accurate                        numerical models of accretion disks and ionized gases.  In                      some cases the methods may become applicable to many non-                       astronomical research areas.                                                                                                                                    One of the main goals is to determine whether nearby galaxies                   are in any way related to luminous QSOs.  It is generally                       believed that QSOs derive their energy from matter accreting                    onto supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies.  If                   so, it is likely that at least some local galaxies are \"dead\"                   QSOs, and therefore harbor such black holes in their nuclei.                    Similarly, the QSO phenomenon may occur at a low intrinsic                      level in some galaxies even if thy were not luminous QSOs in                    the past.  High-quality optical spectra of the nuclei of 500                    bright, nearby galaxies, observed during the past few years                     will be analyzed.  After careful removal of the underlying                      stellar continuum and absorption lines, faint emission lines                    are usually visible.                                                                                                                                            The study of supernovae (SNe) will also be carried out.  A                      long series of photometric optical spectra of every bright SN                   accessible to northern telescopes will be used in statistical                   studies (progenitor stars, correlations with environment,                       etc.).  Comparison with the predictions of theoretical models                   should shed light on the chemical composition and excitation                    mechanism of the expanding gas as well as on the nature of                      the stellar explosion.                                                                                                                                          There will be an attempt to determine the physical                              characteristics of X-ray binaries, which often show                             interesting parallels with active galactic nuclei.  One of                      the most important questions is whether the central object in                   SS 433 is a black hole or a neutron star.  The nature of the                    accretion disk, and the mechanism by which it undergoes                         forced precession, are also outstanding problems that should                    be solved.",
