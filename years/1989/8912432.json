 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this project is to better understand                   the development of synoptic scale weather systems, which may                    ultimately lead to improved weather forecasts.  The principal                   investigator's previous work has focused how the structure of                   the flow, or \"initial value\", contributes to subsequent                         development of perturbations.  He will extend this research                     along two lines.  The first thrust is to continue his                           investigations into the physical mechanism(s) responsible for                   cyclogenesis;  the other is to explore the predictability of                    large scale atmospheric flows.                                                       Observational evidence suggests that deformation, as well                  as shear, in the background atmospheric flow plays an important                 role for certain types of cyclogenesis.  The principal                          investigator already has shown the effect of shear in the                       background flow on the energetic development of cyclones.  He                   will extend this work to look at the effect of confluence and                   difluence on perturbations in the flow.                                              While the subject has been studied extensively,                            theoretical estimates of the predictability of the atmosphere                   still vary widely as do the results from numerical weather                      prediction experiments.  The reason appears to be variability                   in the predictability of the flow regimes, that is, certain                     types of flows are inherently more predictable than others.                     The principal investigator will explore the growth of error in                  numerical models and attempt to distinguish between those flows                 which are predictable and those which are not as a function of                  flow characteristics.",
