 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to aid in the establishment of a major         experimental research and educational facility to further strengthen            existing efforts and support research in five major areas of                    computational investigations:                                                                                                                                   1.   Software Engineering Environments and Tools including program                   verification, reusability theory, and automated software design                 methodologies;                                                             2.   Application Support Tools for mathematical modeling, computer                   aided design and manufacturing, statistical analysis, signal                    processing,control systems, and simulations;                               3.   Theoretical Research including fault-tolerant computing, parallel               processing computational algorithms, network tool design,                       simulations on distributive system and parallel and                             multiprocessing models.                                                    4.   Artificial Intelligence including work on knowledge based systems,              neural networks, symbolic computation and robotics; and                    5.   Laboratory Environments including end-user environments, human                  factors prototyping, and ergonomics.                                                                                                                       The facility might also be a central clearing house for internal and            external faculty-development activities and for managing student                research work.  Centralized efforts could also promote additional               curriculum development activities while controlling the use, budgetary          activities, and further processing of additional research interests.",
