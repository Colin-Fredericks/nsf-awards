 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will focus on two aspects of the regulation                  of genes for bioluminescence (lux) from Vibrio harveyi: 1) the                  density-dependent control of transcription; and 2) the                          mechanism which generates luminous variants.  The regulatory                    genes controlling expression of luminescence are not linked to                  the operon encoding enzymes for light production and have not                   been cloned.  However, using transposon mutagenesis of the                      native organism, we have identified the \"lost locus\" encoding                   regulatory function(s).  This unlinked second region, now                       marked by transposon insertion, will be cloned and the genetic                  circuitry analyzed: the specific lux genes and transcriptional                  units will be identified and sequenced; the Lux functions will                  be inferred from analysis of mutant phenotypes; and                             transcriptional control of genes in this region will be                         examined by using gene fusions.  Regulation is known to involve                 a pheromone-like substance called autoinducer, and genetic                      analysis should yield insight into mechanisms bacteria use to                   perceive and react to their environment.  Luminous variants of                  V. harveyi arise spontaneously at high frequencies and  can                     change back to the original or new luminous forms.  Indication                  that changes in genome organization correlate with luminescence                 variation has been obtained by using a hybridization probe                      representing part of the second locus mentioned above in                        Southern blot analysis of DNA from luminous variants.  We will                  proceed to clone the entire region of DNA  involved in                          variation and define precisely the changes in DNA structure                     which affect the intensity of light emission.                                                                                                                   Luminous variation could be one manifestation of a general                      process for creating the diversity of phenotypes needed for                     survival in the varied and changing circumstances encountered                   in the ocean, and studying this phenomenon could enrich our                     understanding of how genome plasticity generates diversity.",
