 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this two-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative                research project in low temperature physics between Janez Seliger               of the Josef Stefan Institute and V. Hugo Schmidt ot Montana State              University, is to obtain a fundamental understanding of superionic              conductivity and ferroelectric and ferroelastic materials and                   systems using NMR and NMQ techniques. This work should                          substantially advance knowledge of structure of ferroelectrics.                                                                                                 This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint             fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and                     Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually               by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are              made to the principal Yugoslav institute.  Dollar funds are                     included for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav               scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
