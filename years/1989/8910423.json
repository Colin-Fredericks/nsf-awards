 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate objective of this work is to provide a systematic and              quantitative model that can be used to engineer the synthesis of metal          oxides from solutions of organometallic precursors.  In the present             work, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is coupled with             chromatography and solids characterization to learn details of the              kinetics of the key chemical reactions involved in sol-gel synthesis            as functions of the nature and concentration of the (electrolyte)               catalyst.  Teactant structure, solvent properties, reaction                     reversibility, diffusion limitations, and multicomponent reactions are          also addressed.  Data obtained are incorporated into existing                   quantitative models of sol-gel reactions.                                                                                                                       In principle, ceramics, glasses and gels can be made with tailored              chemical properties, shape or mechanical behavior using sol-gel                 ceramic synthesis technology, in which organometallic procursos in              solution are polymerized to metal oxides.  Realization of this                  capability depends upon improved quantitative understanding of the              chemistry of these systems.",
