 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops models of marriage markets and their                     interdependence with labor market and socioeconomic                             conditions. It examines trends in marriage, cohabitation, and                   divorce in the United States since the 1960s, and assesses                      the effects of changing labor market and marital                                opportunities on these trends.  It focuses on the dramatic                      downswing in rates of marriage among young persons,                             particularly for blacks, a trend that includes not only                         greater delay in marriage but also increases in the                             proportion of persons who will never marry; as well as on                       increased marital disruption and cohabitation among unmarried                   persons. It examines the effects of the changing labor market                   opportunities of young adults, including the sharply                            increasing rates of joblessness for black youths and the                        gradually improving relative socioeconomic position.  The                       research tests alternative arguments of how labor market                        trends have affected marriage, including those that stress                      the increased economic hardship of some men and those that                      stress the increased economic independence of women.  This                      research is important in that it will serve to explain                          fundamental changes in the institution of marriage in                           American Society.",
