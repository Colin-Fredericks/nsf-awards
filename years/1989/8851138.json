 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Museum of Natural History proposes to design and build a           new permanent 9,000-square-foot Hall of Human Biology and Evolution over        a three-year period.  The exhibit is to start out with human biology and        then move smoothly to human evolution and the fossil record and other           evidences of early humans.  The new exhibit will range from the                 molecular/genetic level to the emergence of human beings, and will              include archeological excavations and findings, reconstruction and              discussion of humanoids, early human evolution, human structure and             function, and human diversity.  In addition to stimulating the interests        of visitors (2.7 million in 1986-87) in human biology and evolution             through the use of traditional and interactive technology, the new              exhibit program will provide curriculum supplement for elementary and           high school classes and teacher-training guides and workshops to assist         in the integration of the exhibition materials into classroom studies.          The primary educational goal is to give the widest possible audience a          concrete sense of where and how the human animal fits in the natural            world through examination of the traits that we share with all creatures        and those that are peculiar to humans.  The exhibit promises further            contribution by bridging the current exhibits on animal life and those          on the rich ethnological collections on the diversity of human cultures.                                                                                        NSF dollars are to cover the costs only of planning, building and               evaluating the exhibit, with no funds for staff.",
