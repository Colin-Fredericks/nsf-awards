 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nonlinear optical properties of quantum-confined structures and             superlattices in GaAs-GaAlAs semiconductors has been of significant             recent interest.  The PI's previous research have shown that by                 growing asymmetric quantum-well and superlattice structures, one can            achieve second-order nonlinear susceptibilities otherwise unobtainable          in conventional materials and comparable in magnitude to those of               organic nonlinear materials, without limitations usually found in               organic materials.  The practical implementation of the results can             find important applications in doubling the frequency of semiconductor          injection lasers, waveguide couplers, various sensors, optical logic            elements, novel ultra-fast and very sensitive photodetectors, and in            testing of electronic circuits.  The current research will investigate          more interesting heterostructures involving materials with various              band-offset combinations, as well as some of the novel opto-electronic          devices based on asymmetric quantum-well structures.  Theoretical work          will involve enhancement of the previous model in order to study a              wider range of materials and geometries and in order to better predict          the performance of the devices.  Experiments on nonlinear and time-             resolved spectroscopy of asymmetric quantum wells will be conducted in          a new laboratory currently being established.  The results of the               research could be an important step toward engineering of novel                 nonlinear materials and opto-electronic devices.",
