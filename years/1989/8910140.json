 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cowen will study the structure of certain bounded                linear operators on the Hardy space of the unit disk, looking at                concretely presented operators in order to gain insight into more               general problems. He will continue his investigations of                        composition operators and Toeplitz operators, the main issues                   being to identify commutants and decide sub- and hyponormality.                      The research envisioned here is about analytic functions, a                central preoccupation of mathematics for well over a century.                   They can be defined variously as solutions of a certain simple                  system of partial differential equations, as maps which take                    planar regions to other planar regions in a way that preserves                  angles except at isolated singularities, or as limits of                        polynomials in a suitably precise sense. Corresponding to the                   diverse ways of describing them, analytic functions can be                      studied in a variety of ways. The approach favored in this                      project is operator-theoretic, building up Hilbert spaces of                    functions by taking polynomials and their limits in a particular                fashion, then studying operators on the spaces that arise                       naturally from the functions, e.g. by multiplication or by                      composition. Conversely, these function-theoretic operators often               turn out to be quite general in operator theory, so by studying                 the functions one can learn a great deal about operators in the                 abstract.",
