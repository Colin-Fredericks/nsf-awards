 "awd_abstract_narration": "Philosophers of biology are among the most vocal critics of the                 view that scientific theories can be treated as sets of                         sentences.  Many of them have taken up a rival view, the semantic               view of theories, which holds that theories should be treated as                collections of abstract models.  Philosophers of biology have                   also challenged the idea that Mendelian genetics is being reduced               by molecular biology.  These anti-reductionist arguments are                    nearly always developed by treating theories as sets of                         sentences.  Dr. Waters, under this research grant, will develop                 what is long overdue: a new conception of theoretical reduction                 based on the semantic view of theories.  This new conception of                 reduction will be based on the idea that reducing entails                       providing deeper, but not necessarily simpler explanations.  Dr.                Waters will use this new conception to show how Mendelian                       genetics is being reduced by molecular theory.  Thus, this                      project entails presenting new accounts of the theories of                      Mendelian and molecular genetics explicitly in terms of the                     semantic view, developing a new conception of theoretical                       reduction, diffusing standing objections to reductionism about                  genetics, and applying these results to show how molecular                      biology is improving and deepening our understanding of Mendelian               genetics.",
