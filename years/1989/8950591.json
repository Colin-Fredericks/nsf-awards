 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry of the natural and man-made environment has long been a           focus of all levels of chemistry education at St. Andrews.  This                project extends the students' opportunity to learn and apply modern             analytical techniques to \"real-world\" systems.  High pressure liquid            chromatography and high sensitivity atomic absorption spectrometry are          used to help illustrate fundamental chemical principles ( redox,                solubility, and acid-base reactions; sampling and analysis) using               environmental chemical systems as a vehicle.  The important advances in         chemical techniques into the realms of very low pressures, air-                 sensitive substances, and high-energy systems has tended to take                attention away from the equally important chemistry of earth-surface            conditions.  The aim and significance of the project is to intrigue and         involve young chemistry students by including in their early training           insight into how the ideas of blackboard and laboratory chemistry play          themselves out in the complex world of ordinary experience.                                                                                                     The institution is providing funds equal to the amount of the award.",
