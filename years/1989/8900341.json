 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with unsteady aerodynamics and its                  relationship to helicopter or wind turbine rotors.  An important                unsolved problem is the stalling of the turbine rotor during periods            of high speed or gusty winds.  The immediate objective of this                  research is to eliminate the stalling of the rotor.  The response of            the rotor to a wind gust will be modelled using quasi-steady                    aerodynamics and the results compared with experimental data.  The              rotor's rotational speed (circulation around the blade) will be                 measured to determine if it lags behind the changing pitch of the               blade.  An adjustment will be made so that the speed of the rotor as a          function of wind gust speed will be made to increase slightly.  The             necessary increase will be predicted using the quasi-steady                     aerodynamics model.                                                                                                                                             A large single-blade wind turbine/helicopter rotor model will be                built with both rotor speed and blade pitch sensors.  Pressure                  transducers will be placed in the blade at strategic positions.  The            model will be tested in a suitable wind tunnel.  The speed of the               rotor and blade pitch will be monitored as the wind speed increases in          a gust-like, stepwise manner.",
