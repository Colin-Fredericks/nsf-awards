 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the issue of computer integrated                   manufacturing system control by investigating the basic needs                   associated with developing and implementing real-time scheduling                and control decision making tools for the environment.  The                     objective is to study the integration of real-time manufacturing                system status data with a computer simulation model of the system               to develop an effective and efficient tool to evaluate real-time                system scheduling and control decision alternatives.  The                       emphasis is upon creating a \"look-ahead\" capability to aid in                   assessing the long-term system performance impact resulting from                decisions made in real-time.  The investigation includes                        implementation issues that are essential for successfully making                the physical link between an actual operating system and a real-                time simulation to be used for intelligent real-time system                     control.  This research will also provide basic insight into the                system control problems in computer integrated manufacturing                    systems, and it will impact a key industrial concern for                        intelligent real-time control decisions.  This is an important                  link for achieving truly integrated systems.",
