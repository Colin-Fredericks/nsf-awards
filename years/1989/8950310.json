 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves scientists and teacher educators at Vanderbilt            University in a program to restructure the natural science component of         Vanderbilt's elementary teacher preparation program.  New science               courses for education and liberal arts students will be designed, and           the laboratory experience in these courses will be integrated with the          science methods course.  Fifteen \"consultant\" teachers from grades 4-6          in area schools will assist with the preparation of science units and           video materials, and the project will use videodisc technology to               integrate filmed classroom examples into the laboratories for the basic         science courses and into the science methods course.  These teachers            will also serve as cooperating teachers for practicum and student               teacher placements to ensure a coordinated experience from the basic            science courses to the classroom applications.  Curricula and video             matherials will be made available to other teacher preparation                  institutions throughout Tennessee through the Center of Excellence for          the Enrichment of Science and Mathematics Education.                                                                                                            The cost sharing will be thirty-eight percent of the National Science           Foundation award.",
