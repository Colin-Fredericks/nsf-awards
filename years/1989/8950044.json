 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microcomputers have become increasingly commonplace in college                  mathematics departments and it is generally agreed that they have a             significant role to play in enhancing the learning of mathematics.              However, what this role is and how to implement it are not clear.  The          two one-week regional workshops planned for the Summer of 1989 are              involving college mathematics faculty in learning to better utilize             electronic technology in undergraduate education.  The workshops are            also serving as a forum for the exchange of ideas and information on            this subject.  A Resource Manual is also being produced that is                 allowing for the dissemination and enabling the participants to carry           the results back to their home institutions where they will field test          the results during the Fall of 1989.  The host institution has a large          state-of-the-art mathematics laboratory in which many of the core               undergraduate courses  from Intermediate Algebra to Differential                Equations and Linear Algebra have been successfully integrated.  The            special facility and the amount of time and effort given to designing           novel ways to use it, make the institution a natural site for the               workshop.                                                                                                                                                       The participants will be contributing part of the costs of their                participation in the program.  In addition the host institution will            contribute funds to help support the travel of the participants.",
