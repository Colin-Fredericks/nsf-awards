Winer of Georgia Institute of Technology and Lu Shui-shong of                   National Taiwan University.  Tribology, an important field in                   mechanical engineering, is a study of interacting surfaces in                   relative motion including friction, lubrication, and wear.                                                                                                      The proposed symposium on tribology is the first such conference                in Taiwan with participation of US researchers.  The conference                 is expected to provide a significant opportunity for researchers                from both countries to discuss and exchange data on this area of                research and to further enhance collaborative activity on                       tribology.  This symposium is jointly supported by the NSF and                  the Taiwan National Science Council.",
