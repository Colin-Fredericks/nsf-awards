 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terrestrial studies of chemically mediated plant-herbivore                 interactions have contributed significantly to the discovery and                development of biotechnological applications for plant natural                  products. While our understanding of marine chemical ecology has                developed more slowly, recent collaborations between ecologist                  and chemists have been very productive and produced well designed               studies revealing the ecological and evolutionary importance of                 chemically mediated interactions between marine organisms. An                   increased understanding of the ecology and evolution of these                   chemically mediated interactions in marine communities should                   help build an ecologically-based framework for rationally                       approaching the biotechnological development of marine natural                  product.                                                                             This fellowship work by Dr. Lindquist will investigate the                 intraspecific variations in seaweed defenses, biotic and abiotic                factors producing thee variations and how variations in chemical                defenses interact with other defensive mechanisms.  Additionally,               since the chemical data base for ascidians is not nearly as                     extensive as that of marine algae and no published studies have                 experimentally addressed potential adaptive roles for ascidian                  secondary metabolites, further studies will make an evaluation of               ascidian metabolites as (1) feeding deterrents to generalist                    predators, (2) antifouling agents, (3) aids in spatial                          competition, (4) larval survival mechanisms and (5) a dynamic                   defense capable of being modified to minimize adverse affects                   from changing environmental stresses as the animals mature. These               potential roles are suggested for ascidian secondary metabolites                by preliminary experimental data and extensive ecological                       observations.",
