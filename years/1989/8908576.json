 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light affects daily (circadian) and seasonal cycles in physiology               and behavior.  Dr. Nunez will examine the neural and endocrine                  systems that mediate these effects of light on these biological                 rhythms.  The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is                    believed to be the neural substrate for the biological clock.                   Therefore, Dr. Nunez will concentrate on identifying the outputs                of the nucleus to determine how circadian signals reach the rest                of the central nervous system.  Both the circadian system and the               suprachiasmatic nucleus are involved in the generation of                       seasonal reproductive cycles but the projection or output from                  this neural structure involved in seasonal cycles appears to be                 different than the projections responsible for daily cycles.  It                appears that seasonal cycles may also involve the paraventricular               nucleus of the hypothalamus.  Dr. Nunez will also investigate the               pathways that originate in this brain structure.  In addition, he               will elucidate the endocrine changes that are produced by neural                damage that abolishes seasonal cyclicity.  Information about the                anatomy and physiology of this biological clock provides the                    basic science for a more comprehensive understanding of certain                 psychiatric disorders at the extreme and fluctuations in mood and               productivity in the more normal range.  An additional value of                  knowledge of controls of photoperiodism may lie in an increased                 efficiency in animal husbandry.",
