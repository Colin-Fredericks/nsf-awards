 "awd_abstract_narration": "For studies of the solar atmosphere, microwave observations                possess a unique sensitivity to magnetic fields which frequently                dominate the energetics of the active solar corona.  For studies                of the flaring atmosphere, the shape and parameterization of the                spatially resolved microwave spectrum provide a powerful                        diagnostic both of the ambient magnetic fields as well as of the                electron temperature, density and spectrum.                                          This program of solar microwave spectroscopy is funded in                  order to exploit this sensitivity for the study of solar flares                 and the magnetic structure of active regions during the peak of                 activity in the current solar cycle.                                                 The work will be based primarily on observations from the                  frequency-agile interferometer at the Owens Valley Radio                        Observatory, which provides high spatial resolution observations                at up to 86 frequencies from 1 to 18 GHz.  This unique instrument               is currently being upgraded so that its combination of imaging                  and spectroscopy to more complex sources.                                            The studies conducted under this grant will benefit from and               contribute to other facets of the MAX'91 program which include                  soft and hard x-ray and gamma ray imaging as well as other                      ground-based and balloon observations.//",
