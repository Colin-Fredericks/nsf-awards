 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do people hear and recognize the structure and meaning of                   spoken languages?  How do they recall the melodies and rhythms of               music?  How does the brain store such information and how is it                 retrieved from memory?  Are humans and animals alike in the way                 they make sense out of sounds they hear?  These are the general                 questions that lie behind Dr. Hulse's research.                                                                                                                 The underlying problem--how both humans and nonhuman animals                    learn and remember that sounds occur one after another--is                      fundamental for the survival of all species.  For example, just                 as humans must manage the serial sounds of language and music,                  animals (like birds and dolphins, for example) must recognize the               communication sounds of their own species in order to find and                  defend a place to live and to find a mate.                                                                                                                      As a sample of the research, birds will be tested for their                     ability to distinguish one pattern of pitches or rhythms from                   another.  Then the patterns will be changed systematically to                   tease apart the features the birds need to maintain their                       discrimination.  In this way, Dr. Hulse will try to discover the                critical features of serial sound patterns (such as bird song)                  that carry information crucial for communication.                                                                                                               Besides its focus on the basic problem of serial order in                       behavior, this research has the potential for some useful                       practical application.  In the long run, for example, we may gain               new information about the things that go wrong with language when               injury or stroke occurs.",
