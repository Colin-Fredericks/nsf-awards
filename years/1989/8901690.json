More                      specifically these problems concern the symmetry of                             solvmanifolds, geometric measure theoretic characterizations of                 Hadamard manifolds, constancy of eigenvalues, and Blaschke                      manifolds whose holonomy group is exceptional.                                       The surface of a two-holed inner tube is an example of a                   manifold which may have nonpositive curvature.  These have their                higher-dimensional analogues.  A foliation of one of these is a                 collection of lower-dimensional surfaces stacked together which                 fill up the manifold.  The holonomy group is a measure of the                   twisting and shearing of such leaves as they sweep through their                ambient manifolds.  The principal investigator will study deep                  questions concerning holonomy on specialized sorts of manifolds.",
