 "awd_abstract_narration": "The number of stable inexpensive anode materials available                 for the electrosynthesis of chemicals is quite limited.  Phase                  I research demonstrated that a series of novel, inexpensive                     electrodes could be used as new anode materials for a number of                 industrially important electrochemical processes.  In                           particular, the electrode materials have provided equal or                      superior performance to platinum for the electrosynthesis of                    persulfate and dimethyl sebacate.                                                    Research in Phase II will continue these studies, focusing                 on achieving a more fundamental understanding of the electrode                  processes for each reaction.  The important chemical and                        electrochemical variables, including supporting electrolyte,                    substrate and product concentration, current density,                           temperature, and additives, will be explored in more detail to                  understand their respective roles on current efficiency and                     electrode stability.  Electrode pretreatment, electrode                         bonding, and new electrode designs will also be examined.                       Studies will the performed in electrochemical flow cells,                       providing performance data that is expected to lead to Phase                    III funding for one or both of these processes.",
