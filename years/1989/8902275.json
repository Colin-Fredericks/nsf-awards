 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Rovnyak will pursue developments consequent upon                 the proof of the Bieberbach conjecture in complex analysis. The                 latter has led to a study of contractive substitution trans-                    formations in certain Krein spaces that include and generalize                  the Dirichlet space. Properties of these transformations will be                explored both from the point of view of invariant subspace theory               and the theory of linear operators on spaces with indefinite                    metric. A long-range goal is a coefficient body problem that                    seeks to characterize initial segments of power series which                    represent normalized Riemann mapping functions that map the disk                into itself. Related abstract extension problems and commutant                  lifting theorems for contraction operators on Krein spaces will                 also be studied.                                                                     The research envisioned here is about analytic functions, a                central preoccupation of mathematics for well over a century.                   They can be defined variously as solutions of a certain simple                  system of partial differential equations, as maps which take                    planar regions to other planar regions in a way that preserves                  angles except at isolated singularities, or as limits of                        polynomials in a suitably precise sense. Corresponding to the                   diverse ways of describing them, analytic functions can be                      studied in a variety of ways. The approach favored in this                      project is operator-theoretic, building up Hilbert spaces of                    functions by taking polynomials and their limits in a particular                fashion, then studying operators on the spaces that arise                       naturally from the functions, e.g. by multiplication or by                      composition. Conversely, these function-theoretic operators often               turn out to be quite general in operator theory, so by studying                 the functions one can learn a great deal about operators in the                 abstract.",
