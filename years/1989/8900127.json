 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cantwell will investigate the structure of                       codimension one foliations.  The existence of foliations of knot                complements, leafwise hyperbolic structures, smoothability of                   foliations, and ergodic properties will be studied. This work                   expands the Principal Investigator's theory of levels which has                 made a profound impact on development of foliation theory and has               led to interaction with the French and Japanese schools of                      foliations.                                                                          The mathematical theory of foliations concerns the filling                 of space by stacks of surfaces or \"leaves\".  Cantwell helped to                 prove that any surface may be a leaf of a foliation.  Since some                surfaces wrap upon themselves, this proof was very difficult.                   Now Cantwell will further his theory by understanding foliations                which fill all of a space except for a knot.  The understanding                 of knots has recently become very important to the understanding                of thermodynamics and molecular biology.",
