 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Puget Sound proposes a two year project combining             content and leadership training for 64 elementary teachers of grades 3-6        in the Tacoma Public Schools.  A team of two persons/school, a teacher          and the principal will participate in this program which consists of an         intensive four-week summer science content and \"hands-on\" science               teaching for the teachers followed by a one-week leadership program for         teachers and their principals.                                                                                                                                  The four week program each summer will include several teaching sessions        in which the teachers will teach this \"hands-on\" science to Science Camp        students.  These Grade 3-6 students will be given the opportunity to            attend this Camp, which will be held at UPS, at no charge.  This                provides a unique environment for the teachers to put the theory into           practice, i.e. they will test out their enhanced abilities in content           and teaching strategies under the guidance of the project staff.                                                                                                The principal/teacher teams will participate in special leadership              workshops to ensure the implementation of the improved science                  instruction at their schools.  During the school year, eight half-day           \"networking-follow up\" meetings will be held for the purpose of                 exchanging information on their science teaching activities.  In                October, each team will present their plans for                                 improving science teaching/learning in their building.  In May,                 they will report on the results of their efforts.  Project staff                will be involved in these meetings as well as in observing each                 participating teacher at least twice during the school year.                                                                                                    An amount equivalent to 37% of the NSF request has been cost-                   shared by the University of Puget Sound and the participating                   schools.",
