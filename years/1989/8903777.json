 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal goals of this project are to develop and                          evaluate new, high resolution NMR methodologies for use in                      studies of the structure and dynamics of biomacromolecules                      and to improve the performance of some of the most popular,                     existing techniques.  The research will focus on experiments                    designed to facilitate the assignment of complex NMR spectra,                   to obtain distance constraints for use in structural                            determinations and to simplify the task of identifying                          critical information in the NMR spectra of molecular                            assemblies.  NMR spectroscopy is an extremely powerful tool                     in such applications and it is very important to continue to                    improve the methodology to meet the increasing challenges                       presented in biochemistry and molecular biology.                                                                                                                NMR spectroscopy is an invaluable tool for studying the                         structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules and for                     probing the interactions involved in molecular assemblies.                      For example, two- dimensional, high resolution NMR                              spectroscopy has become the method of choice for determining                    the structure of small proteins and nucleic acid fragments in                   solution.  With the development of increasingly sophisticated                   methodologies, including the use of isotopic labelling, and                     with significant improvements in instrumentation, it is now                     becoming feasible to obtain detailed information about                          molecular interactions in systems such as drug-DNA,                             enzyme-substrate and antibody-antigen complexes.*** //",
