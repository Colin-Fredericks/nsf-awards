 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator award from the Inorganic,                  Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program will support                  the research of Dr. Mercouri Kanatzidis on the chemistry of                     sulfur and selenium compounds of heavy metals. One facet of the                 research program will focus on the chemistry of ruthenium/                      sulfur compounds, with the aim of attaining new insights into                   heterogeneous catalytic processes such as the                                   hydrodesulfurization of petroleum by ruthenium disulfide. The                   second facet of the research program involves research at the                   interface of inorganic chemistry and materials science. The                     techniques of synthetic inorganic chemistry will be used to                     produce precursors to new materials, such as low dimensional                    intermetallic alloys. Anionic soluble clusters containing late                  transition and main group metals bridged by either selenium or                  tellurium will be formed in solution and then precipitated with                 heavy metals such as cadmium to form new solid compounds. An                    example of a substance synthesized in this manner has the                       composition Cd:Hg:Te = 1:1:8, and has potential applications in                 the area of low energy detection. Also to be explored are                       syntheses of metal/sulfur and metal/selenium compounds at high                  temperatures with molten salts as solvents. Of particular                       interest are compounds containing S-S or Se-Se bonds which can                  be reductively (and reversibly) cleaved electrochemically or by                 reaction with alkali metals. Such materials may be useful as                    cathodes for high energy density rechargeable batteries.",
