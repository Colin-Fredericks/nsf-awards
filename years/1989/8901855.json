Hubbard of Utah State University in this project in the                 Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program.                   These compounds are valuable new members of the family of                       alpha-substituted alkyl derivatives of transition metals which                  are known to be important intermediates in processes such as                    carbon monoxide reduction, hydroformylation and other catalytic                 syntheses.                                                                                                                                                      The compounds to be employed in the study include                               cyclopentadienyl (or pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) nitrosyl                      metal alpha-haloalkyls of chromium, molybdenum and tungsten as                  well as cyclopentadienyl nitrosyl haloalkyl metal halides of                    iron and ruthenium and the di(haloalkyl)derivatives of the                      latter metals. The compounds have been made readily accessable                  by recent impvovements in their synthesis via the reaction of                   diazoalkanes with precursor metal halides. Some reaction types                  to be studied are photolytic and thermal decompositions or                      rearrangements and simple air oxidations.",
