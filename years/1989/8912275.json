 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California at Santa Barbara maintains a                  field station in the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains for research               and teaching in the field sciences.  The Sierra Nevada Aquatic                  Research Laboratory (SNARL) serves as a base for many scientists                working in east-central California and western Nevada.  In                      addition, SNARL protects a variety of terrestrial and freshwater                habitats for teaching and research use.                                                                                                                              This project will provide funds to construct fifteen medium-               sized experimental stream channels to augment the existing stream               and pond system at SNARL.  The new channels will fill an                        important gap in the scale of experimental units available at                   SNARL, which currently has only small laboratory and field                      channels and a series of large field channels which were formed                 by division of an existing natural stream.  The new, medium-sized               field channels will allow investigators to examine the effects of               spatial scale on the outcomes of experimental manipulations.  The               channels will simulate the physical, chemical and biological                    characteristics of natural streams while providing sufficient                   replication for rigorous experimental designs.                                                                                                                       Although the existing stream channels at SNARL do not                      provide sufficient replication for most experiments, they are                   still a realistic and important component of the battery of                     experimental units at the site.  Therefore, the project also                    provides funds to repair the concrete control structures on the                 existing experimental stream system.",
