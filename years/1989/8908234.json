 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will complete the study of                      Kahler-Einstein metrics on compact Kahler manifolds.  Compact                   algebraic manifolds with zero first Chern class will be                         classified.  Stable vector bundles will be constructed over these               manifolds.  Complete Kahler-Einstein metrics whose scalar                       curvature is either negative or zero will be constructed.  The                  investigators will work toward understanding non-compact complete               Kahler-Einstein manifolds with zero Ricci curvature.  These are                 being studied extensively by particle physicists who are                        interested in superstring theory.                                                    In a related investigation, non-collision singularities of                 the n-body problem from celestial mechanics will be studied.                    Super-hyperbolic and oscillatory solutions which arise from the                 final evolution of a gravitational system will be the focus of a                special investigation.                                                               Two projects will focus on mathematics relevant to particle                physics and cosmology.  Einstein's dream of formulating a general               field theory which encompasses all four basic forces of nature,                 from strong nuclear to gravitational, will come closer to                       realization upon completion of this project. Solutions to                       Newton's equations of planetary motion which predict orbits which               go to infinity in finite time will be further investigated.",
