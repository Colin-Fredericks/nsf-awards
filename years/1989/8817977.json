 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary biologists are concerned with understanding the               diversity of mating systems found in the animal kingdom and the                 factors that affect those systems.  One important factor that                   influences the mating system is the amount of parental care that                males give.  This in turn is influenced by a male's confidence of               paternity; that is, a male should not willingly care for                        offspring if there is a reasonable probability that they were                   fathered by a different male.  Thus, paternity confidence is an                 important question in species that are monogamous and have high                 levels of male parental care.  Although this question has                       interested scientists for some time, technological advances (DNA                fingerprinting) have only recently made exploration of the                      question feasible.  This research explored this question for the                zebra finch, a bird native to Australia that has long-term, often               life-long, pair bonds and substantial male care.  The species is                ideal for study because it is possible to combine experimental                  (non-invasive) laboratory studies (in Illinois) with                            investigation of free-living birds (in Australia).  This project                will increase our understanding of animal social organization.                  Findings of this study will be integrated with those of other                   species, resulting in generalizations that should increase our                  understanding of the process of social evolution in humans --                   which also have high male parental care -- as well as other                     species.",
