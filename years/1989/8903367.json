 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop addresses high-performance input/output architectures,            which is a critical computer-system architectural challenge of the next         decade.  The focus is on identifying the input/output bottlenecks and           potential methods for overcoming them.  The workshop places a special           emphasis on disk array organizations as the vehicle through which high          performance is achieved.  The workshop brings together, for the first           time, experts from across the whole spectrum of technologies needed for         high-performance input/output.  This include representatives from disk          device, array, and controller vendors, as well as mainframe and                 supercomputer architects, and producers of high speed networks and              operating systems.                                                              Improvement in input/output is essential as the computational speed of          computers grows.  Due to a lack of breakthrough in input/output                 technologies, parallelism in input/output is the logical solution to            the problem.  This workshop addresses this challenge in matching the            input/output rate through parallel processing and the computational             speeds of high-performance workstations and supercoputers that will             appear in the 1990's.  Support is highly recommended.",
