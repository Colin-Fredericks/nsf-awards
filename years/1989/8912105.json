 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1955 The Southwestern Research Station, a research                        facility of The American Museum of Natural History, has been                    promoting and facilitating investigations by natural scientists                 who work in the American Southwest.  Each year well over a                      hundred scientists, from around the country and overseas, come to               the Station to study volcanic rock structures, birds, reptiles,                 amphibians, spiders, insects, plants and mammals.  These                        scientists are attracted to the Station by the scientific                       facilities, the researcher community, and the richness of the                   unique biota of the Chiricahua Mountains and surrounding desert                 areas.                                                                                                                                                          The Station, located on a 90 acre site at 5400 feet elevation, is               the uppermost private land in Cave Creek Canyon (one of the most                outstanding birding localities in North America) on the east side               of the Chiricahua Mountains.  It is surrounded by U.S. Forest                   Service property (Coronado National Forest).  The scientific                    significance of the site for field researchers results from the                 ecological diversity of habitats and the taxonomic diversity of                 organisms that may be found within a few miles of the facility.                                                                                                 This project will improve the technical facilities of the                       Research Station in order to meet the needs of modern field                     scientists.  With increasing frequency, scientist are relying on                sophisticated technological developments to probe nature.  The                  existing buildings and equipment are suitable for many types of                 traditional research collecting.  But physiological ecology,                    biochemical taxonomy, and photomicroscopy are important modern                  tools for field scientists.                                                                                                                                     Currently the Station lacks a laboratory where ambient                          temperature can be controlled.  The project will rectify that                   situation through the construction of a small modern building,                  and by equipping it with microscopes, balances and temperature                  controlled chambers.",
