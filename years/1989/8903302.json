 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project covers research on a variety of topics in low                 dimensional manifolds, Donaldson and Casson invariants, theory of               transformation groups on algebraic surfaces, and cohomology of                  finite and discrete groups.  Jointly D. Wilczynski and R. Lee                   plan to investigate the problem of representing homology classes                of simply connected 4-manifolds by 2-spheres, in both the                       topological and the smooth category.  With S. Weintraub, R. Lee                 plans to continue their work on Siegel modular varieties of genus               2.  Using Casson's invariant and Floer homology, R. Lee, S.                     Cappell and E. Miller plan to study the theory of surgery on 3-                 dimensional manifolds.  With I. Hambleton and F. Raymond, R. Lee                plans to investigate algebraic group actions on algebraic                       surfaces with special emphasis on the applications to 4-                        dimensional manifold theory.  Finally with J. Milgram, J.                       Maginnis and J. Martino, he plans to study the cohomology of                    sporadic groups.                                                                     These are all topics in the mainstream of current                          topological research.  The hallmark of R. Lee's approach is to                  choose very concrete problems and bring to bear techniques from                 an impressively large and high-powered arsenal.  Some problems                  yield to algebraic geometry, some to complex analysis, some to                  group theory , and so forth.  The result is another clear                       demonstration of the unity of mathematics.",
