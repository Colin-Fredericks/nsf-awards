 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bates will purchase automated sedimentology lab equipment:  a                   Micromeritics Sedigraph 5100 and IBM-compatible personal computer and           software.  This equipment will be used in the analysis of fine-grained          sediment samples recovered in coordinated field/lab exercises in                introductory geology, sedimentology, glacial and Quaternary geology             courses, and in independent student research.  This equipment allows            rapid and detailed particle size analysis, data reduction and graphic           presentation of analytical results with a minimum of time expenditure           and sample preparation.                                                                                                                                         Grain size distribution of sediments is often a function of the basic           energy imparted to materials by wind, water, or glaciers.  Hence, the           analysis of grain size of sediment is a critical descriptive tool used          by sedimentary geologists to help to fingerprint depositional processes         or environments of deposition.  Students in geology curriculum at Bates         Collge are introduced to these processes and environments through field         work in introductory and more advanced courses, intensive short term            courses and senior thesis research.  Automated sediment analysis will           enhance the existing curriculum and facilities in the geology                   department.  In addition, the new facility will introduce students to           modern sedimentological techniques and allow them to conduct more               detailed and accurate analyses of geologic materials.  The college is           matching the grant with an equal amount of funds.",
