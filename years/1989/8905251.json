 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research on Automorphic Forms of                   Professor Dinakar Ramakrishnan of the California Institute of                   Technology. Dr. Ramakrishnan plans to continue his work on cusp                 forms of arithmetic type on GL(2), and to investigate certain                   ensuing problems concerning the Shimura varieties attached to                   GSp(4) and U(4). He also plans to study the cohomology and cycle                classes on these varieties with a view to finding examples of the               expected relationship to poles and zeros of L-functions.                             Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of Modular and Automorphic Forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of Geometry and Analysis, it                      retains connection to its historical roots.",
