 "awd_abstract_narration": "A gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) has been acquired and             used to perform undergraduate research and teach undergraduate                  students.  The instrument is quite versatile in terms of capillary GC           separation, and mass spectral identification by both electron-impact as         well as chemical ionization.  It is easily operable so that students            can obtain hands-on experience.  The instrument is used to teach a              variety of upper level undergraduate courses, such as Instrumental              Analysis, Qualitative Organic Analysis, and Physical Chemistry, as well         as being used in several undergraduate projects.  The students obtain a         thorough knowledge of fundamental and analytical aspects of GC-MS as            well as exposure to modern chemical instrumentation.  The institution           is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
