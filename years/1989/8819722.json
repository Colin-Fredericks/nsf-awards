 "awd_abstract_narration": "The distinction that once separated the nervous and endocrine                   system is becoming increasingly blurred.  Attention is now being                focused on hormones as neuromodulators.  Since neurons                          communicate by means of neurotransmitters released at the                       synaptic terminals, it is important to examine how hormones                     interact with or modulate this process.  Dr. Raible is examining                this relationship.  She has found that a neuropeptide, alpha-                   melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), produces both a short term                (same day) and long term (one week later) inhibition of steroid-                induced reproductive behavior.  Interestingly, MSH, which is                    released during cervical stimulation, is thought to be involved                 in the induction of pseudopregnancy.  Dr. Raible will                           systematically examine the role of ovarian steroid hormones                     (estrogen, progesterone) and the neurotransmitter, serotonin, in                mediating the inhibitory effects of MSH.  These results will                    increase our knowledge of hormone-neurotransmitter-peptide                      interactions in modulating reproductive states.  Elucidating the                physiological mechanisms underlying the inhibition of                           reproductive behavior will lead to a better understanding of                    infertility and, thus, contribute to the development of                         successful methods of treatment.",
