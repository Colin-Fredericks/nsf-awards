 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this conference is to provide a forum for an                exchange of ideas between researchers in the Manufacturing Systems              Program, Manufacturing Machines and Systems Program, and the                    Automation and Systems Integration Program mainly, to assure that               these individual researchers are informed about the present ongoing             activities of their colleagues.  Thus an elimination of duplication             of their efforts may be achieved and a degree of cooperation may                result.  An overall improvement of efficiency of the programs would             be expected.  In addition, the conference program organization                  allows for ample time to discuss manufacturing research in detail               with the collective research community at the meeting with feedback             and input from the National Science Foundation.  Finally, personal              contacts with researchers in the programs should contribute to                  clarifying many current problems in their work.  Principal                      Investigator's will have one to two years advanced information as it            often takes that much time between the report of the work presented             at the grantees conference and the publication of papers about this             work in the literature.",
