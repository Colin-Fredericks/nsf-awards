 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. James Zeidler and Deborah Pearsall will collaborate for two                seasons of fieldwork at the site of San Isidro which is located                 in the Jama drainage in northern Ecuador.  They will continue to                excavate at the site and also extend their survey of the                        surrounding region.  San Isidro contains a large, centrally                     located earthen mound which suggests that it functioned as a                    regional ceremonial and administrative center.  The site's size                 and monumental architecture imply the existence of surplus                      production capable of supporting a dense population, and                        materials recovered to date suggest that San Isidro was a major                 point of external contact and commodity flow both along the coast               of Ecuador and between the coast and the highlands.  The research               team will excavate large blocks within the site to reconstruct                  settlement history and determine how it changed over time.                      Continued survey and test excavation at other sites will allow                  extension of this pattern to a regional level.  Particular                      emphasis will be placed on subsistence technology and an attempt                will be made to reconstruct the agricultural system.                                                                                                            The goal of the research is to study the process of demographic                 growth as well as change in subsistence and the accompanying                    development of cultural complexity which took place in this                     tropical area of northern Ecuador.  Although such complex                       societies arose in the tropics, many times, in different parts of               the world, the underlying processes are not well understood.                    This research will allow the testing of different models.  While                Ecuador is known to be rich in prehistoric remains, little                      archaeological research has been conducted there.  This project                 will help to remedy that situation.",
