 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective is to develop a framework for an                    expert system to assist designers during the early design stages                and within the environment of a Computer-Aided Design system in                 the design of easy to assemble products.  The system will provide               estimates of the difficulty level in the automatic assembly of                  mechanical designs, provide re-design recommendations, and                      identify changes required in other components due to these                      suggestions.                                                                         The research consists of: (1) the development and                          implementation of a basic flexible assembly model (BAM) and a                   second mode assembly model (SMAM) for mechanical products, (2)                  the development of a set of rules and procedures that employ the                information in the models to design easy to assemble mechanical                 products, (3) the development of control strategies to process                  these rules and procedures and (4) the implementation of the                    rules and control strategies in an IBM AT compatible computer                   using AutoCAD and AutoLISP.                                                          The system will allow more flexibility in the assembly                     definition, automatically implementing changes in the complete                  assembly after performing re-design changes in specific product                 features.  This will yield better products for automatic assembly               operations.  Future expansion of the system will allow the                      implementation of a complete decision support system which                      integrates design, process planning, and actual assembly.",
