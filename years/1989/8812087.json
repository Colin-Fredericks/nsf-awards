 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue the analysis of secular climate                 and atmospheric circulation fluctuations occurring around the                   Atlantic Ocean.  The study will analyze Atlantic sea surface                    temperature (SST) and associated atmospheric circulation                        variability as well as recent climatic fluctuations occurring                   since the mid-1940s.  The role of the Southern Oscillation (SO)                 in the development and evolution of Atlantic SST anomalies will                 be evaluated.  The interaction between the North Atlantic                       Oscillation (NAO) and SO in the Atlantic will be examined as will               their association with SST anomalies in non-winter seasons.                     Since the mid-1940s, the wintertime Atlantic westerlies have                    fluctuated in strength, being unusually strong until the late                   1950s, the 1960s and late 1970s.  The study will further document               these circulation and associated climatic fluctuation in the land               station and marine air temperature fields, and it will evaluate                 the evidence for climatic fluctuations occurring in spring,                     summer and autumn.  The association between SSTs and the climatic               fluctuations will be examined, to explore ocean linkages to the                 abrupt fluctuations and subsequent persistent circulation and                   climate regimes.                                                                     This work may improve our capability for seasonal climate                  prediction and may benefit marine fishery industry in the North                 Atlantic.",
