 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comprehensive yet cohesive Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE)                   Laboratory will be established.  Recently there have been significant           advances in NDE methods and equipment that have led to greater                  utilization by manufacturing engineers for the assurance of product             safety, quality and reliability of their products.  The need for NDE            will continue to increase as new materials are manufactured in more             complex ways, service lifes are expanded and production facilities              become more fully automated.  The educational objective leading to the          establishment of this laboratory is to expose undergraduate                     engineering students who i) enroll in a NDE course, ii) do a senior             project using a proposed NDE system, or iii) participate in a course            using one or more NDE systems for experiments, to a comprehensive set           of contemporary NDE systems, review the scientific principles on which          each system is based and to have them become proficient with state-of-          the-art, user-friendly NDE instrumentation.  Equipment in the areas of          thermography, ultrasonics, eddy current, magnetoelastic (Barkhausen)            effect, acoustic emission, speckle pattern interferometry, laser                doppler velocimeter-vibrometry and laser optical scanning microscopy            are required.  Students will be attracted from various engineering              departments, thus fostering the cooperation and interaction so                  necessary to an integrated, systems approach to manufacturing.",
