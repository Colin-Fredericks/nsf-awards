 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a great potential for the use of trace elements in the                 study of oceanic processes.  However, this potential has not                    been realized to the extent that it could be due to the time,                   cost, and technique involved in most types of trace element                     analysis.   Thus, it would be desirable to have available                       analytical  techniques which:  a)  reduce analysis times, b)                    can be used on shipboard and possibly in-situ, c) are                           inexpensive, and hence d)  are accessible to a wide variety of                  analysts.  This is a proposal to develop new trace element                      analysis systems which will meet these criteria.  Such systems                  are possible using kinetic-  catalytic colorimetric reactions                   adapted for continuous flow analysis.  The best available                       kinetic-catalytic reaction schemes  will be adapted for                         determining the elements manganese, copper, and iron.                           Shipboard tests will be performed using the new systems and                     results compared with analyses performed by other accepted                      techniques.  The suitability of the new analysis systems will                   also be evaluated for making in-situ measurements and                           preliminary attempts will be made to develop an in-situ                         analysis system.",
