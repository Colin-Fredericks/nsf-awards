 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by Paul Young of the University of Illinois,                       Chicago, is within the Organic Dynamics Program, and is aimed                   at a study of the reactions of organic compounds containing                     tricoordinate (i.e., three bonds) sulfur atoms.  The detailed                   pathway by which these compounds react with negatively charged                  species will be investigated with special attention given to                    the competition between single and multiple step routes.  This                  work should allow chemists to better predict and control                        complex reactions involving sulfur atoms.                                                                                                                       There is a significant body of data suggesting that, under                      certain conditions, alkyl transfer reactions from simple                        sulfonium salts may occur through a ligand coupling mechanism                   involving reductive elimination from an intermediate                            tetracoordinate sulfurane.  This suggestion is easily testable                  by monitoring the product distribution and stereochemistry of                   selected reactions.  A series of chiral S-methyl-S-(substituted                 alpha-methylbenzyl)-S-(substituted phenyl)sulfonium salts with                  known chirality around the benzyl group will be synthesized,                    and reacted with the following nucleophiles:  (1) substituted                   ethyl alcohols (solvolysis conditions will be utilized and the                  progress of the reaction followed by NMR), (2) substituted                      pyridines and primary, secondary and tertiary amines in aprotic                 solvents and protic solvents found to support minimal                           solvolysis activity, (3) strong nucleophiles including                          phosphines and carbanions, (4) high concentrations of                           substituted acetates and benzoates under conditions where a                     second-order dependence on nucleophile concentration is                         observed, and (5) bifunctional nucleophiles including alpha-                    pyridones and alpha-pyridinethiones.  For each class of                         nucleophile, product distributions will be obtained with                        special emphasis on the chirality of the transferred benzyl                     group.  For each of the observed pathways, the effects of                       structure on reactivity will be investigated using classical                    Hammett and Bronsted correlations.  Secondary deuterium isotope                 effects and C-13 isotope effects on the nucleophilic rate                       constants will be determined for comparison with isotope                        effects observed for methyl transfers catalyzed by the enzyme,                  catechol-O-methyltransferase.  The effect of nucleophile                        strength on the partitioning pathways will be investigated,                     both within a given series (Bronsted correlations) and across                   the array of nucleophiles investigated (N+-type correlations).                  These data, taken as a complete set, will define the limits of                  the \"ligand coupling\" pathway in substitution reactions                         occurring at tricoordinate sulfur and will allow a more                         complete understanding of the role of nucleophile structure on                  each of the potential pathways for the alkyl transfer process.",
