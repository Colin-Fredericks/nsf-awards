 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI) project is in                  the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                 subfield of separations science. The focus of this research is                  on the development of new chemically bonded stationary phases                   for chromatography. In general, the research involves new                       synthetic approaches to bonding organic moieties to silica as                   well as modification of alumina surfaces. Four major synthetic                  steps are proposed involving 1) chlorination/Grignard                           chemistry, 2) silica hydride intermediates, 3) bonded olefin                    modification and 4) bonded liquid crystal stationary phases.                    The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to provide a                      better understanding of bonded phase interactions and to better                 understand the role of the support surface in chromatographic                   separations.                                                                                                                                                    This research is designed to better understand how molecules                    are separated using chromatography. New types of schemes are                    proposed for preparing novel columns for separating chemicals.                  The ultimate goal of this research is to provide a better                       theory for these separations which will in turn allow                           prediction of better separation schemes.",
