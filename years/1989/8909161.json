 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves analytical and experimental investigations                of piezoelectric ceramics of chosen three-dimensional geometries                leading to synthesis of three-dimensional piezoceramic                          microactuators. Preliminary analytical models based on finite                   element methods will be developed to predict the behavior of                    three-dimensional piezoceramic materials of arbitrary geometries                under a variety of static loading conditions.                                                                                                                      The goals of the research are:                                                                                                                               .  To enhance the scope of the finite element based analytical                     modeling to reliably predict the behavior of three-dimensional                  piezoceramic geometries.                                                                                                                                     .  To conduct experimental studies on three-dimensional                            piezoceramic geometries to investigate the level of                             performance of the analytical models, and                                                                                                                    .  To initiate conceptual designs of three-dimensional                             piezoceramic microactuators.                                                                                                                                    The long term goal is to design a practical three-dimensional                   piezoceramic micropositioning device capable of executing                       highly precise translations and rotations, while capable of                     exerting large surface forces simultaneously.  Such a device                    would be expected to significantly advance the state of the                     art in industrial automation involving micro-assembly as well                   as in surgical applications in medicine.                                        ***",
