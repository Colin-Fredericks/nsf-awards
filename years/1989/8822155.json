 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute of Marine Science at the University of Alaska                     will further develop flow cytometric techniques for marine                      biology and oceanography.  The Institute has been                               instrumental in adapting flow cytometry, a technology                           developed for use in the biomedical research community, for                     ocean science research.  With this technique, a stream of                       bacteria, cells, or other microscopic particles is passed                       through a laser light beam.  Different cells and particles                      can be enumerated and classified according to how they                          fluoresce or react in response to the laser light.  Analysis                    of the fluoresced signal can yield important information on                     cell size, cellular constituents, and metabolic condition.                      This effort will continue to focus on using flow cytometry                      for studying marine bacteria.                                                                                                                                   Work will continue on developing appropriate flow cytometry                     standards and protocols.  The laboratory will also be                           available for use by guest investigators.  Coordination with                    industry will promote further development and modifications                     to basic flow cytometry instrumentation for oceanographic                       research.  Improvements and modifications will be directed                      towards expanding dynamic range of the instrument and                           increasing sensitivity.  Methods for determining protein                        content per cell and membrane potential will also be                            explored.",
