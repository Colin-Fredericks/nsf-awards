 "awd_abstract_narration": "Females of a species generally produce relatively few, large               gametes (eggs), while males produce many small gametes (sperm).                 A general principle in behavioral ecology is that this disparity                differences observed between females and males.  To understand                  this principle one must consider the causes of variation in                     reproductive success for each sex.  Successful females, those                   which best pass their genes to the next generation, are those                   that most efficiently convert resources into eggs and that have a               genetic predisposition to mate with a genetically superior male.                A female tends not to benefit from mating with several males,                   since a single mating can fertilize all of her eggs.  By                        contrast, a male can greatly enhance his reproductive success                   through several matings.                                                             One of the few exceptions to this rule may be Drosophila                   pachea, a fruit fly endemic to the Sonoran desert that lives only               within rotting tissue of senita cactus.  Reproductive success of                D. pachea males may be limited by the number of sperm they                      produce.  Sperm are huge, 12.5 mm long, and very helical,                       resembling the spring of a ballpoint pen.  Males exhaust their                  supply of stored sperm after a few copopulations.  Additionally,                females tend to not receive an adequate supply of sperm to                      fertilize all of their eggs.  Consequently females will remate                  several times daily.  The investigators' research goal is to                    pattern of sperm production by D. pachea males and to describe                  male and female mate choice and mating strategy.                                     Studies of the reproductive biology of Drosophila pachea                   should greatly contribute to the understanding of the evolution                 of life history traits.  Further, because several close relatives               of D. pachea are agricultural pests, understanding the mating                   system of this fly may benefit biological control programs.",
