 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of mass transport through ion                     exchange polymer films.  Different microstructures of ion                       exchange polymers, which exhibit local short range order (5 to                  100 nanometers), will be induced through thermal processing as                  well as by sorption in microstructured substrates such as                       polycarbonate membranes and latex spheres.  The microstructure                  of the polymer layer will be evaluated by infrared and X-ray                    spectroscopies and its transport-selectivity determined by                      electrochemical methods.  Mathematical models will be developed                 for the relationships between these properties.                                                                                                                 Mass transport through ion exchange membranes and its                           enhancement through electrostatic effects is an important field                 both scientifically and technologically, with implications for                  biological systems.  Development of generalized relationships                   describing their transport characteristics will facilitate                      optimization of separators for specific applications, design of                 catalysts with active sites situated in microstructured                         matrices that control the transport of selected species, and                    fabrication of modified electrodes for electrochemical                          catalysis and analysis.",
