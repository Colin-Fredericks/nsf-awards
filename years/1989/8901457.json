 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bounding surfaces (disconformities) of regional extent (super                   bounding surfaces) have recently been recognized and described                  from a number of eolian sandstone units in the western United                   States.  These surfaces are a potentially important tool for sub-               dividing and correlating eolian sequences, leading ultimately to                a better understanding of how such sedimentary bodies evolve.                   However, features diagnostic of super bounding surfaces formed by               climatic, tectonic, eustatic or endogenic causes have yet to be                 fully recognized and documented.  The best way to document such                 features and to understand how they form is to study their                      occurrence in a modern sand sea that is known to have experienced               episodic eolian deposition.  The Gran Desierto sand sea in                      northern Mexico is an excellent example of a sand sea that been                 strongly affected by changes in the regional tectonic, eustatic                 and climatic environment.  These changes have resulted in an                    episodic deposition of eolian sand, separated by long periods of                stability and non deposition or erosion.  This study will                       undertake filed investigations of relations between sand bodies                 of different ages and regional-scale bounding surfaces formed by                dune and sand sea migration, sea level change, and interruption                 of sand supply due to climatic and other factors.  Criteria for                 the recognition of super bounding surfaces of different origins                 and more precise models for the formation of super bounding                     surfaces will be developed on the basis of these investigations.",
