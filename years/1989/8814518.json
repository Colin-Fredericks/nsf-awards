 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polar regions play an important role in the globally                       linked climate system.  Observations of antarctic                               stratospheric ozone depletion provide ample evidence of the                     uniqueness of polar atmospheric chemistry owing to extreme cold                 and prolonged darkness.  During the winter and spring months,                   the arctic troposphere contains elevated concentrations of                      aerosols and gases which are transported from lower latitudes.                  Little is known about the chemical processing and removal of                    the gas phase constituents.  The nitrogen oxides are a primary                  factor in controlling the tropospheric level of ozone.                          Tropospheric ozone, in turn, is believed to be increasing in                    the northern hemisphere.  Consequently, understanding the                       chemistry of the reactive nitrogen species is important.                             This project will measure the abundance of several gaseous                 nitrogen species including nitric oxide, nitric acid, total                     reactive odd nitrogen, and peroxyacetyl nitrate. These                          measurements will be complemented with determination of nitrate                 concentrations in aerosols, rain, snow, and snowpack.  Three                    primary questions will be addressed: (1) What are the                           concentrations of various nitrogen oxide species with respect                   to meteorological and temporal variations in central Alaska?                    (2) What is the chemical processing of these species and how is                 it related to ozone concentrations? and (3) How important is                    wet and dry deposition as a removal mechanism for these species                 in central Alaska?",
