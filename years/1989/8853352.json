 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to introduce integrated manufacturing                into the upper level undergraduate curriculum through development               of a laboratory.  Generally, the technical area deals primarily                 with computer usage in the integrated manufacturing environment:                computer simulation, human-computer interaction, and knowledge-                 based computer-aided engineering.  Suitable computer work                       stations are essential.  These stations must support system                     simulation, animated simulation, user interface development,                    expert systems, CAD, and AM, all with adequate speed, storage,                  and graphics.  The significance of this project is twofold.                     First, results of recent faculty and graduate student research                  will be transferred to the undergraduate upper level thereby                    enhancing the curriculum.  Second, the mechanisms for this                      transfer will be available for study; to help develop the                       pedagogical means for facilitating inter-level transfer in other                topical areas.",
