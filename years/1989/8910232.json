This award will allow the                principal investigator to begin to assess the emergence of church and           military participation in politics and the influence of this                    politicization on regime change.The investigator will develop a                 strategy for comparing the experiences of the Roman Catholic Church and         the Armed Forces in the Phillipines with those in several Latin                 American countries.  As a pilot project, this research builds on                research and fieldwork conducted in the Phillipines and focuses on              expanding the study to several Latin American countries.                                                                                                        The investigator has a solid background for this type of research and           the issues to be addressed are both timely and important.  There is             good reason to believe that, consistent with the objectives of the              Research Opportunities for Women Program, this award may result in a            successful follow-up proposal.",
