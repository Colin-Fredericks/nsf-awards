 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between a group of               U.S. and Belgian biochemists.  The U.S. investigators are Dr. N. P.             Higgins, University of Alabama at Birmingham and Dr. Martin Pato,               University of Colorado Health Science Center.  The Belgian                      researcher is Dr. Ariane Toussaint, Free University of Brussels.                The long range goal of this project is to understand regulation of              genetic transposition in bacterial populations.                                                                                                                 The Mu transposase and semi-essential genes participate in a highly             efficient replication-transposition reaction in vivo.  In this                                                               __ ____                            project, experiments will be performed to analyze the transposase               and early genes that influence Mu biology at the stages of the                  transcription and DNA synthesis.  Objectives of the collaborative               work include i) expression, ii) purification and iii)                           characterization of DNA binding proteins encoded by the virus.  The             investigators will extend joint efforts to chromosome-associated                proteins (HU and other \"histone-like\" proteins) of E. coli and                                                                     _  ____                      Salmonella typhimurium.  This approach will expand basic knowledge              __________ ___________                                                          of the chromosomal proteins that organize a functional folded                   nucleoid.  The three investigators run laboratories that have                   demonstrated complementary expertise in all of the areas to be                  studied.  Systems involving purified proteins for analyzing Mu                  transcription and replication in vitro are established in                                                     __ _____                                          Birmingham.  Methods for analyzing Mu transcription and replication             in vivo are established in Denver.  The group in Brussels has                   genetic strategies for selecting mutants and carrying out the                   genetic dissection of proteins related to Mu biology.  By                       coordinating experiments at the three sites, the investigators can              test a hypothesis genetically and measure predicted behavior in                                                                              ___                vitro and in vivo in a relatively short period of                               _____     _______                                                               time.",
