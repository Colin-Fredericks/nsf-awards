Klaas Villanueva, Working Group on Earth Disaster                           Prevention, Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia, for                     24 months, a study of the tectonics of the Indonesian                           archipelago, using measurements of the Global Positioning                       System (GPS).  In the first year, they will study                               deformation associated with oblique plate convergence in                        Sumatra.  Specifically, they will examine the mechanism of                      decoupling of the oblique slip into normal subduction and                       shear slip on faults parallel to the convergent margin by                       measuring the deformation both southwest and northeast of                       the Sumatran fault zone.  The long-range goal of this                           project is extend GPS measurements across the entire                            Indonesian archipelago, concentrating on specific tectonic                      problems such as the distribution and rates of slip                             associated with arc-continent collision in the Banda arc in                     eastern Indonesia.                                                                                                                                              In the Indonesian region, many tectonic processes that                          result in mountain building, continental accretion,                             destruction of continents, displacement of ophiolites,                          development of subduction zones, arc polarity reversal,                         basin closure, etc. are now active.  This project will                          provide U.S. scientists a unique opportunity to observe                         such phenomena.  Because Indonesia lies in a zone of high                       seismicity and volcanic activity, monitoring of crustal                         deformations has potential humanitarian and economic value                      as well.  The U.S. and Indonesian collaborators are highly                      respected scientists who have records of successful                             research in the field of this project.  The present project                     will allow the collaborators to combine their talents and                       interests for mutual benefit.  This project is relevant to                      the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries                           Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation                        between U.S. scientists and engineers and their                                 counterparts in developing countries through the exchange                       of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques                        and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.                        Primary support for this project is provided by NSF Grant                       No. EAR8817067, the Indonesian government, and the World                        Bank.",
