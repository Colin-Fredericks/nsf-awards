 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on past seasons of archaeological fieldwork, Dr. Jon                   Muller and his colleagues will continue excavation at the site of               Great Salt Spring located on the Saline River in Southern                       Illinois.  Occupied during the Mississippian period (ca. 900 -                  1500 A.D.), this large complex site served as a focus for salt                  production.  Consisting of a bluff area overlying a salt spring,                excavation in the spring area has revealed large amounts of                     utilitarian pottery which was used to extract salt from the                     saline water.  Salt was much valued as a trade item.  Much less                 is known about the habitation area situated on the overlying                    bluff, and Dr. Muller will conduct both survey and excavation in                this area.  This will consist of mapping followed by auger, soil                probe, and small-scale shovel testing.  Based on the results, a                 sampling strategy will be formulated and followed by small scale                excavation.  Promising areas will then be excavated at a larger                 scale.                                                                                                                                                          The goal of this research is to set salt production into a                      broader social context.  Mississippian society reached a                        chieftain scale of organization, where an egalitarian society had               developed into a more hierarchical form of organization.                        Archaeologists disagree, however, on whether at this scale of                   centralization specialization of labor takes place or whether                   specific tasks, such as salt production, are carried out by                     \"ordinary\" group members on a part time basis.  Excavation in                   habitation areas at Great Salt Spring should help to answer this                question.                                                                                                                                                       This research is important because it increases our understanding               of how complex societies such as our own develop.                               Anthropologists know that as population increases and societal                  organization becomes more hierarchical, at some point craft                     specialization emerges.  Just when this occurs, however, is                     unclear.  It has been postulated that Mississippian salt making                 stands as an early example.  This contention, however, has been                 disputed and Dr. Muller's work should provide an answer.  It will               also increase our understanding of an important but poorly                      understood chapter of Native American prehistory.",
