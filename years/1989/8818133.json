 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are:  (1) to understand the                 ecology of anoxygenic phototrophs in microbial mats and in                      particular, the causes of the sequence of layers of anoxygenic                  phototrophic bacteria in complex multi-layered microbial mat                    communities; (2) to isolate and characterize the ubiquitous                     filamentous phototroph, Chloroflexus, from intertidal and                       hypersaline mats; (3) to isolate and characterize the previously                undescribed filimentous bacteriochlorophyll a - containing                      phototrophs from translucent thermal mats.  These prokaryotic                   communities found in extreme environments are modern analogs of                 extensive stromatolitic communities that dominated the biosphere                during the Precambrian.  An understanding of the physiology and                 ecology of the phototrophs comprising these modern mat                          communities gives us insight into the nature of the environmental               conditions and the microorganisms that comprised the ancient mats               that existed on earth from 0.5 to 3.5 billion years ago.                             These objectives will be met by conducting field studies on                thermal and intertidal mats where multi-layered communities                     exist.  The effects of oxygen, sulfide, and light on layering                   sequences will be determined by comparing oxygen, sulfide, and                  light microprofiles in adjacent mats that exhibit different                     layering sequences.                                                                  Direct isolation, gradient culture, and selective enrichment               techniques will be used to isolate the marine Chloroflexus and                  undescribed thermophilic filamentous phototroph.                                Characterization of these isolates will be done to determine                    their relationship to known strains and their significance as                   descendents of ancient stromatolite-forming phototrophs.",
