Preliminary activities to be                 done during the planning period include the following:                               1) Synthesis of the nitrosyl halides and ozone.                                 2) Design and construction of a vacuum system that will allow                   the preparation of the reactants                                                3) Modify the designs of a cryostat to prepare clean matrices                   and to allow the transportation of samples from the FT-IR to                    the UV-Vis spectrometer.                                                        4) Adaptation of the departmental FT-IR to fit the cryostat                     5) Modification of laboratory space so as to provide adequate                   electrical requirements, water requirements, and ventilation                    for the vacuum equipment.",
