 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main focus of this research will be on the relationship,               via variously defined trace maps, between K-theory and the free                 loop space.  Several basic problems in geometry, algebra and                    differential topology hinge on a better understanding of this                   connection.  These include the isomorphism conjecture of P. Baum                and A. Connes and those that it implies (e.g., the Novikov and                  Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjectures), the Bass conjecture on the                image of the Hattori-Stallings trace map for group rings, and the               Milnor-Friedlander conjecture concerning the K-theory of a Banach               algebra with coefficients in a finite abelian group.  The free                  loop space also plays an important role in understanding the                    homotopy-type of the space of stable pseudo-isotopies of a                      manifold, and variants seem to be closely related to the integral               relative K-theory of nilpotent ideals.  The planned work builds                 on progress in these areas; in particular, the investigator's                   solution of the KABI and Karoubi conjectures (with Weibel), new                 information on the integral relative K-theory of spaces, and a                  formulation of the operator algebra K-theory of spaces (with P.                 Baum and A. Connes).                                                                 Among the algebraic theories which make it possible to                     compute answers to topological questions about spaces are the                   various so-called K-theories.  The essence of this project is to                establish relations among these K-theories and between them and                 some other algebraic theories for dealing with topology.",
