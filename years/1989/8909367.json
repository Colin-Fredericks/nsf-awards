 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Career Advancement Award supported under the Research                 Opportunities for Women Program and the Economics Program.  The                 broad purpose of this type of award is to enable promising women                scholars to increase their research productivity.  With this                    award, the investigator will concentrate on acquiring graduate                  level training in economics.  The investigator's field of                       expertise is agricultural history of the Soviet Union.  This                    training will allow her to incorporate economic analysis into her               study of the Soviet Union.  The investigator has already gathered               a rich, village level data set of agriculture in general and also               of nonagricultural employment in three districts in Northern                    Russia.  Her research will focus on nineteenth century labor                    migration using these and other data.  An analytical framework                  will be developed to measure the impact of peasant migration on                 the village community, on rural development, and the process of                 industrial development during the nineteenth century.  This                     research is particularly important for developing a better                      understanding of the economic development process.",
