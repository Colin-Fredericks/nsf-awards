 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the recent dramatic increase in available computing power,             numerical optimization has become an attractive tool for the design             of complex engineering systems.  However, use of these techniques in            design has been hindered by (i) the difficulty to translate in a                faithful manner the actual design problem into mathematical                     optimization problem, (ii) the inability of classical optimization              tools to efficiently take into account the many distinctive features            of optimization problems arising in a design context, and (iii) the             unavailability of software tools offering to the designer a powerful            as well as congenial environment supporting such capabilities.                      The investigators seek an optimization-based design methodology             that accommodates the inherent trade-off driven character of most               design problems.  This methodology calls extensively upon the                   designer's knowledge and experience and emphasizes man-machine                  interaction.",
