 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at understanding the composition, origin                 and evolution of the continental crust.  The general approach                   used is the study of the geochemical and isotopic composition of                terrigenous sedimentary rocks.  Results over the past several                   years have shown that well behaved systematic behavior exists in                the geochemistry of terrigenous sediments that is controlled by a               number of factors.  Included are sedimentary processes, such as                 weathering and diagenesis, and provenance considerations,                       commonly related to plate tectonic associations.  In detail                     however, quantitative understanding of these controlling factors,               at a level that allows predictive modelling, remains elusive.                   The potential of this research is great.  The relationship                      between average sediment composition and average upper crustal                  composition provides important constraints on overall crustal                   composition and permits examination of such compositions through                time.  The crust, generally considered to have been derived from                the mantle is a major geochemical reservoir for many elements                   and, accordingly, such study has direct relevance for studies of                mantle and bulk earth evolution.  On a more practical level, the                study of trace element and isotopic composition in terrigenous                  sedimentary rocks provides a great deal of additional                           information, required to quantify relationships between                         sedimentation and tectonics, than is provided by traditional                    approaches of sedimentary petrography.",
