 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will assess the effects of maternal caregiving on                  the health and nutritional status of children in a marginal rural               area of highland Mexico.  The relationships of mothering                        performance to socio-economic and demographic characteristics of                households will be examined through the creation of statistical                 models for children of differing age levels in a massive data                   base of the Collaborative Research Support Program on Food Intake               and Function in Mexico.  Measures of maternal caregiving,                       household demographic and economic characteristics, and                         indicators of child health and nutrition will be derived from                   this data.                                                                                                                                                      This project is important because it will help us understand why                some children in households have better health and nutritional                  status than other children in the same wealth categories.                       Obviously poverty is not the only cause of health and well being,               and this research will help us understand the parts of the                      relationship having to do with maternal behavior.",
