 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of women's entrance into male-dominated professions                 such as law and medicine provides a unique and powerful framework               for understanding the dynamics of professionalization and gender                in society.  While the profession of medicine has attracted much                attention from historians and has resulted in several scholarly                 works, the history of women in the American legal profession has                not been scientifically explored.                                                                                                                               This project will provide the first quantitative, historical                    analysis of women lawyers in modern American society.  A profile                of several generations of women lawyers will be compiled with the               analysis focusing on long-term social, demographic, educational,                family, and professional characteristics.  In addition to                       aggregate census data, the primary data sets for the study                      include (1) a survey of approximately 300 women lawyers                         undertaken in 1920 by the Bureau of Vocational Information; (2)                 professional digests published in 1939 and 1949; and (3) the                    Martindale-Hubbell Law Directories of practicing women laywers.                 These sources will yield invaluable statistical information on                  the socio-economic characteristics, attitudes, and career                       patterns of these women.  The emphasis in the analysis of the                   three data sets will be on generational and cohort effects.  By                 utilizing data bases that examine individual women lawyers, the                 study is able to reconstruct generational cohorts of women                      lawyers, and analyze long-term social change in the legal                       profession.                                                                                                                                                     This study will contribute significantly to the growing body of                 scholarly knowledge of the history of the legal profession and                  the professionalization of women in America.  It will move the                  history of women lawyers beyond the traditional focus on women                  lawyers and the obstacles imposed by legal doctrine to focus on                 women lawyers in society at large.  In doing so, the study will                 expand the parameters of scientific work on legal history and the               legal profession.",
