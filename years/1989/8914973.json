 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed at increasing the number of Historically Black         Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) involved in VLSI CAD-related                 teaching and research.  More specifically, appropriate faculty from             selected HBCU's will be identified to serve as the focal point for              their universities VLSI activities.  These participants will attend the         2nd Annual VLSI Education Conference and Exposition which will provide          a forum for communication between educators, industrial                         representatives, government sponsors and vendors in areas of common             interest in VLSI education.  The targeted HBCU's are:  Tuskeegee                University, Southern University, North Carolina A&T State University,           Howard University, Hampton University and Prairie View A&M University.                                                                                          The benefits of this effort are twofold.  First, faculty participants           from the HBCU's will gain ideas on course and laboratory development,           research opportunities, access to contacts throughout the country, etc.         Secondly, it is anticipated that these faculty will serve as the                catalysts for involving HBCU's more aggressively in the national focus          on VLSI.",
