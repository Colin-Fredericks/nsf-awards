 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge in cell biological research today is to                       understand how numbers of component biological molecules interact               within complex systems to carry out fundamental cellular                        functions.  Frequently these systems correspond to large,                       nonsymmetrical structural assemblies, extending from thousands to               tens of thousands of angstroms within the cell, whose function is               intimately related to their underlying structural architecture,                 Newly developed techniques of electron microscopy tomography and                light microscopy optical sectioning are capable of providing                    detailed 3-dimensional reconstructions of such assemblies at                    overlapping resolution.  This grant is for the acquisition of a                 light microscopy optical sectioning workstation to complete an                  image analysis facility capable of carrying out 3-dimensional                   reconstructions at both the light and electron microscopy                       resolution level.  The light microscopy station described will                  allow 3-dimensional structure determination within living cells                 and tissues.                                                                                                                                                    These capabilities represent a vital resource to the research                   programs of the facility's users.  This research is focused on                  large-scale chromosome structure and nuclear organization, the                  role of cytoskeleton and function in modulating key events in                   Drosophila embryonic development (major users), the specific                    structural coupling between the extracellular matrix and the                    cytoskeleton and its regulatory role in cell growth,                            differentiation, and migration, and mapping of neural networks                  (minor users).",
