 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large number of industrial processes involve chemical reactions               between reactive groups which are attached to high molecular weight             flexible polymers.  Examples includes:  (1) the production of linear            chains by radical and condensation polymerization;                              (2) the manufacture of rubber elastomers and gels by                            cross-linking long polymer chains either chemically or through the              action of high energy radiation; and (3) reactive processing methods            producing high strength composites.  While small molecule reactions             also occur in these situations, the main difficulty concerns the                macromolecular reactions since the ability of reactive species to meet          is determined by the dynamical and static properties of the polymers            to which they are attached.  The objective of this research is to               determine a fundamental mechanism for these processes by calculating            reaction rates for the case when two long unbranched polymers each              carrying one active group located somewhere along their respective              backbones, such that if ever the two groups are brought to within a             certain distance of one another ( the \"capture radius\") they will               react with certain probability per unit time.  The two polymer coils            must diffuse through space and then penetrate one another                       significantly before reaction may proceed (typical polymer coil and             capture radius dimensions are 300 Angstroms and 10 Angstroms                    respectively).                                                                                                                                                  The PI is planning to  develop a molecular theory of reaction                   rates between high molecular weight polymers in solution and to                 predict reactions rates as a function of polymer molecular weight               and concentration for polymers in dilute, semi-dilute (where                    polymers overlap strongly giving rise to some concentration                     effects) and dense solutions (melt).  The reaction rates are                    dependent on concentration because if the polymers are dilute in                a monomeric background, the coils diffuse relatively quickly                    through space but strongly repel one another on close encounter,                while if the chains are dense (in a melt) and long, such                        repulsions are screened but diffusion is drastically slowed down                by entanglements.  An additional outcome expected of this                       research is that it will increase knowledge about the nature of                 an equilibrium system to which irreversible reactions are added                 (polymer reactions are an example of a non-equilibrium thermal                  system).",
