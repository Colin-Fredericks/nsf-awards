 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wavelets are families of functions generated from one single function           (or, in higher dimensions, from a finite set of functions) by                   dilations and translations.  Particularly interesting are discrete              families of wavelets that span all of L2(Rn), and lead to numerically           stable decomposition + reconstruction algorithms.  Such families can            either be redundant (frames) or not (bases).  For certain frames or             bases of wavelets, there exist easily implementable, elegant tree-              algorithms for the numerical computation of decomposition                       coefficients.  Dr. Daubechies will investigate how these can be used            to solve wave equations numerically.  Wavelets seem very promising for          this purpose for both theoretical and practical reasons, since they             are inherently a tool for microlocalization and have been used as such          in singular integral problems, while they also incorporate the idea of          different scales and \"zoom-in\" on singularities, similar to refining            grid techniques in numerical analysis.  A successful use of wavelets            for this purpose would lead to better orientation specificity than is           available in presently used numerical techniques.                                                                                                               The interactive activities involve teaching a graduate course and               participating in seminars.                                                                                                                                      This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and  (2) to encourage               women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing                 greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in               industry, government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the            participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
