 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lightly reinforced concrete members are widely used in practice.                In spite of their widespread use, there has been very little                    research regarding the shear capacity of these members,                         especially continuous members and members with tapered webs such                as joists.  Limited research indicates that the shear capacity of               lightly reinforced members is below that predicted by current                   design procedures.  Thus, these structural components appear to                 have a lower margin of safety than other components of reinforced               concrete structures.  The current research will determine the                   shear strength of continuous, lightly reinforced T.beams and                    joists.  Both single web and triple web members will be tested.                 The effects of flexural reinforcement ratio, degree of shear                    reinforcement, and load sharing between joists will be                          considered.  The cracking shears will be compared with existing                 empirical and analytical expressions.  The contribution of                      concrete, shear reinforcement, dowel action and aggregate                       interlock to shear strength will be estimated.  Modifications to                current design expressions will be developed.  The research will                fill a major gap in current understanding and allow the                         formulation of rational design provisions.  The research will                   result in improved safety for an important class for reinforced                 concrete structural components.",
