 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by ten U.S.                   scientists in a symposium on \"Mechanistic Aspects of                            Biological Oxidation Reactions\" to be held at the Indian                        Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, India in October,                       1989.  The U.S. team leader is Dr. C. Channa Reddy, Department                  of Chemistry, Pennsylvania State University.  The Indian                        co-organizer is Dr. K.M. Madyasth, Department of Organic                        Chemistry at IISc.  The symposium is planned to exchange                        information and results of recent research on the various                       enzyme catalyzed reactions of oxygen and those of its                           reduction products.  Enzymes catalyzing reactions of Oxygen                     and Hydrogen Peroxide are wide-spread in nature and are                         responsible for a variety of reactions and metabolic pathways,                  and are therefore important for commercial applications.  The                   meeting will address questions such as the common structural                    and mechanistic features that allow enzymes with different                      requirements to carry out virtually identical reactions, the                    exact structures of important intermediates in various enzyme                   oxidations, and the characteristics of individual enzymes that                  allow the formation and stabilization of highly active                          intermediates.  The proceedings of the workshop are expected                    to be published by Academic Press.                                                                                                                              Scope:  The Indian organizers at the Indian Institute of                        Science are highly regarded scientists.  They have the backing                  of the Indian Government and the State Government as well as                    support from Industry.  The Indian organizers are covering all                  the local costs for the U.S. participants who are leading                       researchers in the field.  It is expected that the symposium                    will benefit U.S. and Indian participants and open avenues for                  future collaboration.",
