 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the discipline of chemistry, broadly defined,                with a specific focus on education and human resources.  The                    thrust of this activity is a multi-part workshop, symposium, panel              discussion, and outreach activity that is designed to acquaint                  women faculty members and students in the Southeastern United                   States with career opportunities in chemistry and Foundation                    programs that are structured to enhance the research careers of                 women scientists and engineers.  Dr. Alice Cunningham, Kenan                    Professor of Chemistry and Chairperson of the Department of                     Chemistry at Agnes Scott College, will contact some 450                         institutions of higher learning in the 10-state southeastern                    region of the U.S. and informing them that four outstanding women               scientists will describe their research programs and discuss                    career opportunities for women in chemistry at a symposium that                 will be held on Friday afternoon, March 3, 1989, at Agnes Scott                 College.  Additionally, NSF staff will conduct an ROW Outreach on               the morning of March 3, 1989, preceding the symposium.                                                                                                          This project will contribute to the infrastructure of science by                showcasing the achievements of women in chemistry and cast those                women as effective role models for the women students who will                  attend the symposium.  The participants in the symposium  are                   particularly well-suited to this activity in that two of them                   (Cunningham and Morse) are members of the American Chemical                     Society's Committee on Professional Training and two others (Dixon              and Lester) are currently NSF Research Opportunities for Women-                 Career Advancement Award grantees.  Additionally, the focussed                  inclusion of minority (e.g., Spellman College) and numerous                     undergraduate institutions among the invitees is a particularly                 important aspect of this activity.",
