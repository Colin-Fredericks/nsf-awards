 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and implement an exemplary secondary school           science teacher preparation program which features inquiry-oriented,            interdisciplinary science.  The instructional practices to be introduced        into the new and newly modified courses will stem from the research on          cognitive structure and conceptual change.  Three new courses will be           included in that program: a three credit upper-division inquiry based           interdisciplinary Science/Technology/Society course required of all             liberal arts majors and all prospective science teachers; a one credit          seminar in cognitive structure and teaching practices which foster              conceptual change; and a nine credit teaching practicum, which will             involve preservice teachers in planning, conducting, and evaluating             selected model lessons and inquiry laboratories.  The teaching practicum        course development team will include four high school science teachers.         Thus the project will be a collaborative venture between the Colleges of        Education and Science at Utah State University and secondary school             science teachers from selected school districts.                                                                                                                The cost sharing for the project will be 30 percent of the NSF portion.",
