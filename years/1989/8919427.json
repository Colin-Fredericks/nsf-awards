 "awd_abstract_narration": "Achieving a successful career in science requires more than the                 creative process of planning important experiments and the                      expertise to execute them precisely.  Traditionally, the training               of scientists is an apprenticeship process; thesis-advisors and                 postdoctoral mentors are guides and role models for the young                   scientist.  For women and minorities this process, which depends                so heavily on a personal \"friendship\", often fails.  The culture                and process of science must be made available to all scientists                 so that they may take positive steps to advance in their careers.               The proposed workshop is designed for women and minorities who                  are just establishing their independence as scientists, i.e.                    who are holding their first research grants.  This early stage in               a career is especially precarious; departmental and teaching                    demands are an absolute requirement.  Despite the large                         investment in education and training made, this stage in the                    scientific careers of women and minorities often is their last.                 This workshop will address the following aspects of careers in                  biological sciences:  1) tenure and promotion; 2) grants and                    publications; 3) the culture of science; 4) effective                           communication.  In addition, a critique of the workshop will be                 conducted so that it may serve as a prototype for future                        workshops directed toward the greater participation of women and                minorities at higher levels of science and engineering careers.                                                                                                 The goal of this workshop is to present women and minority                      scientists with some of the tools required to advance scientific                careers.  This is expected to be a prototype conference to help                 establish tested formats for the dissemination of professional                  advancement skills to these groups which have been traditionally                under-represented in the upper levels of scientific careers, but                who will constitute the greater part of the future workforce in                 the United States.",
