 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studying under Dr. Frank L. Parker of Vanderbilt University, Dr.                McCabe in examining the role of quality assurance in high-level                 radioactive waste management.  Dr. Parker is a world leader in                  the development of the basic information required for the safe                  disposal of high-level radioactive waste. Dr. McCabe's doctoral                 dissertation research was on the process by which science and                   technology policy decisions are reached in a democratic system.                                                                                                 It is increasingly apparent that science and technology policy                  makers are developing more open institutional arrangements, so                  that their decisions are perceived as legitimate.  As a                         consequence of this more open system of decision making,                        scientific and technical experts are being held to unprecedented                standards of accountability in terms of research methodology.                   Thus, scientists are becoming important actors in a frequently                  contentious political process.                                                                                                                                  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act,passed by Congress in 1982, is the                 first comprehensive national policy to address high-level                       radioactive waste disposal.  Since Congress amended the Act in                  December, 1987, the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of                Civilian Radioactive Waste Management has focused its efforts on                preparing site characterization plans for a proposed geological                 repository at Nevada's Yucca Mountain.                                                                                                                          As a component of its site characterization plan, the DOE has                   initiated an aggressive quality assurance (QA) program.  The                    program has met resistance from a segment of the scientific                     community, including some of DOE's scientific contractors,                      charging that QA regulations designed for construction of                       engineered facilities cannot be applied to earth science                        investigations.   Dr. McCabe will be working with Dr. Parker over               the next two years under this postdoctoral fellowship to examine                systematically the conflict between DOE and the scientists                      carrying out field investigations,particularly the implications                 of this case for subsequent science and technology policy                       decision.  She will conduct personal interviews with DOE                        officials and contractors, Nuclear Regulatory Commission                        personnel and other major actors affiliated with the QA program.                She will thoroughly examine the QA literature and supporting                    documents to complete the database.",
