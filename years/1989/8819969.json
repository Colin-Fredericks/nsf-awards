 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mammalian pineal gland receives information concerning the                  external environment via the nervous system and this is                         translated to the endocrine system.  This function serves to                    coordinate the adaption of internal bodily response to the                      outside environment.  The best known environmental signal                       received by the pineal gland is photoperiod.  The pattern of                    daylight versus darkness characterizes the time of the year and                 predicts external, seasonal changes.  Dr. Prechel has discovered                a seasonal cycle of a neuropeptide in the pineal gland.  This                   arginine vasotocin-like neuropeptide increases dramatically for a               short time during mid-August each year in a number of species.                  Dr. Prechel will collect this peptide during August and then                    characterize and chemically identify it so that studies of its                  biological usefulness can proceed.  In addition, she will                       determine how the animals \"sense\" when it is August by                          determining which component of our surroundings is capable of                   causing changes in hormones in the brain.  An understanding of                  biological rhythms provides new insights into how humans adapt to               changes in their external environment and will lead to the                      development of better treatments for problems such as jet lag,                  rotating work shifts and Seasonal Affective Disorder or \"winter                 depression.\"",
