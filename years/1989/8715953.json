 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ohio University has several researchers who would benefit                 from access to supercomputers and access to other researchers                   connected to the NSFNET.  These scientists constitute a growing                 number of faculty and graduate students who require advanced                    computing facilities in order to carry out their research.  The                 campus requests a portion of the funds needed for equipment for                 connection to the NSFNET through the State of Ohio communication                network centered at Ohio State University.                                                                                                                        Consistent with the NSFNET Program policy regarding connection                to existing mid-level networks, this grant is an award of $20,000               for routing equipment at the campus, which will be used as a                    gateway to networks external to the campus.  Connections to the                 Ohio State University hub will be provided by Ohio University.                  Ohio State University is connected to the NSFNET Backbone network               as member of the the CICNET regional (multicampus) network and as               such has computer communication capability with all institutions                currently connected to the nation research network, NSFNET.",
