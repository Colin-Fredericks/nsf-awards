 "awd_abstract_narration": "At Paul Smith's College, a two year college of arts and                    sciences there are both pre-baccalaureate programs and                          technically oriented programs in Environmental Science and                      Forestry which help students develop skills and attitudes                       necessary to solve problems, in the areas of pollution control                  and resource conservation.  Environmental Science and Forestry                  graduates are regularly admitted to four year programs with full                junior status, while those who elect to enter directly into                     employment benefit from the technical skills they have developed                through the use of analytical equipment.  There currently include               gas chromatography, HPLC, and atomic absorption spectroscopy.                   Ion chromatography is an important technique for this kind of                   program since the Dionex Ion Chromatograph has been specified by                the Environmental Protection Agency as the method of choice for                 anions and acid rain studies.  With this system our students are                instructed in the newest techniques of analysis.  The institution               is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
