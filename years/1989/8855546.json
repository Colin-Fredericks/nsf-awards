 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed project is to provide one week of                   intensive inservice during the summer of 1989 and follow-up                     supportive activities to 60 high school mathematics teachers.                   The goal of the inservice activities is to prepare the                          teachers to use a computer and calculator based approach to                     the teaching and learning of high school algebra,                               trigonometry, and analytic geometry.  This approach  is                         consistent with the new Standards for School Mathematics                        Curriculum and Evaluation of the National Council of Teachers                   of Mathematics. The techniques and technology used in the                       currently funded (Ohio Board of Regents, British Petroleum of                   Ohio, and NSF) Ohio State University Calculator and Computer                    Precalculus Project (C2PC) are almost directly applicable to                    other high school mathematics courses and will be used to                       focus the week's inservice activities.  Most mathematics                        teachers have not used an approach that require them to use                     computer and/or calculator based graphing to enhance the                        teaching and learning of mathematics.  There is a great need                    to provide mathematics teachers inservice supportive of the                     classroom activities and the approach to mathematics that is                    a consequence of the use of technology.                                                                                                                         This project has a budget of $103,335 and has cost sharing of                   66%.",
