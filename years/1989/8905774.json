 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to contribute to the                        understanding of the processes that control community structure,                productivity and abundance of planktonic organisms in lakes.  It                will maintain the continuity of a long-term study of Lake                       Washington that was started in 1949 and has been continuous since               1961.  The response of the lake to an earlier episode of                        pollution with secondary sewage effluent and its recovery after                 diversion showed that the lake could respond promptly to changes                in input of nutrients.  The goal now is to measure the way the                  biological and chemical conditions of lake change in response to                natural variations in external factors such as weather and                      hydrology, and to various kinds of human activity.  The major                   changes are expected to be in land development and management of                fisheries.  The result will provide a useful base for evaluating                the effect of foreseen future changes.  Changes in biological and               chemical conditions in 1988 suggest that the lake is currently                  being affected by changes in land use.  A study of the new                      conditions and an attempt to identify the specific causes and                   processes of change should be rewarding for both scientific and                 practical purposes.",
