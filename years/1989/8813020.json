 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project it is proposed to study the enthalpy and phase                  behavior of a model system, methanol (which is hydrogen bonding)                /n-pentane (non-polar)/acetone (polar), that is representative of               interactions present in mixtures containing a non-polar, a polar                and a hydrogen bonding compound.  Studies will be conducted at                  elevated temperatures (375 to 700 degrees K) and pressures (0.1                 to 10MPa) including the critical and supercritical regions.                     Primary measurements will be made in a Freon 11 reference fluid                 boil-off calorimeter, and an equilibrium flash vaporization                     apparatus, which have already been developed.  Additional                       measurements will be made in the critical region using a new                    automated flow calorimeter.  This system is studied in part                     because some phase behavior data are available for this system at               lower temperatures.  Enthalpy and phase behavior measurements                   will also be made for the three pure compounds, the three binary                mixtures, and selected compositions of the ternary.  This set of                data will be used as a standard for correlation of equations of                 state applicable for both phase behavior and enthalpy predictions of            such highly non-ideal mixtures.                                                                                                                                 Experimental results at subcritical conditions have recently been               obtained for a different ternary system--tetralin/quinoline/m-                  cresol.  Comparison of these results with correlations has shown                that present equation of state methods cannot be used to predict                both phase behavior and enthalpy of binary and ternary systems,                 containing polar associating compounds.  Therefore, equation of                 state development will continue, emphasizing perturbed hard body                equations, with the objective of developing equation of state                   methods that are applicable to non-ideal ternary mixtures that                  can serve as models of the complex systems often encountered in                 industrial practice.",
