The workshop will be coordinated by the IEEE Computer                Society.                                                                                                                                                        The department chairpersons will be formally organized into the                 Association of Computer Science/Engineering Departments at Minority             Institutions (ADMIS) which will prioritize its CISE program                     recommendations and assess institutional strengths and weaknesses in            the education and research areas supported by CISE.  The ADMIs will             provide an effective means for assessing the impact of CISE programs            and developing plans to strengthen these institutions.                                                                                                          Representatives from the Computing Science Accreditation Board (CSAB)           and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) will          make presentations regarding curriculum activities.  Invited                    participants will also include representatives from the Association of          Computer Machinery (ACM) and other government agencies with support             programs for minority institutions such as NASA, DOD and NIH.  An               attempt will be made to form a collaborative effort between Federal             Agencies to strengthen academic and research programs of minority               institutions.                                                                                                                                                   Over 60 minority Colleges and Universities are expected to be                   represented.",
