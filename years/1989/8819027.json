The prior grant was highly productive resulting               in more than twenty publications in refereed scientific journals                with more than five addition being prepared.  A summary of the                  significant accomplishments includes determination that the                     defect structure in barium titanate dielectrics was very                        dependent upon the processing of the material with little                       difference in stoichiometry noted; the defect structure of beta                 alumina solid electrolytes has both long range order and long                   range disorder which depends upon the stoichiometry and the                     thermal history; the mixed ion effect in beta alumina was                       explained and shown to be related to the defect structure                       (conductivity varies by as much as several thousand times for the               same material); solid electrolytes with more control of the                     structure and properties were synthesized using ion exchange                    techniques.  The renewal grant will emphasize research on                       increased understanding of the critical chemical factors                        affecting the structure and properties of oxide ceramics and on                 synthesis of new oxides using this understanding.  Materials                    being investigated include layered transition metal oxides,                     copper oxides, and lanthanide beta alumina.  Analytical                         techniques used include high resolution electron microscopy, x-                 ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy,                     thermal analysis, and electronic  characterization (conductivity,               dielectric loss, magnetic susceptibility).                                                                                                                           The materials being investigated have technological                        importance because of their potential application in thermal                    batteries, lasers, high temperature superconductors, dielectrics                for communications etc.",
