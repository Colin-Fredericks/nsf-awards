 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Haskell will investigate the index theory of                     elliptic Fredholm operators on certain noncompact manifolds, and                the index theory arising from actions of noncompact groups on                   manifolds. The former project will be particularly concerned with               the case in which the manifold is the smooth part of a singular                 algebraic variety. A general aim is to relate the behavior of                   indices to the global topology of the variety and to geometric                  information about the singularities. The second project will be                 approached via the crossed product construction from the theory                 of operator algebras. Elliptic operators in this setting give                   rise to maps on the K-groups of the crossed product algebra,                    whose nature Professor Haskell will attempt more precisely to                   elucidate. A fundamental object in the study of crossed products                is Kasparov's representation ring of a connected Lie group. This                ring can be realized as equivalence classes of almost                           intertwining Fredholm operators between unitary representations                 of the group. Professor Haskell will analyze the structure of                   this ring for certain semisimple groups by studying intertwining                operators with additional structure.                                                 Three fundamental subject areas in mathematics are involved                in this project, namely differential operators on manifolds, the                representation theory of Lie groups, and the theory of operator                 algebras. The first subject may be thought of as a far-reaching                 outgrowth of calculus on manifolds (surfaces and their higher-                  dimensional analogues). The operations of calculus, which are                   defined in terms of the geometry of the manifold (distance,                     curvature, and the like on a local scale) turn out to yield                     information about its topology (overall shape and conformation).                When the manifold arises algebraically, say as the zero set of a                polynomial, there is even more information that can be harvested                from studying differential operators. Lie groups, named after the               Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, are used by mathematicians                  and physicists to embody symmetry, roughly the totality of all                  allowable motions of a given situation that preserve its                        essential features. Lie groups often act on manifolds in                        interesting ways, and the important features of such an action                  can often be detected by certain differential operators. The                    theory of operator algebras, finally, provides a technical and                  conceptual framework within which apparently disparate                          mathematical structures can interact with one another.",
