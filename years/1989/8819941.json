 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two of the most significant threats to survival that animals face               come from variation in the food supply and in the ambient                       temperature.  Variations of both kinds are able to motivate major               protective actions on the part of animals, including humans.                    Endothermic (\"warm-blooded\") animals can use several strategies                 that blunt the challenge posed by these environmental conditions.               In particular, the endotherm can attempt to feed more                           efficiently, to improve the temperature of its surroundings, and                to change the amount of heat lost from its body surface by                      varying its insulation and by adjusting its body temperature.                   Strategies of these sorts have been studied in some endotherms                  during periods of food scarcity and of cold ambient temperatures,               but there has not been a suitable experimental situation in which               to study the ways endotherms use these responses to maximal                     advantage by sequencing them or by combining them.                                                                                                              Dr. Rashotte's research utilizes experimental procedures by which               this problem can by studied.  Pigeons are the endothermic animal                chosen for study because of the large amount of separate                        information available on their feeding and thermal responses.                   The research uses computer technology to measure the feeding and                thermal strategies of the birds in situations where the                         availability of food and the ambient temperature are varied.                    The work should result in a thorough description of how this                    endothermic animal copes with variations in the food supply and                 in cold ambient temperature.  This information should be useful                 in understanding the survival strategies of birds and of                        endotherms in general, and it should provide a basis for                        investigating the neural and hormonal bases of survival in these                environmental conditions.",
