 "awd_abstract_narration": "Good mechanical designs are often composed of highly-                      integrated, tightly-coupled components where the interactions                   among the components are essential to the function and economic                 execution of the design.  This assertion runs counter to design                 methodologies in other engineering fields, such as software                     design and circuit design, that advocate designs in which each                  component fulfills a single function with minimal interaction.                  Because of the geometry, weight, and cost of mechanical                         components, converting a single functional requirement into a                   single component is often both impractical and infeasible.  Each                component may contribute to the performance of more than one                    function, and the performance of each function may be distributed               over many components.  In fact, most mechanical components                      perform not only the desired function, but also many additional,                unintended functions.  In good mechanical designs, these                        additional functions often are exploited.                                            A formal methodology for mechanical design for transforming                the system functional requirements into a description of a                      realizable physical system is proposed.  It is the hypothesis                   that, by creating a formal description of the function of a                     limited set of mechanical designs and a corresponding description               of physical components, a description of a physical system that                 takes advantage of the multiple functions of its components can                 be generated.",
