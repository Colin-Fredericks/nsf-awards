 "awd_abstract_narration": "Construction estimating can benefit from the knowledge                          representation and manipulation capabilities of Knowledge-Based                 Expert Systems technology.  Construction Estimating also                        represents the transition between design and construction.                      Therefore, it can be enhanced by utilizing the object-oriented                  data representation capabilities of Computer Aided Design                       technology.  Horizontal integration of Computer Aided Design and                Knowledge-Based Expert Systems technologies should result in                    improved Construction Estimating.  Improved Construction                        Estimating can only occur if Knowledge-Based Expert Systems and                 Computer Aided Design technologies are adopted by a broad                       spectrum of users and not just the innovators group.  Therefore,                technology transfer methodologies to accelerate and foster their                adoption should be developed.  This basic research has two                      primary objectives:  1) Investigate Knowledge-Based Expert                      Systems and Computer Aided Design technologies for improved                     Construction Estimating; and 2) Investigate methods for                         expediting the transfer of Knowledge-Based Expert Systems and                   Computer Aided Design technologies to the Construction Estimating               process.",
