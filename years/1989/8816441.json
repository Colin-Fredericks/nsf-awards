 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research                           project in theoretical chemistry between Nada Miljevic at                       the Boris Kidrich Institute for Nuclear Science, Belgrade,                      and Alexander Van Hook at the University of Tennessee, the                      investigators will study isotope effects in solution. In                        particular, they propose to examine clay-mineral systems,                       carbon disulfide-methanol systems, and aqueous solutions.                       In addition to advancing knowledge on thermodynamics of                         solutions, these studies could have practical applications                      in industrial, geochemical and agricultural operations.  The                    U.S. and Yugoslav scientists have a previous history of                         successful collaboration on these topics.                                                                                                                       This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution  in Yugoslavia, but                        include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
