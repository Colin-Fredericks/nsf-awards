 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radio-frequency plasmas are used for a variety of processes including           uses in the semiconductor industry for plasma deposition and plasma             etching.  The plasma can be viewed as the combination of at least               three processes:                                                                     (1) a voltage is applied to one electrode while another one                     is grounded creating an electric field between the                              electrodes;                                                                     (2) the electric field accelerates electrons to very high                       energies (1 to 20 eV);                                                          (3) at those high energies, electrons react with  neutrally                     charged molecules to form more electrons, ions, free radical                    species, and excited molecules.                                                 (4) the free radicals react with each other, other gas phase                    molecules, or with the molecules on solid surfaces of the                       reactor; and                                                                    (5) ions are accelerated through the plasma sheathes to                         produce high energy bombardment (up to several hundred eV) of the               solid surfaces which influence the surface reactions occurring                  there.                                                                     At the present time the development and control of most etch and                deposition processes is mainly governed by empirical approaches that            examine the final effect created (such as etching rate, uniformity              across a wafer, etch directionally, etc.) as a function of the process          conditions (power, pressure, gas composition, frequency) for a                  particular reactor.  A more  fundamental understanding of a particular          process would speed up  the development process (especially of new              orsubstantially  different plasma processes) and aid in understanding           the control  of these processes.  To obtain such a fundamental                  understanding  and to ultimately model the whole system, a                      quantitative  understanding and/or measurement of each individual               process  occurring is needed.                                                                                                                                   The objectives of this research project are to establish and use  a             new method to determine electron concentrations as function of  time            in low frequency (40 - 400 Hz) discharges.  High frequency                      discharges produce faster etch and deposition rates while low                   frequency discharges produce higher ion bombardment energies of                 solid surfaces which leads to improved surface effect such as                   better etching directionality.  The PI's method involves                        perturbing the low frequency discharge with high frequency                      signals, and then measuring and analyzing the high-frequency                    impedance as a function of time within the low frequency cycle.                 These impedances will be interpreted in terms of the plasma as an               electrical circuit to give the electron concentrations in the                   discharge as a function of time.  The technique will allow                      experimenters to determine quantitatively the electron                          concentrations occurring in specific etching or deposition                      discharges.  Electron concentration measurements will help in                   predicting rates of the electron-molecule reactions occurring in                the plasma reactor.  These measurements can be combined with                                                                                                                                                                                    other information to determine the ultimate effects on etching or               deposition rates and characteristics.",
