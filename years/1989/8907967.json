 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Berkeley Primate Skeletal Collection, housed in the Lowie                   Museum of the University of California, Berkeley, contains the                  skeletal remains of over 11,000 individuals, both humans as well                as prosimians, monkeys, and apes.  With prior NSF support,                      significant work has been done to remedy cataloging and storage                 problems which have existed since the inception of the collection               in 1901.  The team headed by Dr. Benedict now plans to complete                 the curation of skeletal remains recovered from archaeological                  contexts in both Egypt and California.  At the completion of this               project, the collection should be maximally useful to concerned                 scientists.                                                                                                                                                     Skeletal materials are of importance to a wide range of                         researchers.  They allow reconstruction of human prehistory and                 allow scientists to trace both population movements and changes                 within single groups over time.  They can be used to answer a                   number of important health questions which relate physical                      wellbeing including nutrition, crowding, and social organization.               With such materials scientists can learn how changes in diet                    affect physical growth and mortality.  It is possible to                        determine how inadequate nutrition at different ages affects                    growth and, for obvious ethical reasons, such studies can and                   should not be conducted on present day populations.                                                                                                             This project is important because it will make a significant set                of data available not only to anthropologists but also to a much                wider range of interested scientists.",
