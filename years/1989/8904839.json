This research investigates a newly                       discovered adaptive response which contributes to survival of                   these bacteria in acid environments.  The acidification                         tolerance response (ATR) is induced when cells are shifted                      from pH 7.4 to pH 5.8 for one doubling.  Subsequent exposure                    of the adapted cells and unadapted cells to pH 3.3 results in                   a rapid, logarithmic death of the unadapted cells but marked                    survival of adapted cells.                                                                                                                                      This research investigates the ATR phenomenon at the                            biochemical, genetic and molecular levels.  Experiments                         include measuring the internal pH, buffering capacity, proton                   influx and proton efflux of pH 5.8 adapted vs. unadapted                        cells and examining polypeptides produced during adaptation.                    To initiate the genetic studies, a series of selective                          procedures have been developed to screen for ATR-related                        acid-resistant and supersensitive mutants.  Each mutant gene                    must affect adaptive acid tolerance, alter the expression of                    specific ATR polypeptides and be defective in the adaptive                      acid tolerance mechanism(s) identified during the biochemical                   investigations.%%%                                                                                                                                              This system of adaptive acid tolerance is most certainly of                     major importance to Salmonella in surviving acid environments                   both in nature and in an infected host.  The multifaceted                       study presented here will open exciting new areas of research                   into how other organisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic,                      handle acid stress.***//",
