 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disruption of the cell envelope is one of the first steps                  in the recovery of materials contained within microbial cells.                  Conventional techniques typically involve high shear, heat                      generation, and multiple stage processing, all factors which                    can lead to degradation of the desired product.  Furthermore,                   these techniques often lead to the creation of small cell wall                  fragments which adds to the burden of downstream purification.                  This work suggests a method of cell disruption which may avoid                  these difficulties, improve product yields, and prove more                      economical as well.  The method, a modified form of explosive                   decompression, is based on the large specific volume changes                    which may be rapidly effected upon depressurization of a                        supercritical fluid or low-boiling liquid.  Any process                         requiring microbial cell disruption may benefit significantly                   from the proposed explosive disruption method.                                       Downstream processing accounts for 50 percent to 80                        percent of the total cost in the production of most                             bioproducts.  The development of this technique for cell                        disruption could lead to the economical recovery of many                        important proteins for human health care that will otherwise be                 neglected.",
