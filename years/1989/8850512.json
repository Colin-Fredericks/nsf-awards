 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide the science content and process information           necessary to update the knowledge base of forty middle and junior high          school science teachers in earth, physical and consumer science.                Participants will then apply this information as they implement state-          mandated changes in the science curriculum.  Through interaction and            experiences, these teachers will build confidence and interest in               providing current information and quality laboratory experiences for            these students.                                                                                                                                                 The format for meeting these objectives consists of a four-week summer          program and two seminars during the ensuing academic year.  Sessions            will be held on the campus of The University of Mississippi.  The summer        program will be devoted to lecture-discussion-demonstrations conducted          by University scientists.  Participants will also perform laboratory            science experiments, both individually and in small groups to gain              experience in implementing hands-on science in their schools.  As               follow-up to the summer work, teachers will share expertise gained din          this program in staff development sessions with colleagues in their             schools and neighboring schools.  A project newsletter will allow               participants to gain additional knowledge as they implement project             activities.  The project staff will visit school and the two school year        meetings will help ensure implementation of educationally sound teaching        of the students affected by the participating teachers.                                                                                                         An amount equivalent to 25% of the grant has been cost-shared by the            University and the participating school districts, with the latter using        some of its Title II monies to support the released time for the                teachers as they pursue the professional development components of the          grant.",
