 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of                  Pennsylvania supports a broad range of interactive and inter-                   disciplinary materials research in four primary thrust areas.                   The thrust on molecular and surface dynamics is a new effort                    involving chemists and physicists who are employing ultrafast                   laser spectroscopy to study dynamic molecular processes at                      surfaces and in condensed phases.  Design and synthesis of                      advanced polymers and ceramics brings together a group of faculty               whose principal interest is the development of new synthetic                    methods and new materials.  The thrust on non-periodic states of                matter addresses unconventional materials that exhibit quasi-                   periodicity, glass-like properties, incommensurability or other                 aspects of disorder.  The research on structure and micro-                      mechanics of interfaces aims to develop a fundamental                           understanding of the role of interfaces in determining the                      mechanical properties of materials, with increasing emphasis on                 composite materials and thin films.  In addition, a new                         initiative on ultra-thin films uses advanced surface science                    techniques to study the geometric, electronic and vibrational                   structure of atomically abrupt interfaces in ultra-thin                         materials.                                                                        The MRL also supports the development, operation and                          maintenance of major central materials research facilities, and                 provides seed funds for new faculty and high-risk research                      related to its overall program.  The program currently involves                 43 faculty members, 12 postdoctoral research associates, 12 other               technical and scientific professionals, 45 graduate students and                7 undergraduates.  The University of Pennsylvania MRL is under                  the direction of Professor Gregory C. Farrington.",
