 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to understand the cellular processes which regulate                    glyoxysome biogenesis, Dr. Harada is studying the mechanisms                    which regulate accumulation of the glyoxysome-specific enzymes,                 isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. enzyme activity appears to                be controlled at the level of mRNA accumulation, preliminary                    studies suggest that primary control occurs at the                              transcriptional level. The immediate objective is to identify the               regulatory elements and DNA binding factors which regulate the                  two genes. Regulatory elements will be identified by gene                       expression in transgenic plants.  Trans-acting factors will be                  studied by identifying and isolating DNA binding proteins and by                selecting mutation in genes encoding the factors. Characterizing                the sequence elements and factors regulating isocitrate lyase and               malate synthase genes will provide insight into the control of a                germination-related process.                                                    %%%                                                                             Glyoxysomes are specialized subcellular organelles which serve a                critical role during seed germination and seedling growth. The                  enzymes which break down stored lipids to provide nutrients for                 seedlings are stored in this organelle. Formation of glyoxysomes                is highly developmentally regulated; they are only present in                   developing seeds and in seedling and are not present in mature                  plant organs. This study will elucidate mechanisms involved in                  this regulation.",
