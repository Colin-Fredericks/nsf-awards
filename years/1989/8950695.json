 "awd_abstract_narration": "To provide an up to date, relevant education in Applied                    Optics, it is essential for students to have hands-on experience                with computer data acquisition and analysis.  This project will                 provide such an experience in the very first Applied Optics lab                 which the students will take.  A personal computer will be                      interfaced with a linear photodiode array to measure the spatial                extent of images and the image irradiance.  With this equipment,                students will be able to perform experiments in radiometry.  The                student will also be able to measure the transverse aberration of               an image.  The linear array and computer combination will make it               possible to scan an image to determine a point spread function                  and then the modulation transfer function.  This unique and                     straightforward way of determining the modulation transfer                      function of an optical system should greatly clarify this                       important subject.  This equipment will also make it possible to                modernize the classic pinhole camera.                                                                                                                                The University will match the award with an equal amount of                funds.",
