 "awd_abstract_narration": "As new patterns of industrial growth and development have emerged          since World War II, scholars have developed new theoretical frameworks          to describe and explain these patterns.  One line of inquiry has sought         to examine the ramifications of changing labor requirements of                  different industries, while other social scientists have focused on             institutional dimensions of technological innovation.  This                     collaborative project aims to synthesize these and other approaches             through detailed study of the locational decisions made by four high-           technology industrial sectors in Japan -- semiconductors, computers,            biotechnology, and software.  With the assistance of scholars in                Japan, the principal investigators will gather data on the location of          these industries and of related activities in production complexes,             which will enable them to produce maps of the geographic patterns of            high-technology industries and complexes.  These maps will provide the          bases for a second stage of research, which will consist of a set of            related inquiries into the processes and conditions that have led               Japanese high-technology firms to develop new patterns of activity.             Central to these inquiries are the conduct of structured interviews             with a carefully selected sample of corporate officials.  Data from             these interviews and from other sources will be analyzed to test                hypotheses relating industrial organization and operations with                 locational patterns and processes.                                                   This research will make significant contributions in a number of           diverse ways.  Through careful analysis of one set of industries in             Japan, the relative contributions of each of the major current                  theoretical perspectives can be assessed and possibly reconciled.  The          research also will provide valuable empirical data and interpretations          of value for those studying contemporary industrial geography in any            setting, and especially for those seeking more complete understandings          of the distinctive character of modern Japanese economic organization.",
