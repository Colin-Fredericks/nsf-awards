 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of her thesis advisor, Dr. Patricia L.                    Crown, Ms. Maria N. Zedeno will analyze 310 whole andrestored                   archaeological vessels for her doctoral dissertation research.                  These materials, recovered from Chodistaas Pueblo, located in                   east central Arizona, provide an excellent data base since all                  were recovered in secure archaeological context from a site which               was occupied for less than fifty years.  With assistance from                   scientists at the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian                     Institution, Ms. Zedeno will determine clay sources through trace               element analysis of ceramics and comparison with known clay                     sources in the region.  Through petrographic and other analyses,                she will reconstruct the techniques by which the pottery was                    constructed, and she will also conduct a stylistic analysis of                  design styles.  Comparisons will then be made among different                   sets of data.                                                                                                                                                   To reconstruct trade and other interaction networks,                            archaeologists often analyze ceramics at archaeological sites in                an attempt to determine which types were made locally and which                 were imported from elsewhere.  Such studies are often based on                  either examination of design or techniques of manufacture and                   include unfounded assumptions about how these variables relate to               point of origin.  Ms. Zedeno will evaluate such assumptions                     through analysis of the chronologically limited,                                stratigraphically secure Chodistaas Pueblo sample.  Trace element               data should provide a basis against which stylistic and                         technological variables can be measured.                                                                                                                        This research is important not only for what it will reveal about               cultural interaction in the U.S. Southwest but also for its                     broader methodological significance.  It will be of interest to a               wide range of archaeologists.",
