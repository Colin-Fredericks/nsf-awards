 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purchase of a 60 MHz NMR allowed the implementation of the                  development plan which introduces the routine use of NMR spectroscopy           over a broad combination; of courses.  The development plan has two             objectives.  First, the instrument gives students a practical                   familiarity of NMR in its traditional analytical applications.  Second,         the instrument is used to teach fundamental concepts of spectroscopy,           strucutre determination, thermodynamics, kinetics, structural                   isomerism, magnetic properties and exchange mechanisms in experiments           where NMR spectroscopy provides the best means of obtaining                     experimental data.  These objectives are implemented by a program of            experiments introduced into courses of organic chemistry, physical              chemistry, chemical instrumentation, advanced organic chemistry and             advanced inorganic chemistry as well as use in undergraduate research           projects.  The project is designed to provide students with a solid             understanding of NMR theory and practice, while providing improved              ability to investigate many important chemical phenomena.  The                  institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
