 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. Keith E. Gubbins and colleagues at Cornell         University to collaborate with Prof. K. Nakanishi and co-workers at             Kyoto University, Japan, over a period of two years.  They will                 continue a cooperative research program which has advanced the use of           computer simulation techniques to investigate the thermodynamic                 properties of fluids and mixtures of fluids, as well as their                   structural properties at the molecular level.  The techniques to be             used involve statistical (Monte Carlo) and more classical analytical            computer solutions of the equations of molecular dynamics.                                                                                                      The purpose of this research is to make possible the reliable                   prediction of the physical properties of fluid mixtures, such as                those involving natural gas and petroleum, that are used in industrial          and other chemical processes.  The fluids studied here will be those            which associate strongly, such as alcohol and water.  The phase                 equilibria of such mixtures are so complex that no satisfactory                 theory for them has been available.  Computer simulations will be               performed to study the thermodynamic, phase equilibrium, and dynamical          properties of the bulk phases of these aqueous solutions, and the               work will then progress to a study of the adsorption of associating             molecules at phase interfaces.  This research may lead to significant           improvements in production, processing, and separation methods.",
