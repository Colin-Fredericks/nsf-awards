 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is studying the role of pyrophosphate as an                       alternative (to ATP) energy source and phosphate donor in                       higher plants.  Research is concentrating on measurements of                    the pyrophosphate content of plant tissues and the variations                   that occur between tissues that serve as sources and sinks                      for carbohydrate metabolism.  The pyrophosphate-utilizing                       enzyme, pyrophosphatase, will be purified and used to                           generate antibodies against the protein for use in cellular                     localization studies.  The role of pyrophosphate in ethylene                    production is to be ascertained by correlating pyrophosphate                    measurements with the production of ethylene during the                         climacteric response in ripening banana.%%%                                                                                                                     The regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in higher plants is                   integral to the processes by which plants grow and develop.                     This research is looking at the role of a specific high                         energy compound, pyrophosphate, as both an energy source and                    regulatory molecule in higher plants.  Studies will focus on                    attempts to purify a major enzyme associated with                               pyrophosphate metabolism and ultimately determine its                           cellular site of action.  In addition work is being carried                     out on the contributions of pyrophosphate in the fruit                          ripening response in banana.***//",
