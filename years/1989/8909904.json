Pratt of Wesleyan University and Dr. Jubrail F. Rahil, Dean, Faculty            of Science, Bethlehem University.  The proposed research is to study            the chemistry of the interactions of betalactam antibiotics with two            groups of bacterial enzymes.  There appears good reason to believe              the two groups are evolutionarily related.  A portion of the research           will be to determine those similarities.  The goal of this project is           to explore the ability of class A betalactamse to catalyse the common           reactions of the two enzymes.  The knowledge gained in this research            will be compared with other classes of betalatamse in their reactions           to betalactam antibiotics.                                                                                                                                      Scope:  This proposal will bring a recently U.S. trained (1982) PhD.,           who is now a Dean of Faculty of Science of a Middle East university,            to participate in nearly a year of important research in the                    laboratory of a well regarded U.S. bio-organic chemist.  The research           will broaden Dr. Rahil's experience in enzymology in a more medicinal           and pharmaceutical direction.  His work in this project should                  bolster his own research upon his return to Bethlehem University as             well as increase his value as teacher and his capabilities in                   performing community service in his homeland.  This proposal does               meet the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program of           advancing the international exchange of scientific knowledge and does           contribute to the enhancement of science in a developing country.",
