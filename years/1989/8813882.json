 "awd_abstract_narration": "This symposium/workshop conference brings together investigators                studying various aspects of spinal cord development and                         reorganization in vertebrates.  The major focus of workshop                     is on normal development, but attempts will be made to relate                   normal development to events following spinal cord injury in both               adult and developing animals.  In recent years significant                      progress has been made in our understanding of spinal cord                      neurons and differentiation, pathway formation, synaptogenesis                  and the ontogeny of spinal cord neurons and glia have all been                  the subjects of recent investigation.  By assembling a group of                 investigators who work on different problems in different species               and who use a variety of classical and modern biological                        approaches, we hope to further our understanding of normal                      development and to identify directions for future research that                 may lead to recovery of function following spinal cord injury in                humans.",
