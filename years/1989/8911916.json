 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by C. Foote and R. Lehrer of UCLA is within the                    Chemistry of Life Processes Program, jointly supported by                       Organic Dynamics of the Chemistry Division and Cell Biology of                  the Division of Cellular Biosciences.  This work deals with the                 role of white blood cells in the defense against infection.                     Efforts will be made to learn the details about how oxygen is                   utilized during this process.                                                                                                                                   The active chlorinating species and other strong oxidants in                    the antimicrobial action of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes                  (PMNs), eosinophils and macrophages will be characterized by                    chemical means.  A quantitative trimethoxybenzene assay will be                 used for the production of hypochlorous acid, and systems will                  be designed to trap other possible oxidizing species in defined                 locations in both the interior and exterior of these cells.                     Reactions of HOCl and other chlorinating agents will be studied                 to obtain chemical fingerprints for various positive chlorine                   species \"in vitro\" and in cells.  Although it is likely that                    HOCl or a similar species is the major oxygen-dependent                         antimicrobial species of the neutrophil (HOBR in the                            eosinophil), an unresolved problem is the mechanism by which                    macrophages (which lack the MPO of PMNs) and MPO-deficient PMNs                 kill organisms.  This mechanism might involve singlet oxygen,                   other active oxygen species, or something else.  Singlet oxygen                 detection methodology will be further refined, and technology                   will be developed for the detection of other reactive species                   to attack this problem.  Attempts to detect singlet oxygen                      quantitatively in eosinophils and further improvements on the                   halogen assay will be made.  Chemical probes for singlet                        oxygen, halogens, and other species which are covalently bonded                 to readily-phagocyzed polymer microbeads should provide useful,                 localizable probes for the white-cell phagocytic vacuole.  This                 should allow an answer to the question of whether all the                       oxidant is produced within the phagocytic vesicle or whether                    some escapes to the media.",
