 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of freezing and environmental cooling is being                    impacted by the problem of stratospheric ozone depletion as a                   result of reliance on fluorocarbons as the principal refrigerant.               In addition increases in the cost of energy require improvements                in the components (heat exchangers, compressors) used in the                    air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment if US industry is to               remain competitive in this area.  This award is for funding an                  Industry/University Planning meeting to study the feasibility and               viability of an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center                 on Advanced Air-conditioning and Refrigeration Technology to be                 operated by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  A                      prospectus for the Center's research and operations has been                    prepared which will provide a basis for discussion and comment at               the planning meeting to be held in April 1989 at Urbana,                        Illinois.                                                                            The principal investigator and his colleagues are recognized               authorities in their fields and have the necessary industrial                   interactions to run this meeting.                                                    This project has been coordinated with Dr. William                         Grosshandler, PD for Thermal Systems Engineering in the CBTE                    Division.                                                                            This Program Manager recommends that the University of                     Illinois be awarded a grant of $13,987 for one year for an                      Industry Planning meeting for an I/UCR Center on Advanced Air                   Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology.  Future funding will                 be based on a new proposal.",
