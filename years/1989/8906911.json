 "awd_abstract_narration": "An essential process in many industrial systems is the transfer of heat         from a surface to a flowing fluid stream with a minimum dissipation             cost.  As a result of the critical role that efficient heat transport           plays in applications, several heat transfer enhancement techniques have        been devised in the past.  A common form of transport enhancement is            flow destabilization via cylindrical eddy-promoters placed inside a             channel.  Previous studies suggest that appropriate destabilization of          the flow in the laminar regime results in increasing transport rates up         to 500 percent.  In this work, the transitional and turbulent flow              regime, mostly encountered in engineering practice, will be studied.            Destabilization should be applied at the naturally stable scales of             motion, i.e. excitation of the -near-the-wall viscous sublayer.  The            work will include both Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), as well as            companion detailed experiments.  The numerical simulations are based on         spectral element methods that combine high-accuracy, as well as                 flexibility in handling complex geometries.  The experiments are chosen         to allow a maximum overlay with the numerical data in measuring time            lines and fluid particle paths of velocity and temperature fields.              Experimental techniques include flow visualization via hydrogen bubble,         schlieren photography, and laser-sheet scanning techniques.                                                                                                     The research will have a direct impact on the development of                    innovative heat exchanger systems.  At the same time, it will underline         the potential of DNS as a very powerful tool in gaining deep                    understanding and obtaining detailed results for transport processes.           The companion experiments will provide a basis for the validation of the        computations.",
