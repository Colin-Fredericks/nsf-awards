 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to develop and expand the application           of nonlinear optics to image processing, optical computing, and beam            control, using both theoretical and an experimental approach.  In               traditional nonlinear optics studies, a small number of beams are               caused to couple to each other, or a single beam is self-modified, by           the nonlinear dependence of the electric polarization density on the            optical electric field.  It has been found more recently that certain           of these effects can couple very large numbers of beams or beam                 components, and can thereby perform such tasks as image correlation,            image phase-conjugation, and image-frequency conversion in \"real                time:, i.e., on nanosecond or even picosecond time scales.  The                 investigators have already introduced phase-conjugation of complex              optical images by four-wave mixing, and especially photorefractive              materials to enable phase-conjugation at low (milliwatt) power levels.          In this work they propose to pursue experimental and theoretical                studies in three areas growing out of the previous and ongoing                  research.  These are: (1) Understanding and characterization of                 nonlinear optical materials, (2) Development of new nonlinear                   materials, and (3) Development of nonlinear image processing devices,           algorithms, and architectures.",
