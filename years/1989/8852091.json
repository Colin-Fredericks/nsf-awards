 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the anthropology department of                     Clevland State University (CSU) to purchase a representative set                of key hominoid fossil primate teaching casts.  The casts                       requested will be used to institute formal laboratory sections                  that will accompany an upper level undergraduate course in human                paleontology.  The casts will also be used for introductory                     courses, and human osteology courses.  Students in the human                    paleontology course will be required to carry out a series of                   exercises that illustrate the quantitative and qualitative                      techniques which are used in analyses of (a) phylogenetic                       reconstruction, (b) identification of evolutionary trait                        complexes, (c) allometric size and scaling, and (d) functional                  morphology,  In addition, students will be required to maintain a               computer data base for weekly lab reports and their evaluations                 of various analytic techniques.                                                                                                                                 The funds will (a) permit expansion of CSU undergraduate course                 offerings in physical anthropology, (b) provide anthropology                    majors, minors, and non-majors with an opportunity to directly                  confront fossil evidence of human evolution, (c) provide students               with an opportunity to conduct, or initiate, analyses that                      directly involve fossil discoveries that have played a pivotal                  role in the development of human origins theories, and (d)                      encourage interest in graduate studies directed toward improving                our understanding of human morphological and behavioral                         adaptations.  The grantee institution is matching this NSF award                with funds from non-Federal sources.",
