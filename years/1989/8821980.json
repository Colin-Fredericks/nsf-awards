 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation has supported the annual                        Cliometrics Conferences as well as the First World Congress of                  Cliometrics in recent years.  The meetings continue to serve as                 an important means for encouraging research in economic history                 and as a forum for disseminating new methods and findings among                 historians as well as economists at home and abroad.  The Second                World Congress will bring together 75-100 scholars from around                  the world to discuss and compare both basic cliometric tools and                their current research results.                                                                                                                                 This proposal asks support for some administrative costs and                    partial travel of some, but not all,  United States participants                at the Second World Congress of Cliometrics,  to be held in                     Madrid,  Spain,  in June 1989.",
