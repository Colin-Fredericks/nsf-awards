 "awd_abstract_narration": "We now know that declarative memory, the type of memory we use to               remember facts, faces and events, is intimately associated with                 the brain's limbic system (including such structures as the                     hippocampus, the amygdala and the hypothalamus).  Procedural                    memory is of a very different form, and is the type of memory we                use to learn and perform basic and complex motor skills which                   help us to interact with our environment.  This latter type of                  memory is now attributed, in part, to a very different part of                  the brain--the cerebellum.                                                                                                                                      During the past several years Dr. Lavond and his colleagues have                been involved in an extensive mapping of the cerebellum as                      pertains to its involvement in the acquisition of a classically                 (Pavlovian) conditioned response.  The earlier studies involved                 making destructive lesions in selected brain nuclei, their inputs               or outputs, and demonstrating that this destroys old memories and               prevents the formation of new memories.  A major drawback to this               technique is that it is permanent:  There is no way to restore                  destroyed brain tissue, and more importantly, it is impossible to               distinguish between different loci which are involved in the                    learning versus the memorial process.                                                                                                                           Dr. Lavond is now utilizing a remarkable new technique which                    allows him to make \"reversible lesions\" of selected brain loci.                 He uses a miniaturized cooling probe to drop the temperature of                 precise brain regions:  This renders the nerve cells temporarily                inactive.  Then, as the brain warms up, the functioning of that                 previously cooled part of the brain returns to normal.                                                                                                          In one experiment, the acquisition of memory (learning) is being                tested.  Cooling the brain locus necessary for learning will                    prevent the brain activity essential for memory.  When returned                 to normal temperature, there should be no recall or performance                 associated with having been trained.  In another experiment,                    memory retention per se is being tested.  If, in a previously                   trained animal, the memory locus itself is anesthetized then                    there will be no performance of learned activity.  When returned                to normal temperature, the performance will reappear.                                                                                                           Results of these studies will help localize further the different               brain loci involved in different aspects of learning and memory.                This information will be useful in the design of yet more                       pragmatic therapeutic regimens for children with learning                       disabilities, those who have sustained traumatic brain injury,                  and for aged adults with senile dementia.",
