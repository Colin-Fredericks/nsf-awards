 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards provides funds to an outstanding group of biochemists          for the purchase and operation of instruments including a modern high           field NMR spectrometer, an EPR spectrometer, related computing                  equipment, and equipment for synthesis and purification of peptides and         other molecules.  The group will use the equipment for a variety of             studies aimed at elucidating the structures in solution of small DNAs           and of certain proteins and antibiotics, the structure and dynamics of          larger DNAs in solution, and metabolic pathways in some bacteria and            fungi.                                                                              The development and application of biophysical techniques, in               particular that of EPR and 2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, to studies           of structure and behavior of macromolecules like DNA and protein is             currently one of the most exiting areas of biological research.                 Although NMR instruments have been available for many years, it is only         within the last few years that high field instruments with the                  requisite resolution and sensitivity for such studies have been                 developed.  The Seattle group, which includes both junior and senior            faculty of international reputation, has been at the forefront of these         developments; ;they will continue to play an important role in                  application of these instruments to problems of great biological                interest.",
