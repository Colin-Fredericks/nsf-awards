 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Climate Research Institute seeks to inform public policy officials          and opinion leaders of the gravity of the climate change challenge.             Scientists have predicted a global warming of as much as 9 degrees F.           by the middle of the 21st Century.  Increased vulnerability of coastal          areas to storm damage, and significant changes in agriculture                   production, forestry, and fisheries have been predicted.                                                                                                        The Second North American Conference, to be held December 6-7, 1988 in          Washington, D.C., will bring together top scientists studying climate           change and its likely impacts; and government policy makers,                    environmental leaders, and corporate decision makers.                                                                                                           NSF is one of several government and non-government sponsors of this            conference.  Because significant climate change may be observed first           in the Polar regions, this proposal is important to the Division of             Polar Programs.  Research on climate change in the Polar regions is             also a major concern to the U.S. Arctic Research Plan.",
