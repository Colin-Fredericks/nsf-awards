 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) is emgerging as an                     important analytical technique for the separation of organic                    compounds with molecular weights as high as about 1000 amu, 600                 amu above the present capability of conventional gas                            chromatography (GC).  An SFC instrument will allow a variety of                 new experiements to be performed in teaching laboratories.                      Experiments which are planned include the analysis of polymeric                 reaction products in Organic Chemsitry Laboratory, analysis of                  long chain fatty acids in Quantitative Analysis, and the                        comparison of SFC with High Pressure Liquid Chromatography                      (HPLC) and GC for the analysis of polar molecules in                            Instrumental Analysis.  SFC will also be used in the honors                     section of general chemistry, and in undergraduate introduction                 to research.   In addition, the acquisition of an SFC will                      provide students the opportunity to learn about the properties                  and uses of critical fluids.                                                                                                                                    This ILI award, jointly supported by the Chemistry Shared                       Instrumentation Program and the USEME Division of SEE, will                     help the Department of Chemistry at Tennessee Technological                     University to acquire an SFC apparatus that will enhance the                    udergraduate laboratory instruction in this RUI Department.",
