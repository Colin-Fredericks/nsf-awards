 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectroscopy is essential to chemists and biologists who are                    carrying out frontier research.                                                                                                                                 The Department of Chemistry at the University of Akron will use                 this award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    and the Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program to                   help acquire a high-field NMR spectrometer.  The areas of                       research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include:                                                                                                      1) Mechanisms of enzymatic reactions                                            2) Transition metal catalysis of polymerization reactions                       3) Development and study of the chemistry of iodinane reagents                  4) New 2D-NMR techniques for studying weak intermolecular                          interactions                                                                 5) Enzymatic catalysts for carrying out synthetic                                  transformations                                                              6) Solution structures and conformations of enzyme active sites.",
