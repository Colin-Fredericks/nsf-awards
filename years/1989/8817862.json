 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manner in which legislators gain office has implications for                democratic theory.  Modern political science equates representation             with policy responsiveness.  But if service responsiveness looms                largely in the contemporary representative-constituent relationship,            perhaps much of what legislators do and constituents want is not                representation.  Coherent national policy can be difficult to achieve           when individual legislators have little incentive to subordinate                service responsiveness to a larger end.  The problem, from the                  standpoint of assigning political responsibility, is the reduced                ability to produce coherent policy decisions.  By accident or intent,           representational trade-offs exist.  If responsiveness to the individual         needs of the ordinary citizen waxes, party responsiveness, as well as           the representation of the collectivity wanes.                                                                                                                   Studies concerning the ways in which legislators sustain or increase            their constituent support have often contradicted one another and have          resulted in differing conclusions.  The major limitation of this                literature is that most, if not all, of the data on perquisites are             highly aggregated, and district level data are often unavailable..                                                                                              In this investigation the researcher addresses these problems, and              takes advantage of access to data on actual constituent-member contacts         to observe and record two groups of respondents, one that had candidate         contact and one that has not.  Data are from 1,100 telephone interviews         in a selected legislative district.  The study probes the impact of             legislative perquisites on constituent evaluations (i.e., incumbent             reputation and constituent trust) as well as voting decisions.  It              focuses on a particular perquisite, ombudsmen service as the provision          of assistance to individuals to resolve a problem with a federal                agency.                                                                                                                                                         Using simulatneous equation modeling, hypotheses tested will reveal how         legislators' use of perquisites to encourage and perform casework               affect constituent evaluations and voting decisions.  Results will              illuminate how constituents respond to incumbent behavior.  The                 resulting effects on contemporary representative-constituent                    relationships and the \"repsonsible parties\" model of government will            also be addressed.",
