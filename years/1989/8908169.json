 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this project is to uncover the fine                    structural changes and behavior of living cells which lead to the               emergence of structural organization and morphogenesis in                       embryonic development.  As part of this effort, new non-                        destructive methods of light microscopy are devised and applied                 to analyze the dynamic changes of fine structure, directly in                   living cells.                                                                                                                                                   In the upcoming granting period, it is anticipated that the                     development of a video microscope system for four-dimensional                   analysis of early developmental events in transparent intact                    living cells and embryos will be completed.  The proposed system                will provide a practical means for dynamically retrieving                       stereoscopically paired or other three-dimensional, high-                       resolution images synthesized from a through-focal series of thin               optical sections or tomograms recorded at time-lapsed intervals.                As the system is completed, it will be tested and its performance               optimized by examining the four-dimensional organization of                     microtubules involved in the asymmetric positioning of cell                     centers, as well as the behavior of primary mesenchyme cells                    participating in spicule morphogenesis in echinoderm gastrula and               plutei.                                                                                                                                                         It is anticipated that his research will lead to the development                of a four-dimensional imaging system which will revolutionize the               ability of cell biologists to study living cells.",
