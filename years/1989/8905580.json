 "awd_abstract_narration": "Telomeres are the specialized structures that form the                          termini of eukaryotic chromosomes.  These structures are                        essential for the replication and maintenance of the genome.                    Telomeres have been extensively studied in lower eukaryotes                     but considerably less in known about higher eukaryotic                          telomeres.  A higher eukaryotic telomere has recently been                      cloned from the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana,                           providing the opportunity to study the telomeric regions of                     this organism as a model system.  Two aspects of telomere                       structure and function will be studied.  First, the nature                      and organization of the DNA sequences that lie adjacent to A.                   thaliana telomeres will be investigated.  Second, the                           mechanism by which a broken chromosome end acquires a new                       telomere (i.e., telomere healing) will be studied using a                       chromosomal mutant of A. thaliana which carries a healed                        telomere.  The healed telomere will be isolated and its                         structure compared to that of the original chromosomal site                     to determine how the healing event took place.  In addition,                    the healed telomere, which resided proximal to a centromere,                    will be investigated as a potential tool for studying A.                        thaliana centromere structure.                                                                                                                                  Characterization of essential structural components of                          chromosomes gives greater insight into a basic understanding                    of mechanisms used by cells to maintain the correct                             chromosome complement.  Additionally, this information could                    be useful in engineering artificial chromosomes for plants, a                   technique which would add significantly to the already                          powerful repertoire of available molecular techniques.",
