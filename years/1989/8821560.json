 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been shown that interactions exist between sequential                    enzymes of the Krebs tricarboxylic acid cycle and that these                    enzymes also bind to proteins in the inner mitochondrial                        membrane.  There still remain, however, several Krebs                           tricarboxylic acid cycle interactions that are not                              demonstrated and several which need to be better                                characterized.  It is possible that these supramolecular                        complexes have not only a metabolic role but also a                             structural role in the mitochondria.  An unresolved problem                     concerning mitochondrial structure is the molecular basis for                   the form of cristae, which show great variability within the                    same mitochondrion.  This project will:  1) isolate and                         characterize the binding proteins for the inner membrane; and                   2) investigate the molecular basis of cristae form.                                                                                                             Cells are not simply \"bags\" of enzymes.  Organization of the                    elements of cells, as well as cells themselves, allows                          efficient and economical use of the components of life.  At                     the molecular level, an organized array of the enzymes of a                     metabolic sequence allows the attainment of higher fluxes                       with lower concentrations of each of the intermediates.  A                      second benefit is that such organization does not tax the                       limited solvent capacity of cells.  There seems to have been                    some evolutionary pressure for organization since some                          metabolic pathways exist as separate enzymes in organisms                       believed to represent early evolutionary conditions and exist                   as multifunctional enzymes in cells which are believed to                       have arisen later in evolution.  This project will provide                      information in the role of multi-enzyme complexes in the                        formation of cell membranes.***//",
