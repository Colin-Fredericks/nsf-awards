 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Electron Impact Cross Sections for Modelling                  Radiation Damage:  The Water Molecule\" between Dr. Russell Bonham of            the University of Indiana at Bloomington and Ren-guang WANG of                  Chengdu University of Science and Technology is jointly sponsored by            NSF and the Chinese State Educational Commission (SEDC).                                                                                                        The investigators propose to carry out a series of measurements of              the absolute cross sections for electron electron impact of cross               sections of the water molecule.  In addition to determining collision           cross sections, the researchers propose to identify dissociation                products, and determine lifetimes of dissociation products, especially          OH radicals.  If successful, this research would generate an improved           cross section database for such reactions, which is essential for               modeling radiation damage in solids and biological materials,  as               well as in the design of high voltage and current switching devices             for use in fusion reactors, for understanding stellar and planetary             atmospheres, and for modeling low temperature plasmas used in the               industrial production of computer chips.",
