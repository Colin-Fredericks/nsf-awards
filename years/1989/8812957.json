 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the nature of the transient forces in                 roller chain drives.  Chain drive mechanisms have been in use since             the 1800's, but despite their age and widespread use, chain drives              remain poorly understood.  The popularity of the mechanism is                   expected to increase due to its low cost and simplicity.  The auto              industry is currently investigating the possibility of using the                chain drive as the primary drive mechanism for certain types of                 future passenger cars.  The project comprises an experimental and               analytical component.  The experimental component has three phases              and will investigate the impact force between a roller element on the           chain and the sprocket as the roller is seated onto the sprocket, the           forces that exist in the chain during all operating conditions, and             the forces on the sprocket teeth during operating conditions.                   Earlier research efforts focused on the construction of the chain               drive test machine to be used in the experimental activity.  Impact             force measurements are obtained by instrumenting a sprocket with                strain gauges, obtaining strain gauge measurements for a variety of             chain speeds and sprocket sizes and chain tensions, and converting              the measurements into force data.  These data will be instrumental in           determining the effect of impact forces in the galling and pitting of           roller elements.  The second experimental phase, measurement of the             forces in the chain is accomplished by instrumenting the plates of              the chain with strain gauges.  The force time history                           information is useful for design purposes.  The third                           experimental phase, measurement of sprocket tooth loads, is                     accomplished by the use of proximity sensors.  All experimental                 evidence will be used to develop mathematical models to predict                 the dynamic behavior of chain drives.",
