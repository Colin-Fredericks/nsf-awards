The small                      minority representation in marine science, led a group of                       Directors of Marine Laboratories in the southeastern U.S. to                    approach their colleagues at Historically Minority Colleges and                 Universities (HMCUs) to see what could be done to increase                      minority student interest in marine science careers.  To this                   end, a program will be initiated at the University of Maryland,                 Eastern Shore, an HMCU, to involve students in marine science                   early in their college career. The intent of the program is to                  provide support, by way of stipends, and to nurture and expand                  the student's interest in marine science through course work                    during the academic year and full time laboratory research                      experiences during the summer.//",
