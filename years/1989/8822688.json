 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study will be made of various types of phenomenon in superfluid               3helium which involve violent departures from equilibrium and/or                strongly nonlinear dissipation.  Examples of such problems are                  the way in which textures and bulk magnetization follow the                     moving A-B interface, dissipation by moving singular vortices,                  the Josephson effect in both mass and spin supercurrent flow, and               the dynamics of a wire vibrating in superfluid 3helium-B at very                low tempertures.  A conscious attempt will be made to develop                   intermediate-level, phenomenological concepts for this type of                  problem, rather than relying on existing microscopic technology.                Also an attempt will be made to develop into a quantitative                     theory a collective scenario for the thermal and acoustic                       properties of glasses.  The scenario is based on the idea that                  the underlying principle of the striking universality in glassy                 properties is to be sought in the phonon-mediated interactions of               the stress variables of large subvolumes.  It is hoped that such                a model will replace the currently established \"tunnelling two-                 level system\" model at low tempertures, and in addition explain                 much of the intermediate- and high-temperature behavior, such as                the plateau in the thermal conductivity, which is believed to                   correspond to the point at which the retarded nature of the                     phonon-induced interaction begins to play a substantial role.",
