 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the influence of the physico-                    chemistry and microstructure of clays on their mechanical                       properties.                                                                                                                                                     Previous work indicates that the impact of depositional                         environment and post depositional environmental conditions and                  stresses may have significant influence on engineering properties               and mechanical behavior of clay systems.  Among the parameters                  and properties that will be investigated are index properties,                  stiffness, compressibility, shear strength and permeability.                    Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques                   will be utilized to assess the effect of mineralogy, and                        microstructure on such parameters and behavior.  Artificially                   prepared samples of clay premixed or permeated with various                     contaminating compounds will be subjected to a number of                        laboratory tests, microstructure and mineralogy analyses as                     indicated above.  The samples will be prepared both by                          consolidating from slurry and sedimenting in a large scale                      sedimentation tank.                                                                                                                                             The outcome of the research is anticipated to further the                       understanding of the complex interrelationships between micro and               macro properties of clay systems and help researchers and                       practitioners to better predict long-term behavior of such                      systems under threat of rapidly changing environmental                          conditions.",
