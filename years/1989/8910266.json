 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop in detail and                      demonstrate an improved method for automatically identifying the                concepts present in a natural language text, which goes beyond                  categorization and is able to identify relevant relationships and               propositions.  Robust methods for text analysis based on pattern                matching have shown some success in topic categorization, and                   have been applied to recognition of concepts as well, with mixed                results.  In contrast, systems that analyze text at deeper levels               have very limited ability to deal with text that cannot be                      completely parsed and interpreted.  In this project, a method is                pursued for achieving greater accuracy and depth of conceptual                  analysis without sacrificing robustness.  The basic idea of the                 method is to analyze the text syntactically producing a chart                   structure, and then apply pattern matching to the arcs of the                   chart rather than to the raw text.  If successful this method                   will represent a major innovation in practical processing of                    natural language.  It will lead to more powerful and precise                    methods for document classification.  It will also provide a                    critical (and so far absent) component of systems for intelligent               information retrieval.",
