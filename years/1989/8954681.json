 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at perfecting and testing a new instructional             method to improve the effectiveness of introductory physics teaching.           the methods has two chief characteristics:  1) a systematic challenge to        common sense misconceptions about the physical world, and 2) an emphasis        on models and modeling as basic to physical understanding.                                                                                                      Two versions of the method will be tested.  The first version is                designed especially for high school physics.  It emphasizes student             development of explicit models to interpret laboratory activities.              After an initial test, this version will be taught to high school               physics teachers in a summer Teacher Enhancement Workshop, and its              effect on their subsequent teaching will be evaluated.  Teachers with           weak as well as strong backgrounds will be included.  A special effort          will be made to include females and minorities.                                                                                                                 The second version will be tested in a special college physics course           designed to prepare students with weak backgrounds for a standard               calculus based physics course.  It emphasizes modeling techniques in            problem solving.                                                                                                                                                This project is jointly supported by the Division of Materials                  development, Research and Informal Science Education and the Division of        Teacher Preparation and Enhancement.",
