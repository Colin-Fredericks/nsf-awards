 "awd_abstract_narration": "To complete her doctoral dissertation research Ms. Rani                         Alexander, under the direction of Dr. Robert Santley, will                      conduct archaeological and ethnohistoric research in the region                 of Yaxuna, Yucatan, Mexico.  She will focus on the seventeenth                  and eighteenth centuries A.D., the period during which the local                rural economy of this region became increasingly incorporated                   into the broader Spanish colonial economy.  Through examination                 of abundant documentary resources she will be able to trace this                process in some detail.  Excavation of several sites will allow                 on-the-ground reconstruction of patterns of consumption,                        settlement and houselot organization.  Comparison of these two                  bodies of data will then permit elucidation of the material                     correlates of economic change.                                                                                                                                  While archaeologists who study the development of complex                       societies have long been interested in the mechanisms through                   which such entities expand, their focus has been on core or                     central areas to the detriment of outlying regions.  In fact                    methodologies to determine how such areas were economically                     changed have not been developed.  Robust techniques do not exist                to ask such questions of archaeological data.  Because                          documentary evidence in the Yaxuna region is excellent and recent               development has not obscured most archaeological sites, this part               of Yucatan provides an excellent controlled context to conduct                  such research.                                                                                                                                                  This research is important not only for the light it will shed on               Mexican history but also for the analytic techniques which will                 be developed.  These should be useful to archaeologists in many                 parts of the world.  Because Ms. Alexander will employ and help                 train a Mexican field assistant, she will make a direct                         contribution to developing the archaeological infrastructure in                 Mexico.",
