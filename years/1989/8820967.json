 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research                           project between Sava Milosevic, University of Belgrade, and                     Eugene Stanley, Boston University, the investigators will                       continue their theoretical work on the physics of novel                         materials and processes.  Certain behavioral aspects of                         materials, in particular polymers, will be studied:  (1)                        crossover from fractal lattice to Euclidean lattice; (2)                        lipid aggregation in model biomembranes; (3) conduction in                      disordered materials; and (4) fluid mechanics of dentritic                      solidification.  The research will advance understanding of                     the physical laws governing the morphology, microstructure                      and processes of novel materials.                                                                                                                               This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board                      on Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported                       through a joint fund consisting of matching contributions                       from the governments of the United States and Yugoslavia.                       The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department                    of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to                       the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but                         include dollar funds for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia                    and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
