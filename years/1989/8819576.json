High particulate fluxes occur on the Amazon shelf as a result of                the enormous sediment discharge from the Amazon River and the                   extensive resuspension of fine-grained shelf sediment by tidal                  processes.  This component examines several chemical processes                  occurring at the Amazon River/ocean boundary which are affected                 by particle fluxes.  The specific topics of research describe:                                                                                                       (1) the release of uranium and radium from the particulate                          phase to the dissolved phase during river/ocean mixing:                                                                                                     (2) scavenging of particle-reactive elements from                                   continental shelf waters; and                                                                                                                               (3) evaluating the effects of suspended sediment                                    concentration on the biological uptake and regeneration                         of carbon and silicon.                                                                                                                                 This research is part of the AmasSeds Project (A Multi-                         disciplinary Amazon Shelf Sediment Study), which seeks to                       understand the physical, chemical and geological proceses that                  affect, or are affected by, particle fluxes on the Amazon shelf.                High fluxes occur on the Amazon shelf as a result of the enormous               sediment discharge from the Amazon River and the mixing of fine-                grained sediment with river water by the tides.  This component                 of the overall project examines several chemical processes                      occurring at the Amazon River/ocean boundary which are affected                 by particle fluxes.  An understanding of these processes will                   help investigators to interpret observations from other                         river/ocean systems throughout the world.",
