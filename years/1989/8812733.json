 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the discovery of the spectacular hydrothermal vent                    ecosystems a decade ago, researchers have been investigating the                actual mechanisms by which these productive systems are nourished               and maintained.  Chemosynthetic production is hypothesized to be                the overwhelmingly dominant for of organic energy supporting the                marine life at vents, with photosynthetically produced sources                  being minor.  This idea needs some rigorous testing, however.                   This investigation by Dr. Grassle and co-workers will address                   first the basic question of whether chemosynthetically derived                  carbon can be traced in the surrounding non-vent benthic fauna                  using stable isotope techniques.  If stable isotopes can be                     applied in this system these researchers will try to discern how                the contribution varies with distance from the vents, and how the               community structure of the soft-sediment benthic fauna, in terms                of species composition and abundance, size distribution,                        reproductive state and proportion of juveniles of common species,               tracks the contribution of chemosynthetic carbon.",
