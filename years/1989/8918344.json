 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to increase our knowledge about the causes and                    consequences of global environmental change, social scientists from             around the world must work together to shed light on how humans affect          and respond to natural processes of change.  Many new insights will             result from independent research projects, but coordinated assessment           of extant research and identification of research needs is also needed          in order to facilitate collaborative research and more effective work           by independent scholars.  This project will enable the International            Social Science Council (ISSC) to develop an action plan for research on         the human dimensions of global environmental change for consideration           and adoption at the ISSC general assembly late in 1990.  In                     establishing this action plan, ISSC leaders and staff members will              review the current state of knowledge with respect to human impacts on          and responses to global environmental change, paying special attention          to social dimensions of resource use, perception and assessment of              environmental change, and the effects of institutional mechanisms on            the global environment.  A few broad-scale activities that should               advance multi-disciplinary understanding of these problems will be              identified, as will be a larger number of specific research projects            that can be conducted in parallel with one another or cooperatively on          an international basis.  NSF support of this project will be                    complemented by grants from funding organizations in other nations.                  Development of an action plan for research by ISSC and its fifteen         member unions should provide a substantial stimulus for collaborative           research by social scientists throughout the world.  Because of the             global scale of the problem, an international approach to identifying           and understanding the ways in which human and natural systems interact          is essential.  Because this project is undertaken by scholars from many         countries, the ISSC research plan is most likely to be one from which           international collaboration will result.  This project therefore should         speed the process of understanding the myriad ways in which humans              interact with the natural environment during these times of rapid               change.",
