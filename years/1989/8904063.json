 "awd_abstract_narration": "The southern Sierra Nevada offers an oblique section through               young batholith-generated sialic crust from surface (volcanic)                  levels to deep (granulitic) levels.  Regional mapping and Pb/U                  zircon geochronology reveal structural continuity through this                  crustal section for igneous-metamorphic assemblages of ~100 Ma,                 making it one of the youngest exposed continental crustal                       sections in the world.  Compositional and structural patterns                   observed in this section in conjunction with geophysical and                    volcanic xenolith data pose important problems on sialic crustal                genesis and the nature of lower continental crust.   Some                       specific aims of the proposed research include (1) isotopic,                    petrochemical and petrographic characterization of an apparent                  major mantle-derived igneous suite that was added to the crust at               ~100 Ma, and consideration of its role in the formation of a                    granulitic lower crust; (2) study of crustal melting phenomena                  imposed by this mantle igneous suite on a variety of pre-existing               crustal materials that are known to characterize much of the pre-               batholithic framework based on regional map relations; (3) con-                 struction of mixing models between the young mantle-derived                     component and pre-existing crustal materials and the application                of these models to large-scale problems of batholith                            petrogenesis; (4) application of appropriate thermobarometers to                deep-level exposures as a refinement of the crustal section model               and for placing constraints on the physical conditions of peak                  metamorphism and crustal melting; and (5) structural and                        geochronological  analysis of selected ductile shear zones and                  fault systems which appear to be intimately related to batholith                emplacement and volcanic venting.  Large-scale goals of this                    research are to model the major components and material transport               patterns that contributed to the production of the southern                     Sierra sialic crustal column and to consider the implications of                such phenomena for broader issues of continent structure and                    evolution.",
