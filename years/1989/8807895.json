 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kenneth Leopold is supported by a grant from The                         Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform studies on                   the structures and large amplitude motions of weakly bound van                  der Waals complexes and metal clusters.  Dr. Leopold will use a                 new state-of-the-art far infrared technology to study the                       vibrational properties of these clusters.  This very high                       resolution spectroscopic information is not available through                   any other experimental approach.                                                                                                                                   State-of-the-art far infrared technology featuring high                      sensitivity, high resolution, and complete coverage throughout                  the far infrared region will be combined with established                       methods of supersonic jet expansions to study the low frequency                 vibrational spectra of a wide variety of van der Waals species.                 This work is distinct from the majority of other studies on van                 der Waals complexes in that it involves direct excitation of                    the soft intermolecular vibrations, and is made possible by a                   new technique in which tunable far infrared radiation is                        generated from the difference frequency between two carbon                      dioxide lasers.  The results will be crucial to the testing and                 development of new theoretical methods for computing                            intermolecular potential surfaces and for treating the problem                  of large amplitude motion in molecules.  In addition, the                       examination of rotationally resolved vibrational spectra of                     metal trimers will provide high quality information regarding                   the structure, vibrational frequencies, and barrier heights to                  pseudorotation in these species.",
