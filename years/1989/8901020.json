 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to The Vassar College Department of                   Psychology to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates                Site.  The program will center around a group of seven projects                 in experimental psychology that will provide an intensive summer                research experience for ten undergraduates.  These projects,                    which represent ongoing research activity in cognitive,                         perceptual, and physiological psychology, will allow students to                work closely with faculty and with one other, and to gain                       significant competence in current experimental psychological                    research topics and methods.  The students will be drawn from                   both Vassar and selected community colleges with which Vassar has               cooperated for its \"Exploring Transfer\" program.  All relevant                  facilities and resources of the psychology department and the                   college will be available to support the program, and serious,                  advising, follow-up, and evaluation efforts are planned.  The                   overall intellectual and social experience for the participants                 will be enhanced by a weekly psychology research seminar and by                 the larger context of student-faculty collaborative scientific                  research activity that will be taking place on the Vassar campus                during the summer.",
