 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systems with feedback control are ubiquitous components of many modern          devices, industrial processes, and scientific experiments.  However,            outside the realm of the control engineer there is little understanding         of the power available and the limitations incurred when control is             imposed on free systems.  Even less generally appreciated are the               artifacts generated when computers are improperly employed.  This               project is designed to improve the teaching of linear control theory            and, in particular, the teaching of the methods of direct digital               control by computers.  Improved simulation methods will be introduced           to upgrade the instruction regarding the theoretical aspects of control         strategies.  An expanded laboratory course will be established in               which students will be able to experiment with the control strategies           that they have developed.  The equipment employed will be that which is         now coming into widespread use both in industry and in scientific               laboratories.  The methods of networking and concurrent programming             will be taught.  The audience for the course will be undergraduate              physics, chemistry, and computer science majors, and a few engineers            from local industries.                                                                                                                                          The college will match the award with an equal amount of funds.",
