 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry                      Program, focusses on experimental and theoretical studies of                    photodissociation. Details of early-time dynamics on the                        potential surface(s) of the electronically excited state(s)                     will be elucidated by means of spectroscopic techniques.                        Photodissociation is a process of central importance in                         photochemistry and represents one of the most widely studied                    classes of unimolecular reactions.                                                                                                                              The approach relies on the use of absorption spectroscopy                       and/or Raman spectroscopy. The basic measurements are the                       absolute Raman cross-sections for long progressions in                          ground-state vibrational numbers. These measurements will be                    done at several wavelengths within the absorption system                        comprising the dissociative continuum being studied. The                        polarization properties of the scattered light will be                          determined along with the other measurements. The theoretical                   work which will be directly supportive of the experimental                      work, will include dynamic studies modelling the specific                       molecules for which experiments are being done. Molecules to be                 studied include: alkylhalides, hydrogen peroxide, ozone and                     acetone.",
