 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Schiffer and his colleagues will conduct research in                        experimental archaeology to determine the effects of various                    surface treatments on a number of important performance                         characteristics of low-fired, traditional ceramics.  The                        relationship between such treatments as burnishing, smudging,                   corrugation, cord-marking, and stuccoing and the dependent                      variables including thermal shock resistance, heating                           effectiveness of cooking vessels, abrasion resistance, firing                   success, impact resistance and permeability, and evaporative                    cooling effectiveness will be examined.  Experiments will be                    conducted on replicas (vessels and briquettes) using behaviorally               relevant testing procedures.  In a final stage of the project,                  predictions based on the experimental studies will be subjected                 to tests using ethnographic evidence.                                                                                                                           Two years of support will allow Dr. Schiffer's Laboratory of                    Traditional Technology to continue innovative studies of                        traditional ceramics.  Although archaeologists have focussed on                 surface treatments of pottery for decades and devised elaborate                 typologies to categorize them, they have always assumed that                    variation reflects \"style\" and does not serve a functional                      purpose.  Dr. Schiffer has argued that, to the contrary,                        seemingly insignificant differences may affect the functional                   characteristics of a vessel and that traditional potters realized               this and designed pieces with such considerations in mind.                      Because standard techniques of ceramic analysis were not                        developed for pottery fired at low temperatures and not directed                towards such functional questions, Dr. Schiffer has devised and                 applied a series of behaviorally relevant techniques.                                                                                                           This research is important because it will allow archaeologists                 to analyze pottery in a new and potentially significant way.                    Potsherds preserve well in archaeological sites and in many                     regions constitute the major class of data recovered.  Therefore,               they are the focus of much archaeological attention.  With the                  techniques developed by Dr. Schiffer, these remains should yield                new classes of information.",
