 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is about case.based reasoning (\"CBR\") and the                     complementary use of CBR with other reasoning paradigms, such as                those using rules or models.  The specific topic is how and when                to interleave CBR and traditional AI rule.based reasoning (e.g.,                as used in expert systems) and model.based reasoning, in                        particular in the situation when the concepts used in the rules                 or model are not fully defined or admit judgmental decisions.  In               such problems of interpretation a reasoner seeks to determine the               meaning of certain terms and rules as they apply to a given fact                situation.  This is done by consideration of its applications in                past cases.  One reasons about the similarities and differences                 with past cases (precedents) in order to determine whether the                  new case is \"in\" or \"out\" of the category of the rule or predicte               in question.  This investigation will focus on the architecture                 and control of a mixed paradigm system that will enable CBR and                 other reasoning processes to complement each other.  The research               has three high level goals:  (1) describe mixed paradigm                        reasoning on interpretation tasks, such as exemplified by                       problems of interpretation in statutory law; (2) use the results                of (1) to suggest and build architectures and control regimes;                  (3) perform experiments to explore and evaluate the approaches of               (2).  Because certain areas of statutory law offer excellent                    examples for study of such issues, we propose to begin our                      investigations in an area such as tax law, where we already have                experience with CBR techniques.  However, our results will have                 wider application, even to those domains which to date have been                the province of purely rule.based approaches (e.g., diagnostic                  expert systems).",
