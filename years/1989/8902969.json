Before the model has \"spun up\", there is                   an imbalance in the various model processes which adversely                     affects the humidity, precipitation, divergence and evaporation                 fields.  The initial imbalances are due, in large part, to the                  data assimilation scheme.  The goal of this research is to                      reduce the model spin-up time and to improve the precipitation                  forecast by improving the data assimilation scheme.  The                        principal investigator will further refine an assimilation                      technique he has developed in which Newton relaxation, or                       nudging, is used to make the divergence and humidity fields                     consistent with the observed precipitation at the beginning of                  the forecast.                                                                        This project is part of a joint program in numerical                       weather prediction sponsored by NSF and the National                            Meteorological Center (NMC) of NOAA.  The principal                             investigator will use the NMC global forecast model for his                     research.  If the new assimilation scheme is successful, it                     will be used operationally by NMC.",
