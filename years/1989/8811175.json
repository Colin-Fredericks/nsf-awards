 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the proposed research is to                            characterize a class of trans-acting regulatory genes that                      produce an inverse dosage response on the white eye color                       locus.  A saturation mutagenesis involving hybrid dysgenesis,                   ethyl methanesulfonate and X-rays will be conducted to                          recover transposon insertions, point mutants and chromosomal                    rearrangements in inverse regulators effective upon white.                      Secondly, the autosomes will be screened for segmental                          trisomics that alter the expression of white.  A previously                     isolated mutant in an inverse regulator of white will be used                   to determine the tissues in which the recessive                                 recombination.  Other genes expressed in the eye will be                        tested to determine whether these are affected by the inverse                   regulator that works on white.  A refined set of white                          promoter fusions will be constructed and transformed into the                   Drosophila germline.  These will be tested with the inverse                     regulator to determine the sequences of the white gene                          required to respond.  Selected examples of inverse regulators                   that are P element insertion mutants affecting white will be                    cloned and used to analyze the gene products via DNA                            sequencing and protein fusion productions.  Finally, the                        involvement of the inverse effect in X chromosomal dosage                       compensation will be examined by determining whether white                      locus regulatory mutants exhibit dosage compensation in                         metafemales and by conducting a reversion analysis on white-                    ivory, a non-compensating allele that does not respond to                       inverse regulators, to establish whether compensation and                       response to inverse regulators is correlated.                                                                                                                   An understanding of how gene expression is regulated is                         central to insight into genetic mechanisms and development.                     This proposal contains innovative experiments which should                      result in increased knowledge relating to mechanisms involved                   in gene dosage compensation and trans-acting regulatory loci                    in Drosophila.",
