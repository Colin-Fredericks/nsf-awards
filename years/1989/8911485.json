 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chloroplasts are autonomously replicating organelles which                    function to harvest light energy into chemical form in plants.                  They possess their own DNA and replicating machinery.  In this                  renewal project, Dr. Wu will continue studying the control of DNA               replication in the chloroplast of the unicellular green alga,                   Chlamydomonas.  In particular, she will focus on the minimal                    structural requirements for the DNA replication origin, the                     development of an in vitro replication system for studying the                  process, and characterization of a novel 18 kDa iron-sulfur                     containing membrane protein which exhibits very strong binding to               the replication origin and which has electron-transport                         capability.  Some experiments are also proposed using                           chloroplasts isolated from higher plants, to determine if the                   information obtained from the algal system are directly relevant                to higher plant systems.                                                                                                                                        Chloroplast DNA replicates preferentially in the light phase of                 the growth cycle.  The control of DNA replication initiation, and               its relationship to other cellular processes, is not well                       understood.  These proposed experiments promise to shed light on                this problem, not only for the green alga, Chlamydomonas, but                   also for higher plants.",
