At the                       introductory level the NMR is used to demonstrate to general                    education students the relationship between structure and the                   utility of petroleum products; to allied health students, the                   application of NMR in medicine; and to science majors, the                      affect of hybridization on chemical shifts.  In organic chemistry               students gain hands-on experience with NMR through the                          structural analysis of reaction products, unknowns, and during                  ten-week individual projects.  The biochemistry students will                   determine a specific drug binding to proteins through NMR.  In                  physical chemistry, students discover the quantitative utility of               NMR by using it to determine both equilibrium and rate                          constants. The advantages of signal averaging, the principles of                Fourier Transform and pulse NMR spectroscopy, and the                           significance of reaction rates is illustrated in instrumental                   analysis.  An accessible NMR provides the undergraduates with                   the opportunity to participate in research at a higher level than               would otherwise be possible.  The institution is matching the NSF               grant with an equal amount of funds.",
