 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the importance of ambient                        dissolved and intracellular cAMP concentrations, relative to                    other physical and chemical factors, in regulating in situ                      photosynthetic performance in epilimnetic planktonic assemblages.               Experiments conducted in eutrophic Sangre Isle lake will be used                to accomplish the following objectives: (1) Develop a                           comprehensive seasonal and diel model of in situ cAMP dynamics                  in epilimnetic lake water.  These experiments will use both                     previously published methods and novel HPLC and monoclonal                      antibody techniques to identify the key organisms driving cAMP                  dynamics; (2) Test the hypothesis that seasonal and diel                        phytoplanktonic PCA rates are influenced by naturally-occurring                 dissolved or particulate cAMP concentrations; (3) Using the                     activated charcoal method for cAMP removal from lake water                      developed under previous funding, test the hypothesis that                      removal of naturally-occurring cAMP from lake water alter                       planktonic PCA rates, and that readdition of cAMP restores PCA                  rates to nominal levels; and, (4) Conduct membrane polarity and                 proton translocation experiments, on planktonic isolates from                   Sangre Isle Lake to test the cAMP electrogenic regulation model                 in natural planktonic assemblages.  These experiments should                    determine if cAMP is an important regulator of phytoplankton                    production in aquatic systems.",
