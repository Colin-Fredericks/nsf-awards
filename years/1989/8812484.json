 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports continued studies with three enzymes                      closely related to the malate branching point of metabolism,                    the NAD malic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and                       malate dehydrogenase.  The studies planned include several                      distinct research efforts with each enzyme.  These include                      among others, the means by which MDH is regulated; the role                     of diurnal changes in leaf composition in controlling                           Crassula malic enzyme; study of the kinetics of aggregation                     of all three enzymes and identification of the amino acids                      composing the active and regulatory sites of PEPC.                                                                                                              This project has for several years been devoted to the study                    of the metabolic reactions around malate in an effort to help                   with the understanding of how these critical metabolic steps                    relate to the ability of plants to adapt to permanently                         stressed conditions (e.g. CAM), survive transient stresses                      (e.g. low temperatures or low nutrients), carry out functions                   requiring temporary provision of high levels of energy or                       anaplerotic activity such as fruit development, or to make                      special adjustments providing high competitiveness such as C4                   metabolism.***//",
