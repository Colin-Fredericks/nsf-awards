 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), a provision of the           Food Security Act of 1985, the federal government pays more than a              billion dollars annually to landowners who have agreed to retire more           than 25 million acres of cropland.  Little is known, however, about the         efficiency or equity of this program or its role in shaping land use in         America.  Using a geographical perspective, this project will involve           the use of map-based documentary evidence and intensive fieldwork,              including interviews conducted in 16 study areas.  It will integrate            data from disparate elements of the discipline of geography, including          detailed information on the subtle gradients in agricultural land use           and practices, micro-spatial patterns of soil productivity and                  erodibility within individual landholdings, and the influence of                regional perceptions on landowners as they respond to changing economic         and political conditions.                                                                                                                                            The primary focus of this project is at the heart of geography,            that is, the recording of patterns of land use and the subsequent               identification of factors that help explain those patterns.  Such an            analysis in this context has the potential to lead to the development           of new theory encompassing long-run dynamic effects of how farmers act                                                                                          in anticipation of government policies.",
