 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regulation of initiation of chromosome replication in                       Bacillus subtilis will be investigated .  It still is not yet                   well understood.  The mechanism likely involves a multi-                        component structure inbedded in the cellular membrane which                     consists of specific DNA fragments and proteins.  As for the                    protein components, the structure and function of the proteins                  encoded by the dnaB operon genes will be worked out.  The                       function of the dnaB protein is essential for the replication                   initiation of the chromosome.  The gene and its flanking regions                have been cloned and sequenced.  The dnaB gene turned out to be                 the first gene of an operon which consists of three or four                     genes, dnaB, Y-,Z-and possibly   genes.  Specific antisera                      against the first three have been prepared and will be used to                  isolate proteins encoded by the genes of the dnaB operon.                       Antibodies will be also used for the studies of the in vitro                    initiation.  Attempts will be made to isolate mutants of the Y-                 and Z-genes.  With regard to the DNA fragments involved in the                  replication initiation, we will study the nature of the two types               of membrane binding of the replication origin areas of the B.                   subtilis chromosome and a plasmid pUB110.  The type-I membrane                  binding is salt-resistant and dependent on the dnaB+ gene                       function, whereas type-II binding is salt-sensitive and                         independent of the dnaB+ gene function.  It is believed that type               I binding is essential for biochemical processes of initiation                  and type.II binding is important for pUB110 and the chromosomal                 original to be bound to a structure on the membrane that is                     essential for both initiation of replication and the partition of               daughter chromosomes.                                                                                                                                           The type -I binding site seems to be located at or near the                     origin of replication both in the B. subtilis chromosome and                    pUB110.  Type-II binding is found in four areas of the pUB110                   molecule and in two areas near the purA16 locus that is located                 within 20.50 kb from the replication origin of the B.subtilis                   chromosome.  The properties and functional significance of these                bindings will be analayzed further.",
