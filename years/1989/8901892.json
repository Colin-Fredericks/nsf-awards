 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of                  Professor Tzuong T. Moh of Purdue University. His project is to                 prove that any algebraic variety in positive characteristic may                 be desingularized. In the case of a curve in the plane, whose                   defining equation may be complicated enough that the curve                      crosses over itself, it is not hard to imagine lifting one                      intersecting branch of the curve up out of the plane so as to                   remove the selfintersections, or \"singularities\". This was done                 in the last century not only conceptually, but by algebraic                     transformations, so that the originally singular (self-                         intersecting) curve now sat in a higher-dimensional space but no                longer intersected itself. This was done also for algebraic                     spaces of any dimension, but still in the geometrically intuitive               domain of zero-characteristic, in 1964 by Hironaka. It is                       Professor Moh's aim to desingularize algebraic spaces of                        arbitrary dimension in the less intuitive and algebraically                     difficult domain of positive characteristic.                                         This research is work in the algebraic geometry of positive                characteristic. Although the field originated with notions of                   continuously varying geometric structures like lines and planes,                in this context the discrete takes over, and methods akin to                    those from the theory of whole numbers are most useful.                         Reciprocally, the algebraic geometry of positive characteristic                 is now having great influence on the Theory of Numbers, and is                  finding application in Computer Science and Coding Theory.",
