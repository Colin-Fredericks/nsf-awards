Each of the 180 participants, most of them from               northern Ohio, will attend 2 six-week summer sessions in which he               or she will focus on one of three related \"strands\":                            computer science, mathematics, and the use of computers to                      teach mathematics.  Academic-year activities will include two                   meetings of the participants, visits by project staff to                        their classrooms, and an annual conference at Kent State                        University.  The evaluation will assess changes in the                          participants' knowledge, skills, and attitudes, in their                        teaching strategies, in their schools' curricula, and in                        their students' achievement.  During the third year of the                      project, dissemination to other states will begin.                                                                                                              Kent State University and the State of Ohio are contributing                    in cost-sharing an amount that is equal to 28% of the NSF                       award.",
