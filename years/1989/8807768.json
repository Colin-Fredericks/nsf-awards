 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several problems involving convective processes in climate                 and numerical weather prediction can be addressed by developing a               cumulus parameterization incorporating life-cycle effects of                    cumulus convection and treating the dynamic as well as the                      thermodynamic interactions between cumulus convection and the                   large-scale flow.  Incorporating life-cycle effects changes the                 vertical distribution of large-scale forcing.  Additional changes               in parameterized large-scale forcing by cumulus convection can be               achieved by adding a simple formulation for the water budget of                 mesoscale stratiform precipitation to the parameterization for                  deep cumulus convection.  Large-scale vorticity generation by                   cumulus convection can be parameterized on the basis of the                     evolution of potential vorticity in the presence of latent heat                 release, with the vorticity generation to be recovered after the                effect of cumulus convection on the thermodynamic portion of the                potential vorticity has been calculated using a conventional                    cumulus parameterization.  The resulting parameterizations can be               incorporated into a general circulation model to study their                    impact on simulation of large-scale dynamics and climate.                            Tracer transport by a cumulus ensemble can be parameterized,               if tracer concentrations within the cumulus elements and sources                due to cloud chemical processes are known.  The cumulus                         parameterization incorporating cumulus life-cycle effects can be                extended for this purpose.                                                           An important problem in numerical weather prediction is the                \"spin-up\" of convective heating.  A technique to initialize                     temperature and humidity fields consists of inverting a cumulus                 parameterization such that diagnosed heating rates will be                      produced by the parameterization with the initialized fields.                   Using such an initialization with a forecast model and studying                 its sensitivity to cumulus parameterization will yield important                results on initialization and the role of physical processes in                 numerical weather prediction.                                                        This research is important because it seeks to develop more                realistic ways to represent sub-grid scale processes in computer                models of the climate system.",
