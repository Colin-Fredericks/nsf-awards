 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to improve our understanding of the                   implicit, unconscious aspects of human thought.  It is well known               that people learn things without being aware of having learned                  them.  The most compelling examples of this are the natural                     language we each learned as a child and the complex social-                     cultural mores of our society.                                                                                                                                  In recent years cognitive psychologists have come to understand a               good deal about this process and how it differs from the                        conscious, explicit learning that takes place in the full light                 of awareness.  The research in this project is designed to                      explore several novel extensions of this work, particularly how                 implicit learning emerges in special populations and how it                     differs from conscious learning.                                                                                                                                Specifically, the research will examine the degree to which these               unconscious processes continue to operate in persons with mild                  depression and/or anxiety, conditions which are known to                        interfere with conscious learning processes.  The project will                  also explore the manner in which young children display the                     capacity for implicit learning, with the expectation that they                  will be fully capable of learning about highly complex systems so               long as they are not consciously trying to learn.  An additional                important question the research will examine is whether or not                  these implicit processes change with age as conscious learning is               known to.  To this end the research will examine children from                  ages four through twelve.  Finally, the project will explore the                relationships between implicit learning, conscious learning, and                intelligence, as measured by standard IQ tests.                                                                                                                 The research has implications for a number of important issues in               cognitive psychology, particularly the relationship between                     implicit learning and various complex human skills which people                 routinely display but which lie largely outside of awareness.                   Key examples are the development of intuitive judgment, the                     acquisition of sophisticated skills such as those displayed in                  medical diagnosis, the development of high level skills in                      complex games like chess, and the capacity to adjust to cultural                and organizational settings.",
