 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Kevin                Prendergast, Columbia University and a group of French astronomers              from the Observatoire de Marseille, France, led by Dr. Evangelie                Athanassoulas.  The objective of the project is to study galactic               structure and evolution using a multifluid code to follow the                   motions and interactions of stars, gas and dark matter.  The                    existing code embodies star formation, evolution and mass loss,                 together with stellar heating and radiative cooling of the gas.                 Integrations with a spherical version of the two-fluid code have                yielded a theoretical Faber-Jackson relation, which can be matched              to observed ellipticals in the Coma and Virgo clusters.  Other                  results indicate that galaxies of intermediate mass are subject to              outgassing, while high mass systems are not.  This may indicate a               possible reason for the differences between ordinary and dwarf                  systems.  Low mass systems may be entirely disrupted by the same                process which leads to outgassing in systems of intermediate mass.                                                                                              In this project the investigators will continue the work with the               existing code, and construct an axisymmetric version, in the hope               that the Fisher-Tully relation will emerge from stimulations of                 rotating galaxies.  The U.S. and French investigators have                      significant expertise in the area of proposed research, and the                 project will benefit from the special facilities available at the               Marseille Observatory.  The results of this work are expected to                contribute to our understanding of galactic structure and                       evolution.",
