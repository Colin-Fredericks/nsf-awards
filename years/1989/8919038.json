 "awd_abstract_narration": "NRI will conduct a research program on very high speed                     networks in cooperation with industry, academia, national                       laboratories, and several major supercomputer centers to explore                alternative very high-speed architectures and to determine how to               utilize them most effectively.  Three wide-area testbeds and two                metropolitan testbeds will be established to carry out                          experimental portions of the program. Applications of very-high                 speed networks shall be used as vehicles to explore network                     performance.  These applications include distributed computation,               composite visualization, and interactive control of a distributed               computation and will be conducted on two of the wide-area                       testbeds.  The technical foci of these testbeds are                             supercomputer-network interfaces and network integration,                       respectively.  The primary focus of the third wide-area testbed                 is on switching and network control.  One of the metropolitan                   testbeds focuses on interfacing workstations and supercomputers                 to a gigabit network and developing software to make them work                  together.  The other demonstrates sequential use of distributed                 resources for interactive display and modification of computer                  generated images.",
