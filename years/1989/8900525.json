 "awd_abstract_narration": "A continuation of mathematical research aimed at the                       development of a comprehensive and unified theory of                            symmetrization will be carried out in this project.  The                        application of symmetry to problems in mathematical analysis                    represents one of the most powerful paradigms for the resolution                of extremal problems in very general contexts.  It is often the                 case that fundamental inequalities reach their extreme values                   under conditions of symmetry and great regularity.  The                         isoperimetric inequality is perhaps the best example of such an                 event.                                                                               This work seeks to exploit a recently discovered master                    inequality; an inequality containing some of the most basic                     relationships used in analysis.  These are inequalities relating                integrals of gradients, triple convolutions and the Laplace                     operator, three integral inequalities which play essential roles                in the theory of differential equations, potential theory and the               theory of analytic functions - to name a few.                                        Specific applications will touch on the problem of the Bloch               and Landau constants from function theory.  These are measures of               the largest disc in the range of (normalized) analytic functions.               Another question which may yet be resolved by symmetrization is                 that of the lowest eigenvalue of a clamped plate.  The analogous                question for the vibrating membrane has been known for years.  In               the former case (the biharmonic equation governs), there is a                   delicate matter involving the change of sign in the lowest                      eigenvalue which must first be resolved.  Extremal problems for                 complex polynomials, integrability of powers of the derivatives                 of confomal maps and area distortion of quasiconformal maps will                also be treated in this project.",
