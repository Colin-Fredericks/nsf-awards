 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oceans may be a significant source of many trace gases                 that affect the global environment.  Trace gases that                           accumulate in the atmosphere can change the chemistry and                       composition of the atmosphere.  These changes can lead to                       climatic effects such as global warming and altered rainfall                    patterns.  Global emissions of trace gases from natural sources                 are particularly difficult to estimate and little is known                      about production of gases in the oceans.  This project will                     provide data that can improve our understanding of the role of                  the oceans in determining the levels of certain trace gases.                         This project is a follow-up on a supplement to a previous                  grant that allowed the collection of air and seawater samples                   during a cruise of the Akademik Korolev in the Pacific.  The                    samples will be chemically analyzed for carbon monoxide, methyl                 halides, and haloforms.  Carbon monoxide is important in that                   it is a primary species for the loss of hydroxyl radical.  The                  hydroxyl radical, in turn, largely controls the oxidizing                       capacity of the atmosphere which is responsible for the removal                 of many trace gases.  The methyl halides are generally the most                 abundant halogen containing trace gases and the oceans are                      probably their most significant natural source.  By using                       statistical techniques and cluster analysis, the air and                        seawater                                                                        concentrations of these trace gases will be correlated with each                other and with other parameters such as biological productivity                 and temperature.  Objectives of this project are to delineate the               latitudinal distributions of these gases and thus evaluate the                  distributions of their sources and to estimate fluxes of these                  gases through the ocean-atmosphere boundary.",
