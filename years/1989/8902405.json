 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasma based processes are used in technologies such as the                     fabrication of very-large-scale-integrated (VLSI) micro-electronic              devices.  A plasma reactor consists of a wafer placed between two               electrodes (one powered and one grounded).  The plasma flows through            the annulus and etching and deposition of films is accomplished by              ions that are accelerated towards the wafer in conjunction with                 neutrals that diffuse to the wafer.  Volatile reaction products                 diffuse back into the bulk of the plasma where they participate in a            complex chain of collision processes.  Two areas about which more               information is needed are the surface of the wafer where the etching            and deposition occur and the plasma where the reactive species are              produced.  The PI is interested in elucidating the processes that               occur in the plasma and using that information to increase                      understanding of the plasma-surface interaction including the flux and          nature of the species that impinge on the surface.                                                                                                              Reactive plasma constituent are produced from inert feed gases by               various electron collision processes.  This grant will supply funds to          enable the PI to build a versatile corrosion-resistent electron-impact          fragment spectrometer that will allow a comprehensive study of the              electron impact dissociation of those key industrial gases that are             currently employed in low temperature processing plasmas.  The                  instrument will be equipped                                                     with diagnostic tools (eg. optical spectroscopy, time-of-flight                 (TOF) and TOF-mass spectroscopy, and laser-induced-flourescence                 spectroscopy) to measure absolute cross sections and appearance                 potentials for the formation of radiating, metastable and neutral               as well as charged ground-state fragments produced by                           dissociative electron impact.  The experimental results will be                 used to predict and optimized the performance characteristics of                a discharge device which will ultimately be used in the design,                 operation and control of novel plasma processing reactors.",
