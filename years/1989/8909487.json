 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drugs such as cocaine, the opiates and nicotine lose much of                    their effectiveness--that is, show tolerance--after repeated                    administration.  It was once thought that the development of drug               tolerance depended exclusively only on exposure to the drug.                    However, it is now quite clear that learned associations with the               environmental conditions within which drugs are taken, referred                 to as drug-related cues, can greatly influence this tolerance                   process.  Dr. Caggiula and his colleagues have recently                         demonstrated that tolerance to both the analgesic and appetite-                 suppressant effects of nicotine are strongly influenced by                      learned associations with environmental cues signaling drug                     delivery.  Administering the drug in the absence of these cues                  reverses the tolerance, and, renders the drug significantly more                effective.  Dr. Caggiula is now extending and complementing this                work with more detailed learning analyses.  The first series of                 studies focuses on pharmacological and learning variables that                  control the maintenance of tolerance, using rats that had                       previously been made tolerant to the anorectic effects of                       nicotine.  The second series of experiments are investigating                   which factors that are responsible for the development of                       tolerance in drug-naive rats.",
