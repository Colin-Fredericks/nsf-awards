 "awd_abstract_narration": "The enormous impact of physics upon health care technology                 has led the Physics and Biology Faculty at Loyola College to re-                evaluate the introductory physics laboratory course for life                    science majors.  A hands-on approach geared towards practical,                  useful applications of physics is an excellent way to learn the                 process of doing physics.                                                                                                                                            The project introduces fundamental physics concepts using                  robot technology, an important area for bioengineering and                      industry.  Through a series of seven \"lab projects\", each focused               on a set of related physical principles, an integrated program on               robotics will be taught in coordination with the lectures.  The                 culmination of the course would be the actual construction of                   four robotic arms and two mobile robots.  Basic hardware                        components form the bulk of the equipment list to allow                         creativity in design.  This approach reflects the belief that the               students will develop a deeper appreciation of physics if they                  first understand how individual components work and later the                   interconnections necessary for a complex physical system.                       Combined with the students' natural curiosity in robots, this                   proposed work will stimulate continued enthusiasm in learning                   physics.                                                                                                                                                             The College will match the award with an equal amount.",
