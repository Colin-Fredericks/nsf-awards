 "awd_abstract_narration": "As our society balances community needs and individual rights,                  an energetic data dissemination program by government agencies in               support of public policy research must have parity with an                      effective disclosure limitation program.  The substantial growth                which has occured in the number of publicly collected microdata                 files in recent years has made it increasingly difficult,                       however,  to reconcile the public's interest in scientific                      inquiry with its equally legitimate interest in protecting                      individual privacy.                                                                                                                                             This project seeks to promote the usefulness of federal                         statistical data through the development of methodologies that                  will allow important types of social data to be accessible while                assuring an appropriate level of confidentiality.  Specifically,                the aim is both to develop and evaluate disclosure-limiting                     techniques that will help guide microdata dissemination.  The                   disclosure-limiting data disseminating approach advanced by                     Duncan and Lambert in 1985 will be extended to both complete                    census data and sample data.  Examination will be made in the DL                context of a variety of proposed disclosure avoidance techniques,               for both reidentification and data base query situations.                                                                                                       There are four kinds of resolutions between the tension between                 dissemination and disclosure:  ethical guidelines to encourage                  responsible use of data;  administrative rules to control access                to data;  legal specifications that delineate when data may or                  may not be used;  and statistical techniques to mask data on                    individuals without compromising information about the group.                   The approach embraced in this proposal has potential                            applicability to all four kinds of disclosure limitations.  To                  date,  only statistical controls have had any exploration in this               framework.  The proposed research would effect a significant                    extension to ethical guidelines,  administrative rules,  and                    legal specifications.",
