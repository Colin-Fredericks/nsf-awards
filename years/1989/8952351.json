The equipment          includes four new learning stations for laboratories in the new course          as well as for use in General Biology. Included are digital storage             units to freeze rapid transient data for analysis by students and               faculty. In addition to educating students (many of whom are                    minorities) in basic physiological processes, the equipment will also           be used to train students in methods of interfacing instrumentation             with computers for data acquisition, storage, retrieval, and                    interpretation.                                                                 The University will provide 50% matching funds.",
