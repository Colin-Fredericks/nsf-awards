 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chloroplast genome contains on the order of 100 genes;                      the proper expression of which are necessary for                                photosynthesis and chloroplast development.  A critical step                    in the expression of a number of chloroplast genes is RNA                       splicing; the process where internally-located sequences                        (introns) are excised, and coding sequences (exons) are                         precisely religated.  Comparative sequence analysis suggests                    that most chloroplast introns can be classified as Group I or                   Group II, however, there is very little direct information on                   the mechanism of RNA splicing in chloroplasts.  Here, results                   are presented which indicate that (1) at least one nuclear                      gene product is required for efficient splicing of the rrn                      23S intron of Chlamydomonas in vivo and, (2) 23S preRNA is                      capable of self-splicing in vitro.  Preliminary evidence is                     also presented which suggests that introns of the psbA gene                     of Photosystem II and other unidentified Group I introns in                     Chlamydomonas are capable of self-splicing. Studies are                         proposed to elucidate, as far as possible, the mechanism and                    control of splicing of chloroplast Group I introns.  Both in                    vitro (self-splicing) and in vivo (genetic) approaches will                     be utilized.                                                                                                                                                    Understanding the mechanism and control of RNA splicing in                      chloroplasts is important for at least two reasons.  The                        first is due to the fact that plants are the primary source                     of biologically useful energy on this planet.  Plants obtain                    energy through the process of photosynthesis, which is                          dependent, at least in part, on the expression and regulation                   of chloroplast-encoded genes.  Secondly, there are many                         unanswered questions concerning the origin, function, and                       splicing of introns in eucaryotes; the role of trans-acting                     factors are of particular interest because of their probable                    role in regulating intron-related processes.  Although the                      chloroplast genome has coevolved with the nuclear and                           mitochondrial genomes of plant cells, it has a distinct                         origin and many unique characteristics.  Therefore, could be                    a useful source a new basic information on cellular and                         molecular processes that involve introns.",
