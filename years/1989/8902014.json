 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative effort between Professors M. Karpovsky at               Boston University and D. Pradhan at the University of Massachusetts.            The proposedinvestigations are two.fold.  The first concerns fault              detection by acompression of test responses.  Errors (manifestations of         faults) are definedas the component.wise exclusive OR between actual            test responses and fault.free responses.  Faults are masked if the              observed signature (compressed testresponse) is equal to the reference.         Thus, depending on the statistics of theerrors, an optimal compressor           is the compressor that minimizes a probabilitythat the test responses           are compressed into the reference.  The design ofoptimal compressors            when the distribution of ones contained in error sequencesis known for          a given circuit under test is being investigated.  This work isalso             based on single error correcting codes over a finite field.  Second             isboard.level diagnosis by signature analysis.  The objective is to             analyzetradeoffs between the hardware complexity of the redundant chips         on the boardand test time.  Two techniques, based on compression of             test responses, arebeing pursued.  These are; space.time compression of         test responses, anextension of previous research in space compressors;          and board diagnosis byHamming codes over a finite field.                        Professors Karpovsky and Pradhan, are outstanding researchers with              solidrecords of accomplishment over the past decade, and that they are          very likelyto continue first class research.  The research topic, test          response analysis,is important to industry, and is a high.priority              category within the Design,Tools and Test Program.",
