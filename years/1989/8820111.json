 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative            research project in earthquake engineering and hazards reduction                between Branislav Verbic, Faculty of Civil Engineering at the                   University of Sarajevo, and Anestis Veletsos, Rice University, is to            evaluate the response of building foundations supported in sandy soil           and on clays when subjected to seismic motion. The investigators will           test current theoretical solutions to determine foundation stiffness            and rigidity under simulated seismic conditions; and compare their data         with past tests. If significant disagreement is found, new improved             theoretical solutions will be proposed.  This proposal combines the             theoretical and experimental expertise of the U.S. and Yugoslav                 scientists.  Soil/structure interaction studies performed under seismic         duress have significant implications for building and site construction         in earthquake sensitive areas in the U.S. and Yugoslavia.                                                                                                       This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint             fund of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav governments.          The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the Department of State.          No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to the principal Yugoslav           institution.  Dollar funds are included for U.S. scientist travel to            Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
