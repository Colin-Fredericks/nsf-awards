 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a method for the design of linkages which                 allows for determining the linkage dimensions directly from                     specifications on the applied or transmitted forces and moments.                Linkages form the basis of many mechanical systems.  They may have              either closed chain or open chain (a robot) configurations, and may             require multiple actuators to simultaneously control several                    independent degrees of freedom.  It has become standard practice                to design linkages with position, velocity, and acceleration                    requirements as the foremost criteria in determining linkage                    kinematic parameters.  In contrast to the primacy of position based             design, force is usually considered secondarily after the kinematic             geometry is determined, and is used to size actuators or structural             and transmission members.  This research develops the theory for                force based design which allows forces and moments to be taken into             account in a more direct manner and earlier in the design process               than heretofore possible.  In addition to leading to an expanded                kinematic theory, the results should lead to more efficient and                 optimized designs.  In summary, the research goal is as follows:                given a requirement for prescribed wrenches (a system of force and              moment) to be applied at prescribed points in space, develop a                  systematic procedure for determining the dimensions of all linkages             of a given type and structure which will satisfy the requirements.              The project comprises five topics including dimensional synthesis               of open chain linkages to match wrench specifications, dimensional              synthesis of closed loop linkages to match wrench specifications,               design for incompletely specified wrenches (when not all six wrench             parameters need to be specified), design for combined motion-wrench             constraints, and design of linkages with springs or dynamic effects             to match wrench constraints.  This work should lead to new                      approaches to mechanical design which supplement and enhance                    traditional position based methods.",
