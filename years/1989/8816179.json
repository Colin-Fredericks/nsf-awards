 "awd_abstract_narration": "Salt marshes and marsh foraminiferal assemblages of                        northeastern North America differ appreciably from those of the                 Gulf of Mexico, yet the crucial faunal transitions between them--               especially marsh assemblages characteristic of the southeastern                 U.S. coast--remain essentially unstudied.  Similarly, short- and                long-term aspects of loss, preservation, or redistribution of                   foraminiferal tests in these sediments remains largely unknown.                 The work proposed herein is designed to address both problems:                  the ecologic and taphonomic significance of southeastern salt                   marsh foraminifera.                                                                  Modern and relict (-200 to 1500+ year old) salt marsh                      sediments of St. Catherines Island, Georgia, provide and ideal                  setting for studies on the taphonomy and paleoecology of salt                   marsh foraminifera.  Modern marshes are extensive and provide                   examples of modern environments for comparisons with the                        \"paleoenvironments\" of the older relict deposits.  Relict salt                  marsh sediments, extensively exposed along the eastern margin of                the island, contain key, well-preserved, in situ features that                  permit the identification of those specific salt marsh habitats                 and subenvironments that have been described in modern marshes.                 Foraminifera and other microfossils are abundant in these                       deposits.  A distributional study on foraminifera of these relict               deposits therefore can be achieved utilizing essentially the same               methods applicable to studies on modern marshes.                                     The purpose of this study is to document and compare                       distributional patterns of foraminifera in modern and relict                    marsh sediments of St. Catherines.  Results will address problems               of biogeography, ecology, paleoecology, paleoenvironmental                      interpretations, and particularly the assessment of taphonomy                   and taphofacies.",
