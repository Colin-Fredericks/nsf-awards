 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prime objectives of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative               research project in earthquake engineering between Miha Tomazevic at            Lubljana's Institute for Testing and Research in Materials and                  Structures and James L. Noland, Atkinson-Noland Associates are to:  (1)         develop a standardized testing procedure to determine wind, earthquake          resistence of masonry walls; and (2) a mathematical analytical model            for purpose of predicting the behavior of masonry buildings subjected           to earthquakes. By testing different kinds of masonry walls in                  different countries, the investigators expect to develop an                     international model that can be used in the earthquake analysis and             design of masonry buildings in the United States and European                   community.                                                                                                                                                      This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint             fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and Yugoslav            governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the                 Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made to            the principal Yugoslav institute.  Dollar funds are included for U.S.           scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav scientists' living              expenses in the U.S.",
