 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objective of the proposed research is to use lead and               zinc trace metals derived form point sources of known historical                ages to quantify and model erosional and depositional effects of                floods and the long-term downstream transport of sediment and                   trace metals.  The research addresses the long-standing problem                 that little previous quantitative data has been available to                    document the sensitivity of sediment storage at various time                    scales and geographic locations in drainage systems.  The                       proposed research will quantify response rates and processes that               describe the movement and storage of sediment under varying time                scales and flood events.  Results from the modeling and                         quantification of the long-term fate of lead and zinc metals in                 floodplain sediment of the study area should serve as a general                 model to further understand the long-term behavior of many toxic                substances that are associated with water transported sediment.",
