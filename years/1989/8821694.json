 "awd_abstract_narration": "The biological diversity of wildlife populations worldwide is                   threatened.  Population growth and man's ever-pressing need for natural         resources is rapidly causing the decline and extinction of many animal          species.  In general, the scientific community agrees that new                  technologies which have been developed for improving humankind could be         valuable for helping to conserve wild species.  \"Biotechnology\", the            collective term for those procedures useful for enhancing reproducing           and curing diseases in humans and domestic livestock, may be a first            line of defense in preserving endangered species.                                                                                                               Presently, there are few funding programs specifically designed to              support research which could benefit conservation of wildlife                   diversity.  This two and one-half day workshop will gather together             experts in the fields of reproduction, genetics, population and release         biology, and stress and disease to discuss the most crucial areas of            wildlife research deserving federal and private support.  Two days of           the meeting will concentrate on intense discussions and the preparation         of a 15 to 20 page paper which will identify and prioritize the various         areas of research needed.  On the last half day of the workshop,                leaders of the various discussion groups will present their findings            and answer questions from invited representatives of federal and                private funding organizations.  The final workshop document will serve          as a guide for all funding organizations interested in supporting               species conservation.",
