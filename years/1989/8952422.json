 "awd_abstract_narration": "Macalester will develop a multi-purpose computer laboratory for the             geological sciences.  The laboratory would be configured with a                 network of MacIntosh II computers to allow for interaction between              the instructor and the students.  The laboratory will be used in four           fundamental areas:  quantitative and symbolic modelling and                     simulation of geologic processes; analysis and interpretation of                geologic data; student development of expert systems; as a link with            the image processing centers and other computer facilities on campus.                                                                                           Laboratory exercises, experiments, and simulations will be developed            for use in courses ranging from the introductory level to courses               designated only for upper division geology majors.  The laboratory              will provide the introductory students with the tools necessary to              visualize and understand even the complex geologic processes and                encourage them to continue to explore courses in geology.  Also,                early and continued use of the laboratory will help students develop            the quantitative and analytical skills required of geologists.                                                                                                  The college is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
