 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since its initial development four decades ago, input-output               analysis has been a powerful and adaptive tool for studying the                 structure and dynamics of economies at a variety of geographic scales.          Recent research projects have expanded the ways in which input-output           analyses have been conceptualized and used, and new algorithms have             been developed.  This project will continue the development of new uses         for input-output analysis by pursuing four related lines of inquiry.            First, alternative techniques for identifying the fundamental economic          structure of economies will be developed.  These techniques will be             empirically tested, and an initial classification of economies based on         this concept will be undertaken.  Second, the impacts of changes in             economic structures will be examined by analyzing and empirically               testing \"fields of influence\" of coefficients within input-output               models.  Third, alternative forms of decomposing economic structures            will be empirically studied in order to more effectively analyze the            nature and transmission of change throughout economic systems.  Fourth,         new understandings of fundamental economic structure, fields of                 influence of input-output coefficients, and economic decompositions             will be synthesized to examine the simulated impacts of technological           development and the diffusion of new innovations.  These analyses will          be undertaken by collaborating investigators from the U.S., Australia,          Israel, and Korea.                                                                   This research will increase both theoretical and empirical                 knowledge.  The related enhancement of techniques to further                    understandings of fundamental economic structure, fields of influence           of coefficients, and economic decompositions will enable input-output           analyses to be used to examine a broader range of problems, especially          issues related to changes in economic activities and to the functional          settings in which economic systems operate.  Because these new                  techniques will be tested with data from the U.S., Canada, Europe, and          Australia, new insights on economic structure and relationships in              those locales will likely result from this work, but even more                  important from an empirical standpoint will be refinement of methods            that will enable their use with data from other regions.",
