 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid deforestation in the tropics is resulting in the                     extinction of many species.  This problem is compounded in the                  West Indies by the limited distributions of species and an ever                 increasing human population.  West Indian amphibians and reptiles               (>570 sp.) are especially susceptible to extinction because most                species are restricted to small areas within each island.  New                  species continue to be discovered at a high rate indicating that                our knowledge of the actual species diversity is incomplete.                    Cuba and Hispaniola are the two largest islands in the West                     Indies, harbor the greatest number of species, and have the                     least known amphibian and reptile faunas.                                            The first goal of this research is to document the existing                species diversity of amphibians and reptiles by conducting                      exploratory field studies in poorly known regions of Cuba and                   Hispaniola.  This aspect involves the formal scientific                         description of new species as well as studies that provide new or               corrected information on previously described species.  The                     second goal is to use modern genetic techniques to uncover the                  genealogical relationships of the species.  This information is                 valuable for testing existing theories and developing new ones in               the field of evolutionary biology.  It will also help in                        understanding how the many species of plants and animals                        inhabiting the islands of the West Indies originated.",
