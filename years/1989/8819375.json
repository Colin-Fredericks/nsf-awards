 "awd_abstract_narration": "Remote sensing of the atmosphere using lasers is referred to as lidar,          an acronym for \"light detection and ranging\" and is analogous to                radar.  The transmission of short pulses of laser light is followed by          reception of backscattered signals from atmospheric constituents such           as aerosols, dust, clouds or molecules. Information about the                   composition and physical state of the atmosphere can be deduced from            the lidar data.  In addition, the time lag of the received signal               determines the range of the scattering species.  This research is to            derive and calculate the received power from a lidar system, both               coherent and direct detection.  The effects of pulse shape,                     turbulence, transmitter, receiver and local oscillator will be                  determined; the effects of the motion of the atmosphere will be                 investigated; and physics of the important mechanisms will be                   identified.  There is a regime where turbulence is the dominating               physical mechanism.  The feasibility of estimating turbulence levels            from lidar measurements in this regime will also be investigated.  The          theoretical results will be obtained from a recent series solution for          statistics of waves propagating in random media.  This provides a               solution for very general conditions with a minimum of approximations.          Based on these results, comparison between coherent and direct                  detection will be performed and an apparent error in the lidar                  equation for coherent detection will be investigated.  The feasibility          of deducing turbulence profiles from lidar measurements will also be            investigated.",
