 "awd_abstract_narration": "PATHS/PRISM is a program of The Philadelphia Partnership for                    Education, representing colleges and universities, foundations, and             corporations in partnership with the School District of                         Philadelphia. The acronym PATHS stands for the Philadelphia Alliance            for Teaching Humanities in the Schools; PRISM stands for the                    Philadelphia Renaissance in Science and Mathematics. This project,              submitted by PRISM as a representative of the Greater Philadelphia              Regional Consortium, involves a cooperative effort among the                    following institutions and organizations: four metropolitan school              districts; thirteen universities, colleges and community colleges;              museums; corporations; and minority community organizations. Leading            higher education partners in the Consortium include Lincoln, Temple,            and Drexel Universities, and the University of Pennsylvania. It                 consists of a set of coordinated activities, targeted throughout                Metropolitan Philadelphia, designed to significantly increase the               representation of minorities in careers in science, engineering and             technology. The formal consortium, already in existence, was                    established to further these efforts.                                                                                                                           Figures on minority enrollments in the colleges and universities in             the Consortium show Lincoln University (1,245, 90%), the Community              College of Philadelphia (6.642, 45%) and Temple University (4,898,              16%). Minority enrollment in the School District of Philadelphia is             141,351 (73%).                                                                                                                                                  The central programmatic strategy of the Center is to focus on the              introduction to and retention of minority students in the science,              mathematics and engineering pipeline from the first grade through the           undergraduate years. This is being accomplished through the                     integration of three principal components: Precollege professional              development programs in science and mathematics for teachers;                   Precollege student programs; and College level programs.                                                                                                        Under the precollege rubric, the first category includes five                   programs which will be implemented with a focus on teachers,                    counselors and parents: The Elementary and Middle School Project                (teachers); The Secondary School Project (teachers); The Mathematics            Project (elementary and middle school teachers); The Teacher/Private            Sector Project; and, Counselor & Parent Programs.                                                                                                               The second category of precollege activities, designed for students             (Grades 9-12), includes a set of projects originally developed and              implemented by PRIME (Philadelphia Regional Introduction of                     Minorities to Engineering) which are being expanded with Center                 support. Other similar summer programs for students are being                   supported at colleges and universities in the region.                                                                                                           At the college level, research experiences, internships, scholarship            support, mentoring, tutoring and minority student support groups, and           career awareness are being implemented.                                                                                                                         This project is an excellent example of a Comprehensive Regional                Center for Minorities. It is targeted at a minority population of               substantial size , and it is comprehensive in terms of attention to             the various educational levels and age groups, in disciplinary                  coverage, in coordination and cooperation among school systems,                 colleges and universities and community organizations, and in its               focus on nurturing, encouraging and motivating minority students.               Significant additional financial support is being contributed to the            project by the participating organizations and groups.",
