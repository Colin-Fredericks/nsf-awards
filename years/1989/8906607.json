 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research elucidates adaptive responses in two similar but                  different systems.  The first is the adaptation to sensory                      signals seen in bacterial chemotaxis, involving the aspartate                   receptor.  The covalent modification of this receptor is being                  studied both by a combination of genetic engineering to modify                  the receptor and study its dynamic state, and by x-ray                          crystallographic techniques which are designed to understand the                detailed protein structure.  In addition, the feedback from the                 cytoplasmic constituents of the cellular system are explored in                 an attempt to understand the quantitative contribution of the                   cytoplasmic components relative to the contributions of the                     internal protein structure.                                                                                                                                     The second adaptive system is the branch point operating at the                 isocitric dehydrogenase--isocitrate lyase position in Escherichia               coli, which allows the bacteria to adapt to growth on varying                   levels of acetate, and other constituents.  Studies focus on                    mutants of isocitric dehydrogenase and on recombinant DNA                       procedures which allow manipulation of the steps in the pathway                 in order to understand principles of regulatory control.  The x-                ray structure of the isocitric dehydrogenase will be determined                 to understand the role of mutants and the role of the induced                   conformational change in controlling the activity of the protein.                                                                                               Studies combining protein chemistry, enzyme kinetics and feedback               control are leading to an understanding of adaptive behavior in                 model systems.  Protein structure has been shown to be crucial                  for adaptation in microorganisms.  This project is providing                    information on molecular mechanisms of adaptive responses.",
