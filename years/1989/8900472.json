 "awd_abstract_narration": "A REU Site program is established involving eight student                       participants.  The program has both the summer and academic year                components.  At least three of the eight participants will be                   selected for summer participation from smaller regional colleges                with limited research activity.  A particular focus of                          recruitment efforts is to attract participants from women,                      minority and disabled student groups from within and without the                university.                                                                     Six faculty members will supervise the research efforts of the                  REU participants.  The areas in which the faculty members are                   actively engaged in research span experimental and computational                fluid mechanics, gas dynamics, heat transfer, helicopter                        aerodynamics and aeroelastic stability, aeroacoustics, noise                    control, automotive engineering, paper technology and robotics.                 A REU participant may select research problem in any one of these               research areas of interest to him.  Typical research problems                   are: (1) modelling of two dimensional jets, (2) computational                   fluid dynamics on parallel-architecture computers, (3)                          experimental unsteady heat transfer, (4) aeroelastic stability of               bearingless rotor blades, (5) micromechanics modelling of short                 fiber composites, and (6) organized structures in interacting                   coaxial supersonic jets.",
