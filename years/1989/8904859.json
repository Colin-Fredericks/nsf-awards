A computerized                 literature search will be used to identify econometric and other                projection studies of science/engineering labor markets.  The                   project will assess the accuracy of past projections, reasons for               error, how projections have varied and why, and lessons for                     future model building.  Accounts will be given by field, degree,                race/ethnicity, gender, and handicapped status to the extent that               these have been taken up in earlier studies and that subsequent                 data for evaluation exist.                                                           This is the third of a series of structured literature                     reviews and assessments planned by the Employment Studies Group                 to provide a comprehensive assessment of what existing evidence                 says about the various factors that determine the supply and                    demand of scientists and engineers.  Results will improve                       understanding of the science and engineering labor market                       pipeline and operation, identify gaps in evidence, and inform                   further research relevant to science and engineering personnel                  decision-makers.",
