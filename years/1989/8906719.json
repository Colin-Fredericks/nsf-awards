 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earthworms are important constituents of most terrestrial                  ecosystems and have a major influence on soil structure and                     organic matter decomposition processes.  This proposal uses a                   major historical event to focus on earthworms at the interface                  of ecology and biogeography.  Differential post-glacial northward               dispersal is hypothesized to have caused variation in earthworm                 community structure from south to north.  A hierarchical approach               is used to define hypotheses relating dispersal to landscape                    features, reproductive biology, and ecological factors.  Modern                 climatic limitation of species ranges, competitive displacement                 by exotic species, and interactive structuring of communities are               proposed as alternatives.  A program of collecting on four south                to north transects from glacial refugia across Wisconsinan                      glacial margins and on elevational transects south of the margins               will obtain data on earthworm community structures, long-term                   estimates of dispersal rates, and the influence of geographic                   barriers on dispersal of different ecological categories of                     earthworms.  Experiments measuring short-term dispersal rates and               testing the possibility of uniparental reproduction and                         alternative models are proposed.  A biogeographic and taxonomic                 data base will be created.",
