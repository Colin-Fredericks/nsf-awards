 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large numbers of students take mathematics courses in high school               yet leave high school without an understanding of how mathematics               is affecting their lives (e.g., CAT scans, compact disc                         recorders, cryptological protection of banking transactions,                    etc.)  Mathematics is too frequently taught in a void, outside of               any personal or historical context.  Fortunately, new development               in mathematics and mathematics education provide an opportunity                 to make constructive changes in the content and context of how                  mathematics is taught in high school  This approach involves                    stressing applications of mathematics at all stages of the                      curriculum, and emphasizing a historical approach to see how                    mathematical concepts and applications evolved.  Exciting and                   important examples abound:  Euler's work on graph theory laid the               foundations for modern applications to operations research,                     spurred by the exigencies of World War II; the work of Malthus                  and Volterra on population growth led to mathematical models now                being applied to critical environmental and ecological problems.                                                                                                The primary goal of this project is the development of a series                 of student-ready modules that use a historical framework to study               a variety of recent significant areas of applicability                          (optimization, voting, growth, cryptology, etc.).  Over the grant               period, the COMAP staff will produce six modules in both student                and teacher versions and a fifteen-minute video segment.  COMAP                 will dedicate its efforts, through its network of over 20,000                   high school mathematics teachers, to ensure widespread                          dissemination of the materials.",
