 "awd_abstract_narration": "Instrumentation involves three actions:  sensing, measuring, and                control.  The goal is to teach students that instruments are tools to           solve or study a given problem rather than just review the actions of           several unrelated instruments.  Students should learn the basic                 engineering principles used by the instruments.  Further, they should           use these instruments to obtain information necessary for design,               managing a process, or understanding basic material properties; thus            utilizing the three main actions of instruments.  Instrumentation               equipment to be acquired includes:  breadboard and scope, programmable          and frequency controllers, dynamometer, infrared thermometer, solar             radiometer, sensing units, chilled hygrometer, viscometer,                      permeability unit, and sieve pan set.  These instruments will be used           in our instrumentation class, and each will be used in our engineering          science and design classes to reinforce the student's understanding of          instrumentation.  This process will permit students to better                   understand the real world constraints of response time, cost,                   reliability, and quality of measurements.",
