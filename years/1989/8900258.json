 "awd_abstract_narration": "Participants of space and antarctic missions endure common                      stresses including isolation, confinement, and forced                           socialization, and may suffer biological alterations.  A more                   precise formulation of the interplay of such stresses on human                  well-being is needed.  The Polar Research Board's ad hoc Committee              on Antarctic and Space Life Sciences will conduct an assessment of              antarctic and space life sciences, identifying                                  top-priority research needs and highlighting collaborative                      projects.                                                                                                                                                       The committee will survey existing research by holding a workshop               to bring together antarctic and space life scientists.  A slate of              promising research questions will be developed.  Participation by               space and antarctic program managers will be sought to help                     identify infrastructure requirements and environmental restraints               and to further refine the developing research agenda.  A report                 identifying priorities for antarctic/space life science research                will be written.  This report is to include a summary of existing               research priorities addresses in discussion of techniques and                   infrastructure requirements needed to meet the proposed objects.",
