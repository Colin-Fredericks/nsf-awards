This award is                 designed to result in a fully developed proposal to be submitted                to the NSF at the end of the Planning Grant period.                                 The implementation of computerized information technologies                 poses major challenges to organizations.  Although offering                     substantial long-term benefits, the implementation of these                     technologies may alter familiar production processes and threaten               established organizational hierarchies, power bases, social                     norms, communication patterns, job characteristics, and  career                 paths.  An organization's ability to manage these challenges may                determine the ultimate outcomes of technology implementation:                   (1)the extent to which the new technology is used; (2)the gains                 in organizational performance attributable to the new technology;               and (3)the level of employee satisfaction with the new technology               and with the organization as a whole.  The proposed research is                 designed to assess the organizational determinants of these                     outcomes.  The research develops a model of implementation                      problems and determinants of successful outcomes, develops a                    cross-sectional survey research design and develops appropriate                 measures for the model's variables.",
