 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the Spring and Summer months, mesoscale convective systems           account for most beneficial rainfall as well as economically                    disruptive and life-threatening phenomena such as tornadoes, hail,              flash floods and high winds.  Mesoscale convective systems are                  collections of thunderstorms that cover areas several hundreds of               kilometers in typical dimension and have lifetimes of more than one             day.                                                                                The Principal Investigator proposes a joint observational                   analysis and numerical simulation approach in furthering knowledge of           mesoscale convective systems.  Observational data to be used are                those that have been collected during previous experiments sponsored            by the National Science Foundation.                                                 Among the research goals are:                                                   1. Analysis and simulation of mesoscale convective systems which            exhibit random patterns of thunderstorms.  The objective is to                  determine why some of these systems develop these random                        precipitation patterns while others exhibit a line structure.                       2. Use radar reflectivity fields to identify pulsations in                  volumetric rainfall rates and other morphological characteristics of            mesoscale convective systems over their lifetimes.                                  3. It has been noted that some mesoscale convective systems tend            to produce severe wind storms with most of the damage occurring on              the north side of synoptic-scale warm fronts.  The Principal                    Investigator will use a combination of numerical simulation and                 observational analyses to determine what combination of convective-             scale and meso/synoptic scale features lead to severe winds.                        4. Using advanced numerical techniques, the Principal                       Investigator will investigate the dynamical interactions between the            synoptic, meso-alpha and meso-beta scale.",
