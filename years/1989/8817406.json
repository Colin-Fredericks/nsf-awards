 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cosmogenic  He in surface rocks is produced in situ by cosmic ray               induced spallation reactions.  As shown by recent studies of radiocarbon        dated lava flows, measurements of cosmogenic helium can therefore be            used to determine exposure ages.  This research will apply the technique        to glacial deposits in the Antarctic Dry Valleys.  The goal of the              research is to resolve some existing questions regarding the helium             exposure-age method, and also to constrain the history of the Antarctic         ice sheet and its relation to global climate.  The Dry Valleys are ideal        to test the technique because of uniquely exposed, well-dated moraines          (Arena valley) indicate that quartz is a suitable mineral phase.  The           initial emphasis of the research will center on further measurements            from dated moraines, and gaining a better understanding of the                  distribution and retention of helium within quartz.  Quartz is such a           ubiquitous mineral that this will be of general interest to glacial             geology.  Application of the technique to glacial deposits in the Ross          Sea and glacially straited surfaces in the Transantarctic mountains will        help elucidate the history of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.",
