 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well documented that rhizobial purine auxotrophs are                      incapable of eliciting complete nodule development and symbiotic                nitrogen fixation. Recent work in Dr. Noel's laboratory suggests                that the underlying cause of the symbiotic defect is inability to               produce ribosyl-5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR), an                      intermediate in the pathway. The outlined project is to                         substantiate further the original observations, to test the                     hypothesis that AICAR is an infection-thread determinant, and to                define this role more clearly. The experiments probe the uptake                 and fate of AICAR in the bacteria and the possibility that AICAR                affects the plant directly. They will document the AICAR                        stimulated enhancement of nodule development by microscopic                     analysis of anatomy and electrophoretic analysis of proteins. The               effect of host roots and root exudate on bacterial purine and                   AICAR metabolism will be analyzed, mainly by tracer experiments                 in which labelled compounds are separated by a versatile thin-                  layer chromatography technique of great resolving power.                        Metabolic changes in the infectible region of the root will be                  analyzed after challenging the plant with the most likely                       bacterial mediator of the AICAR effect.                                         %%%                                                                             The establishment of the symbiotic association between nitrogen                 fixing bacteria and the roots of legumes is extremely important                 to agriculture. It is also of interest for an understanding of                  how signals are passed from one organism to another.",
