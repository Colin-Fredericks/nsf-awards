 "awd_abstract_narration": "The coordinate expression of genes whose products act jointly                   in a biochemical pathway is a focal point of regulatory                         biology in many organisms.  The objective of the proposed                       research is to characterize cis- and trans-acting factors that                  control the transcriptional expression of several genes in the                  biosynthetic pathway for anthocyanin pigments in maize.                         Anthocyanin synthesis requires the products of both structural                  and regulatory genes.  The results of genetic and molecular                     analyses implicate two of the regulatory genes, C1 (Colored                     aleurone-1) and Pl (Purple plant) as positive trans-activators                  that perform analogous regulatory functions in distinct tissues                 to control pigmentationin the kernel and the plant,                             respectively.  This proposal is aimed at evaluating the                         molecular interactions between C1 or P1 and the genes whose                     transcription they control.  Nuclear extracts from maize                        tissues will be used in DNase I footprinting experiments to                     identify cis-acting elements in cloned target genes.  Both in                   vitro and in vivo assays will be performed to determine if the                  C1 and P1 gene products are capable of specifically binding                     target elements and/or activating transcription.  Molecular                     genetic approaches will be used to explore the regulation of C1                 and P1 themselves with the goal of identifying other factors                    that mediate the tissue-specific expression of these regulatory                 genes.                                                                                                                                                          The pathway for anthocyanin biosynthesis in maize has been the                  focus of many of the extensive genetic studies in corn,                         primariy because of the ease of detecting color mutants.  This                  study will deepen our insight into how genes encoding                           structural protein are regulated in their expression in plants.",
