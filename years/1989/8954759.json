 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study will investigate the quality, validity,                 and significance of text-embedded and high-stakes science and                   mathematics tests and accompanying test preparation materials,                  as well as their impact on instruction and learning. The study                  will document the degree to which the relatively hidden text-                   embedded assessments, typically produced by textbook publishers                 to supplement textbooks, as well as state-mandated and national                 standardized tests and test preparation materials affect what                   is taught, how it is taught, what is learned, how it is learned                 in science and mathematics across the county. Particular                        emphasis will be given to the extent to which the form of                       questions in these assessments influence student thinking in                    favor of facts and recall over higher order thinking processes.                 The study will focus on the effects of standardized test use on                 learning in large school districts, with a specific focus on                    underprivileged, minority, and special needs students, and on                   the potential effects of test use on differences in science and                 mathematics learning of boys and girls. The research will also                  examine relative congruence of these tests and test-related                     materials vis-a-vis current efforts to deepen and broaden                       science and mathematics curricula in order to develop problem                   posing, exploratory, and analytical attitudes.                                       $60,000 in direct cost sharing equals 7% of the NSF                        award.",
