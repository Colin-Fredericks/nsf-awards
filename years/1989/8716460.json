 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern Ocean waters are famous for their high phytoplankton                   productivities.  However, those familiar with the Southern Ocean know           that the high productivity is generally confined to shallow shelf areas         and to waters along the ice edge; in comparison, little productivity            occurs offshore even though the waters contain massive amounts of major         plant nutrients.  One possible explanation for this finding is that an          essential trace element or organic nutrient is missing.  Although               evidence supporting this idea has been sought for the past 60 years,            rigorous testing was not possible before the recent development of              ultra-clean techniques which avoid trace-metal contamination.  Martin           has evidence which suggests that iron is the limiting trace element.  In        order to test the theory that the presence or absence of iron is                responsible for variations in Antarctic marine phytoplankton                    productivity, Martin proposes to measure iron concentrations in                 nearshore and offshore Southern Ocean waters and in ice samples using           ultra-clean techniques.  Ultraclean phytoplankton iron-enrichment               experiments will also be performed.  Testing the iron-deficiency                hypothesis is important because the Antarctic ecosystem will never be           adequately understood without knowing the reason(s) why major nutrients         are not used by phytoplankton.  The use or non-use of these major               nutrients plays a significant role in determining global atmospheric            carbon dioxide levels.",
