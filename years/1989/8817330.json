 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptive radiation, the process by which species diversify                 to fill different ecological roles, is a central phenomenon in                  the evolution of biological diversity.  Among bird families, the                radiation of hummingbirds is exceptional in scope (over 320                     species) and in the detail with which the adaptive significance                 of many anatomical features and behaviors have been studied.  Our               understanding of their radiation is hampered, however, because                  relationships among these birds are poorly understood;                          hummingbirds lack a fossil record and unrelated species may                     converge in anatomical traits characters because of similar                     nectarfeeding habits.  Drs. Bleiweiss and Kirsch will examine the               evolutionary relationships of hummingbirds by comparing directly                their genetic material using the technique of DNA/DNA                           hybridization.  With these data they will elucidate the                         interrelationships among many hummingbird genera, and determine                 which bird group is the family's closest relative.  Using this                  information Drs. Bleiweiss and Kirsch will conduct several                      natural experiments that will test how DNA evolves.  Hummingbirds               are well-suited for such experiments because they represent the                 extreme among birds in several features presumed to affect rates                of genetic change.  The study will provide an important framework               for understanding several basic evolutionary mechanisms                         associated with adaptive radiations.  //",
