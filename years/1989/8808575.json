 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Stein is examining the development of fundamental                     concepts of physics, with a view both to the clarification of                   general philosophical questions concerning scientific theories,                 and to promote understanding of the origins and the content of                  basic notions and principles of physics.  This study is the first               of a series of such studies in this area to be undertaken by the                principal investigator.  This part of the series will treat not                 the chronologically earliest period envisaged, but the central                  one:  roughly the period in which the basic concepts of modern                  mechanics and the theory of gravitation were created and the                    beginnings of physical optics were elaborated.  These conceptual                developments in modern physics coincided with the emergence of a                \"new philosophy\" of nature, variously represented by the work of                Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Huygens, Newton, Leibniz, Locke and                 others.  Besides this central period of interest in which he                    examines the fundamental concepts of mechanics, gravitation and                 optics, Professor Stein will also be examining earlier materials                on the development of astronomical theories and the later                       transformations of classical physics by the theories of                         relativity and quantum mechanics.",
