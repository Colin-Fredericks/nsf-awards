 "awd_abstract_narration": "They propose in this project to carry out theoretical studies of                strongly correlated quantum systems.  The properties of such                    systems are drastically altered as a result of interactions among               the constituents (spins or electrons in their case).  The                       importance of correlations in a system can be enhanced in several               ways:  by the application of a strong magnetic field, by reducing               the dimensionality of the system or by increasing the strength of               interactions between these constituents.  They propose here to                  study the three-dimensional-electron-gas in a strong magnetic                   field, using knowledge gained through the development of the                    theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE).  The same                  knowledge can be used with advantage in applying a class of                     variational wave functions to study the properties of the one-                  dimensional electron gas.  They propose also to continue their                  studies of the two-dimensional electron gas in a strong magnetic                field.  Additionally, the recently discovered copper oxide                      layered superconductors are believed to be strongly correlated                  systems because of the extremely strong Coulomb interactions                    between electrons on the same copper site.  These interactions                  may be responsible for their high-temperature superconductivity                 and they propose studies aimed at understanding the dependence of               their properties on the interaction strength.",
