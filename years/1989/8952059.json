 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the enhancement and development of the computer             graphics component of the computer science and engineering curriculum           and provides the resources for the interdisciplinary interaction of             computer science and the visual communications with the sciences for            scientific visualization.  The equipment includes graphics workstations         for the development of visualization software and display of                    scientific-oriented imagery, input devices for digitizing 3-D models            and images, and output devices for recording and disseminating results.         The primary goal of this project is to use the tools of scientific              visualization in the science curricula.  This is done using an                  interdisciplinary approach including computer science for development           of the graphics software, visual communications for composition and             presentation, and physics, chemistry, mathematics, forestry, geography,         geology, and biology for development of the problems.  The College is           also developing a program in visual communication skills which takes            advantage of the visual skills of the Native American students.  These          special efforts may help retain and graduate more Native American               students.  These special efforts may help retain and graduate more              Native American students.  The institution is providing matching funds          in an amount equal to or greater than the funds provided by the                 Foundation.",
