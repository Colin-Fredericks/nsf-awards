 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will measure the seasonality of foraminiferal                       production at high latitudes.  The samples will be collected in a               time-series of sediment traps in the North Atlantic and                         Norwegian-Greenland Sea near the present site of North Atlantic                 Deep Water formation.  A two year record of productivity and                    shell chemistry (stable isotopes) will be compared to real-time                 observations of surface water hydrography and chemistry in order                to calibrate the foraminiferal record of paleo-environmental                    conditions.                                                                     %%%                                                                             The shells of microscopic organisms in the northern North                       Atlantic and Norwegian-Greenland Seas will be collected with                    sediment traps for two years.  The chemistry of the water will be               measured during the same time period.  The results will allow the               researchers to calibrate the modern chemistry of these water with               the chemistry of foraminiferal shells which are preserved in the                geologic record.  This calibration is important because the study               area is the site of the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water;                 this water mass plays an importnat role in the climate history of               the earth.",
