 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is a continuation of long-term research on                   the causal mechanisms producing widespread loss and                             regeneration of temperate kelp forests.  In southern                            California, kelp forest regeneration usually involves the                       simultaneous colonization of several species of brown algae.                    The regenerative processes involving the microscopic recruit                    stages of these algae, however , are poorly understood.  This                   research will focus on the mechanisms promoting                                 simultaneous algal colonization.  The major areas of study will                 be  1) patterns and environmental causes                                        of spore release in three extremely morphologically distinct                    taxa of colonizing brown algae (the large kelps Macrocystis                     pyrifera and Pterygophora californica and much smaller                          filamentous brown algae), and  2) mechanisms promoting                          competition between these algae once spore settlement occurs.                   In the mature forest, algal assemblages are regulated largely                   by adult interactions.  Established patches or canopies can                     persist for many generations by resisting invasion from other                   species.  Consequently, following widespread forest loss,                       regenerative processes pertaining to spore availability and                     early competition may be of crucial importance because these                    processes can have long term consequences affecting the                         structure of the mature forest community.",
