 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last few years have seen increasing mutual awareness and               interaction between computer science and interactive decision                   theory (e.g., game theory, economics).  This has been spurred by                parallel developments in the two disciplines: in computer science,              the advent of distributed systems; in interactive decision theory,              the analysis of increasingly complex social systems, leading to                 the realization that traditional rationality assumptions make                   extremely large demands on the information processing capabilities              of the agents.  Computer scientists started using game-theoretic                and similar interactive models for the study of distributed                     computing systems and economists turned to computer science                     (finite automata, Turing machines, and actual computer programs)                to model bounded rationality. This project concentrates on three                central problems which arise in this connection: (1) Optimization               with limited memory-the study of the effect of limited capacity on              the optimization of rational agents.  The explicit modelling of                 the cost of information processing. (2) Common knowledge-to                     introduce the idea of \"formal common knowledge\" which would,                    practically speaking, achieve all the desirable coordination                    consequences that would be achieved under common knowledge. (3)                 Social interaction with bounded rationality-to formulate the                    presence of irrationality in social systems and define their                    equilibria. That is, the project initiates a serious study of the               behavior of interactive systems when some or all of the agents are              bounded rational.//",
