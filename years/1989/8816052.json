 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this investigation is to develop                  radiative transfer codes of stratocumulus and cumulus cloudiness                for climate models which are accurate in the solar spectrum to                  within 10 W m-2.  While the infrared spectrum also is important,                the emphasis in this investigation is on the solar spectrum.                    There are three components to this study:  1)  A more thorough                  analysis of 3D cloud field structure and microphysics.  For                     stratocumulus, the FIRE IFO database, as well as other sources,                 will be utilized.  The recent North Dakota (1987 and upcoming                   FAME, Hailswath II, COPS, and Hawaii Rainband data will be used                 for the cumulus studies.  2)  On the basis of aircraft                          microphysical observations and high spatial resolution satellite                imagery to determine cloud 3D structure, advanced broken cloud                  radiative transfer models will be developed.  The resulting                     radiative transfer predictions will be validated against                        satellite nadir radiance.  3)  Parameterization of the broken                   cloud radiative fluxes in terms of plane-parallel values will be                attempted.                                                                           This work will lead to improved representation of clouds in                climate models and thus enable more accurate treatment of cloud                 radiation interactions in climate change simulations.",
