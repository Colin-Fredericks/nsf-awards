 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator research program will                 be developed along three lines: investigation of the                            thermodynamics of polymer mixing, evaluation of the dynamics of                 polymer-polymer phase separation and block copolymer ordering,                  and establishment of a synthesis and characterization facility                  for the development of model materials.                                                                                                                              In the area of thermodynamics two classes of mixtures are of               principal interest:  binary polymer mixtures and block                          copolymers.  Research efforts will be directed at advancing our                 understanding of polymer segment interactions using model                       systems, and at correlating this knowledge with experimentally                  determined excess thermodynamics properties, phase diagrams, and                interfacial phenomena.  Such information will be obtained using                 neutron, x-ray and light scattering methods, along with electron                and optical microscopy techniques.                                                                                                                                   Two projects will be initiated in the dynamics category:                   spinodal decomposition, and nucleation and growth of binary                     polymer mixtures, and rheological characterization of order and                 disorder in block copolymers.  These investigations take                        advantage of our thermodynamic results in developing the                        appropriate phase diagrams with which to explore issues relating                to the dynamics of phase separation, and the properties of the                  resulting materials.  Isotopic polymer mixtures represent one                   example of an ideal model system which we will be using in study                -ing spinodal decomposition by light and neutron scattering.                    Investigation of block copolymers dynamics will rely mainly on                  the combined use of a mechanical spectrometer and small-angle x-                ray and neutron scattering.                                                                                                                                          Achieving these thermodynamics and dynamics goals depend                   upon the ability to manipulate the molecular weight,                            microstructure, isotopic constitution, and chain architecture of                model polymers.  This requirement will be met through the                       development of an anionic polymerization facility, augmented by a               catalytic hydrogenation and molecular characterization                          capability.  Thus, information regarding polymer thermodynamics                 and dynamics can be applied directly to materials optimization.",
