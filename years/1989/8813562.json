 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. David                Paul, University of Arkansas, and Professor Ingemar Lundstrom,                  Department of Physics and Measurement Technology, Linkoping                     University, Sweden.  The objectives of this research are to clarify             how the piezoelectric crystal (quartz crystal microbalance)                     functions as a sensor in the liquid phase.  In addition, the                    investigators will study how the microviscosity of the                          sensor/solution interface is affected by conformation changes in                large protein molecules next to the surface.  If the potentially                useful piezoelectric sensor is to be used to analyze important                  biological molecules, fundamental questions regarding protein                   interactions with the surface of the sensor must be answered.  It               is proposed that the interaction of \"simple\" proteins with the                  mechanically oscillating surface of the sensor can be completely                described with the data collected from combined ellipsometric and               electrochemical experiments.  This joint effort will bring together             Swedish expertise in ellipsometry with U.S. expertise in                        piezoelectric sensors to examine this question.                                                                                                                 The results of this research should provide new insights into the               use of piezoelectric crystals for sensors and add to the                        information on how solvents and proteins interact with metal                    surfaces.  Discovering which variables in the sensor                            surface/solution interface cause a frequency shift should be                    beneficial in applying the sensor to practical systems.  In                     addition, measurements from the piezoelectric sensor can also                   provide information on how the microviscosity of the liquid in                  contact with the protein is affected by conformational changes of               the protein.  This data may then be used to further develop                     practical applications of the piezoelectric sensor in the liquid                phase.  Potential applications are in the areas of biotechnology,               clinical analysis, and genetic engineering.",
