 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to investigate synchronization in              concurrent - perhaps distributed - algorithms.  Such algorithms involve         a number of independent tasks, or transactions, which synchronize with          one another periodically.  Unfortunately, synchronization impairs               performance since tasks must wait for one another.  Techniques for              improving performance by reducing synchronization will be investigated          and the structure of an asynchronous algorithm as it relates to                 synchronization will be modelled.                                                                                                                               A major cause for synchronization is the need for concurrent tasks to           access shared data.  Data is frequently characterized by integrity              constraints and it is generally required that these be true in all              states viewed by the tasks.                                                                                                                                     The research divides into three related problems.  The use of semantics         to remove the requirement that updates to shared data be performed              atomically will be investigated.  A strategy for decomposing updates            into smaller units which can be interleaved with the execution of other         tasks, hence reducing synchronization delays while maintaining                  integrity constraints is being studied.  The tradeoff between increased         concurrency and integrity constraint violation is under study.                  Relaxing synchronization to the extent of permitting violations but not         allowing the state of the data to deviate too far from one in which the         constraints hold is being studied.  Once again the emphasis is on               improving the performance of asynchronous algorithms which access               shared data.  Finally, the structure of an asynchronous algorithm as it         relates to synchronization will be studied to see whether algorithms            can be compared on the basis of the amount of synchronization involved.",
