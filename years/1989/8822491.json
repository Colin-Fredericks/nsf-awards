 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary relationships among organisms are central to                  research in the biological sciences.  Understanding the history                 of branching and divergence through the history of a group of                   organisms must precede an understanding of their function,                      ecology, geographic distribution, even their relevance for                      medical research.  Drs. Robert Sokal and F. James Rohlf have, for               the past three decades, pioneered the use of computers for                      reconstructing evolutionary relationships among organisms based                 on morphological and molecular data sets.  Several different                    approaches have been proposed for reconstructing phylogenies                    (e.g., maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, overall                           similarity).  Past work by Sokal and Rohlf has shown that under                 different circumstances, each of these alternate methods produces               the most accurate and stable reconstruction of a computer-                      generated branching history.  They now propose to develop new                   methods with which investigators can select the most appropriate                tool for analyzing real data, for which the underlying branching                history is unknown.                                                                  The methods and advice to be developed will have a wide                    audience, including systematists working on all organisms, and                  functional morphologists and biogeographers, for whom                           evolutionary relationships provide the framework for their                      research.",
