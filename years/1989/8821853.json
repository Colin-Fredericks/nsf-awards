The contractor will also provide for data            base management services in support of NSF and other personnel                  surveys as well as develop customized table generation procedures               for use on personal computers.                                                          The Foundation is responsible for developing and maintaining a          data base of demographic, educational, and employment information on            scientists and engineers.  This data base, the Scientific and                   Technical Personnel Data System, includes three surveys:  the                   National Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers, the             Survey of Natural and Social Science and Engineering Graduates, and             the Survey of Doctorate Recipients.  Results of the National Survey             of Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers and the Survey of                Natural and Social Science and Engineering Graduates are combined to            produce national estimates of the science and engineering population            in the United States.",
