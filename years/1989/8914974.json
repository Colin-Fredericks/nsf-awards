To attain this goal the Ana G.            Mendez Educational Foundation proposes to carry out a two day Regional          Proposal Writing Workshop for computer science and engineering faculty          of all major colleges and universities in Puerto Rico.  The Workshop            will be held June 29-30, 1989.  The workshop will be conducted by NSF           program representatives and AGMEF specialists.  It will focus on 1)             information on sources of funding within NSF, 2) developing plans for           CISE support programs 3) improving the understanding of participants of         the mechanics of proposal writing, and 4) developing proposal writing           and evaluation skills.  Eighty faculty from all major institutions will         participate.                                                                                                                                                    The project will be coordinated by the Office of the President of the           AGMEF.  An evaluation of the project will include a questionnaire and a         follow up survey to determine the number of proposals actually                  submitted to the Foundation.",
