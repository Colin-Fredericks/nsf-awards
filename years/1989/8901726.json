 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the work in this project represents continuing                     investigations into problems of mathematical analysis,                          generally  related to some particular application or physical                   model.  There  are four categories of study, the first                          concerned with singular  perturbations of nonconvex                             variational problems.  By this one  means locating functions                    which minimize an integral of some  nonconvex transformation                    of a class of functions.  Solutions are  generally not                          unique.  To single out more reasonable solutions,  singular                     perturbations are introduced to penalize the formation  of                      interfaces which occur among piecewise constant solutions.                      This adaptation of the problem leads to a form of \"preferred\"                   solutions which have been identified in certain cases.  There                   are many other important cases which have not been treated;                     two in particular are the cases where the unknown functions                     are gradients and the case where the unknowns are matrix-                       valued functions.                                                                    Additional work will be done on constrained reaction-                      diffusion processes, analyzing the front propagation of                         solutions to nonlinear parabolic equations.  The fronts                         typically represent phase boundaries and their velocity often                   depends on their local mean curvature such as occur in the                      motion of grain boundaries in metals.  The problem to be                        analyzed here is a gradient flow subject to a mass                              constraint.  The fronts will develop rapidly and then                           propagate with a curvature-dependent normal velocity.  The                      mass constraint will be inhibiting so that the actual form of                   the propagation rule remains to be established.                                      In a nonconvex problem arising in optimal design, one                      seeks to minimize the cost of material while maintaining the                    necessary strength.  Mathematically, the form of the                            minimization problems is that of a constrained least gradient                   problem.  A prescription for the construction of a solution                     has been given by Kohn and Strang for the two-dimensional                       case.  This work aims at developing a rigorous analysis of                      this method as well as looking for a means to analyze the                       question in higher dimensions.                                                       Work will also be done on branching phenomena of                           solitary waves.  In 1954, Friedrichs and Hyers established                      the existence of branch solutions of the water wave equation                    for sufficiently small speed and amplitude.  It has not been                    established whether or not secondary bifurcations of the                        first branches can occur.  The object of this study will be                     to show that this phenomenon is not possible and to establish                   conditions which guarantee the uniqueness of solutions having                   given amplitude or speed.",
