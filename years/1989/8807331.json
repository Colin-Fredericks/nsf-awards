 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project         between Dr. Joe Hightower of Rice University and Dr. L. Guczi of the            Hungarian Institute of Isotopes, Budapest, is to pursue catalyst                characterization in alkyne/alkadiene selective hydrogenation.  To do            this the researchers will study the effects of dispersion, support              additives and alloying on three fundamental surface reactions                   proceeding over palladium.  Joint efforts should yield detailed                 measurements useful in determining the most important catalyst                  parameters that influence catalyst selectivity.  Such reliable                  information about the basic chemical nature of active site and reaction         pathways could lead to eventual development of more selective and               longer lasting catalysts.                                                                                                                                       This project in catalytic kinetics fulfills the program objective of            advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and           pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                  competence.",
