 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an experimental study of the fluid mechanics of                    particle removal in turbulent boundary layer by suspension                      feeding bivalve mollusks.  The study is motivated by the need                   to obtain, for a variety of flow conditions, accurate estimates                 of the rate at which these animals remove phytoplankton biomass                 from the water column.  It is not clear at present how particle                 removal rates of a given population of bivalves should be                       related to pumping rates measured for single animals in                         laboratory experiments, or even particle removal rates measured                 for populations  under conditions different from those found in                 nature.                                                                              Stanford's School of Engineering will provide supplemental                 funds to facilitate the construction of the sophisticated                       flume.  Extensive measurements of velocity and concentration                    (solutes and particles) fields over \"model mollusks\" (various                   pumping arrangements) in the laboratory flume will be used to                   test two interrelated hypotheses:                                               (1) Near-bed hydrodynamics influence the flux of suspended                      particles (including phytoplankton) from the water column to                    filter-feeding bivalves, and thereby determine whether or not                   filter-feeding bivalves can control phytoplankton biomass in                    the overlying water column.  (2) Bivalve feeding currents                       modify flow properties near the bed, particularly rates of                      vertical mixing of particles, and thereby play a role in                        determining when benthic filter feeders can control                             phytoplankton populations.                                                           In order to assure the direct relevance of the proposed                    work to estuarine systems, the experimental program will be                     carried out in close collaboration with USGS scientistsV                        studying suspension-feeding bivalve mollusks resident in San                    Francisco Bay.",
