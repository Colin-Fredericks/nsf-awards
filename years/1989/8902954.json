The studies will                    feature the unique group of compounds in which metal cluster and                condensed cluster phases are stabilized by strongly bound,                      interstitial elements, but new examples of other structures,                    properties and bonding will also be sought.  The cluster host                   metals will include Sc, Y, the lanthanides, Ti, Hf and Nb, the                  halides will be chloride, bromide and iodide, and the                           interstitials studied will be both main group and transition (3d,               4d, 5d) elements.  In addition to complete structural                           characterization, physical properties of new and interesting                    phases will be defined by conductivity, magnetic susceptibility,                solid state NMR, and photoelectron spectroscopic measurements,                  and these will be coupled with extended-Huckel (band)                           calculations.  Particular emphasis will be given to both the                    range of interstitials possible and the nature of the bonding in                clusters centered by heavy transition elements, to the creation                 and properties of infinite chain and sheet structures in which                  these compounds provide heterometal arrays, to the relationship                 of these compounds to intermetallic phases, and to the solution                 chemistries of centered clusters as these provide both                          understanding of their stabilities and possible routes to new                   solid materials.",
