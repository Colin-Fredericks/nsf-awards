 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many animals generate both intra- and extracellular calcium                     granule complexes in one or more of their tissues.  Functions for               these granules include the buffering of pH changes, storage of                  calcium, and binding of heavy metals as a detoxification system.                Drs. Silverman and Dietz have found calcium phosphate based                     concretions located extracellularly in the connective tissues of                the gill in freshwater unionids, and these concretions can amount               to 50% of the gill dry weight.  The five species examined to date               demonstrate concretion mobilization during reproduction.  The PIs               have documented that during the mobilization of concretions,                    calcium is passed into the water channels of the gills and                      incorporated into the shells of developing embryos.  This                       strategy of maternal nutritive support of (technically externally               brooded) invertebrate larvae raises many questions of general                   interest.  Specifically, the present proposal is aimed at                       understanding the mechanisms of synthesis and mobilization of the               concretions and the mechanisms by which calcium is stored and                   then transferred to the embryos during shell formation.                         Elucidating the regulatory role of the concretion organic matrix,               the inorganic structure of the concretions, and the cells                       producing concretions will lead to a better understanding of                    intracellular biomineralization processes in general.                                                                                                           Calcium granules are produced in the gills of freshwater clams.                 These granules are composed of calcium and phosphate.  The cells                that produce the granules have been identified and are a good                   model system for intracellular mineralization processes.  Drs.                  Silverman and Dietz will study the organic components of the                    granules, the inorganic structure of the granules, and the cells                involved in mineralization.  The PIs will study the regulatory                  role of organic molecules on the mineralization process.                        Understanding the mechanisms of clam calcium granule formation                  may lead to a better understanding of the biological processes                  involved in formation of mineralized structures.",
