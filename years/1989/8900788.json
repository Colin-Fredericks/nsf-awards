 "awd_abstract_narration": "The undergraduate research program of the Department of                         Pharmacology, University of South Alabama, will provide research                experiences for ten undergraduates.  The focus of the program is                cellular signalling, e.g., how hormones, calcium, cyclic                        nucleotides, protein phosphorylation, and induction of specific                 intracellular proteins may influence cell function.                             Participating faculty have extramural research support and                      ongoing, active research programs.  Students will be provided a                 research experience in a laboratory selected by them on the basis               of summary descriptions and discussion with the investigator.  In               addition, students will receive a formal review of the general                  area of cellular signalling via an organized weekly course.                     Students will be recruited from regional undergraduate                          institutions that do not themselves provide formal research                     experiences for undergraduates.  Recruiting will be accomplished                through science counselors, mail brochures and campus visits.                   Students will be provided compensation and access to student                    facilities (e.g. library and athletic facilities, housing and                   meal services).",
