 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluorescence spectroscopy is one of the most valuable tools                     available for the study of the solution structure and dynamics of                                                                                               biomolecules and the thermodynamics and kinetics of interacting                 biochemical systems.  The emission of most biochemical systems is                                                                                               heterogeneous, however, and this complicates the interpretation                 of fluorescence data.  As a means to resolve these                              heterogeneously emitting systems we propose to implement the                    following strategy to enhance our ability to acquire and                        interpret steady state (intensity and anisotropy) fluorescence                  quenching (or enhancement) studies.  Specifically, we propose to                implement the following strategy to enhance our ability to                      acquire and interpret steady state (intensity and anisotropy)                   fluorescence quenching (or enhancement) studies.  Specifically,                 we propose  a) to develop computer software to perform nonlinear                least squares analysis of fluorescence data in a global manner                  (i.e., multiple wavelengths fitted simultaneously),  b) to                      interfere a photodiode  array fluorometer with a personal                       computer in order to conveniently acquire and store data for such                                                                                               a global analysis,  c) to employ a computer-controlled dispenser                                                                                                for the precise and rapid addition of quencher or other reagent,                                                                                                and  d) to apply this approach to several fluorescence quenching                                                                                                studies, primarily with proteins that contain two fluorescing                                                                                                   tryptophan residues.  This approach will be useful not only for                                                                                                 solute quenching studies, but also for ligand binding systems,                                                                                                  and for any system in which the fluorescence of a probe is                                                                                                      changed in response to the addition of a chemical agent, or to a                                                                                                change in temperature, pH, etc..",
