 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in                                     theoretical condensed matter physics to be conducted                            by Eduardo Fradkin of the University of Illinois at                             Urbana and Fidel Schaposnik of the University of La                             Plata in Argentina.  The study of Fermionic models in                           condensed matter physics and field theory is an                                 extremely active area of theoretical physics.  Here,                            path-integral methods will be used to study the Kondo                           effect, resonating valence band models of                                       superconductivity and antiferromagnetism and related                            field theoretical models.  These techniques will be                             used to understand the consequences of symmetries,                              anomalies and topology as well as currently proposed                            models for high-temperature superconductivity and                               related field theories.                                                                                                                                         The Physics Department at Illinois is one of the                                leading institutions in the U.S. in condensed matter                            physics, both theory and experiment.  The Laboratory                            for Theoretical Physics at the University of La Plata                           is internationally recognized for contributions to the                          study of anomalies in field theory.  These techniques                           are particularly useful in the field of                                         high-temperature superconductors.  The research                                 interests of the two groups are complementary and the                           continued collaboration will develop further exchanges                          and cooperation between scientists, post-docs and                               students.",
