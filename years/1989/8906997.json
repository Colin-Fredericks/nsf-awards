 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will investigate the factors regulating               the absconding (migration) behavior of the African honeybee in                  Botswana, Africa.  Absconding can result in an enormous loss of                 colonies, which (1) may negatively impact on U.S. beekeeping                    with the arrival of the African honeybee from South America, and                (2) continues to impede the development of commercial beekeeping                in many regions of Africa.  Honeybee migration often appears to                 occur in response to changing foraging conditions.  However, it                 is unclear exactly how food availability and colony food needs                  interact to determine a colony's decision to abandon an area.                   This study proposes to use field studies and experimental                       manipulations to explore if colonies abscond in response to (1)                 fluctuations in the average rate of food intake, (2) changes in                 the day-to-day variability in foraging success, or (3) some                     weather cue.                                                                         The proposed research has both scientific and economic                     merits.  Since absconding is an all-or-none response in which all               members of a colony depart simultaneously, it represents a group-               level decision to switch foraging patches.  Absconding therefore                provides a unique opportunity to explore the mechanisms                         underlying group decision-making processes, which remain some of                the least understood aspects of animal social behavior.                         Economically, the study will benefit beekeeping in both the U.S.                and Africa.  A better understanding of the factors regulating                   absconding may facilitate the incorporation of the African bee                  into U.S. beekeeping and agricultural practices.  In Botswana                   bees are abundant and honey brings a high price.  Yet, beekeeping               is undeveloped in much of the country, due in part to absconding,               which makes it difficult to maintain colonies for extended                      periods.  A greater knowledge of absconding may therefore help                  lay the groundwork for improving commercial beekeeping in                       Botswana.",
