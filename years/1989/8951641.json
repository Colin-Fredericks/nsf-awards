 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surface chemistry has become a very important analytical                   approach for the study of heterogeneous catalysts, semiconductors               and corroded surfaces.  Yet undergraduates receive very little                  introduction to the field in the classroom and none in the                      laboratory.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger                   electron spectroscopy (AES) are two complimentary surface                       techniques and are the most commonly used of the surface analysis               techniques.  Equipment has been purchased that is mounted onto an               existing vacuum system so that the system is configured for the                 large number of samples that are involved in student use.                       Students use this equipment in physical chemistry and                           instrumental analysis course to learn the strengths of each                     technique and see how they can use the two to determine the                     surface elemental composition and chemistry and to determine film               thickness.  The institution is matching the NSF grant with an                   equal amount of funds.",
