 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small infectious RNAs, such as satellites and viroids, can                      interfere with fundamental but as yet unidentified molecular                    processes in plant cells.  Much attention has been focused                      recently on the generation of mature forms of circular small                    infectious RNAs.  The discovery that some satellites and                        viroids undergo self-cleavage reactions while others only                       process in the presence of nuclear extracts is increasing our                   basic understanding of the multifunctional properties of RNA                    molecules.  To study the generation of linear satellite RNAs,                   the turnip crinkle virus satellite system is ideal because of                   the multiple related satellites, the infectivity of in vitro                    altered satellite and the recent identification of a region                     essential for normal monomeric satellite accumulation.  By in                   vitro alteration of the satellite sequence, followed by in                      vitro transcription of infectious cRNA and inoculation in                       plants, the nucleotides involved in satellite processing in                     this region as well as others will be precisely identified.  To                 better understand this potentially novel processing mechanism,                  sequences involved in processing will be duplicated, deleted                    and moved to different locations in the satellite molecule.  To                 aid in data analysis, an in vitro processing system will be                     developed using extracts from infected and uninfected plants.                                                                                                   The study of small pathogenic RNAs is a particularly                            challenging and intriguing area of plant biology.  Even though                  these RNAs can be described in molecular terms, their mode of                   action remains unsolved.  The fact that they can have                           significant effects on plant development suggests that these                    simple pathogenic RNAs must somehow interact and interfere with                 fundamental molecular mechanisms in the normal plant cell.",
