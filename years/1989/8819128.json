 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed toward elucidation of the means by                    which the five operons which comprise the sn-glycerol-3                         phosphate (glp) regulon in E. coli are coordinately but at the                  same time differentially controlled by the glp R. encoded                       repressor.  So for the DNA carrying the glpR genes has been                     cloned and characterized; the glp R encoded repressor has been                  purified and characterized, the nucleotide sequence of glp R                    gene has been determined and the operator sequences for each of                 the glp gene have been identified.  The structures of all the                   control regions for the glp operons will be defined and the                     binding affinity of the repressor for each operator will be                     determined.                                                                                                                                                     The results of this research will provide important information                 about factors influencing the interaction been specific                         proteins (GlpR.CRP.cRMP, Fnr and Arc A) and their recognition                   sites on DNA, and how these interactions are important for the                  regulation of gene expression. Such knowledge will provide                      information about how the cell uses specific DNA protein                        interactions to respond to changes not only in the exogenous                    supply of glycerol-P and its precursor but also the presence of                 alternative carbon sources and to the respiratory state of the                  cell as determined by the identity of the terminal electron                                                                                                     acceptor.",
