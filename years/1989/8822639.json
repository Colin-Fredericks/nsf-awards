 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is dedicated to the study of dynamic, electronic,                  and optical properties of simple systems at extreme pressures and               low temperatures.  The techniques used in the experiments are                   principally inelastic scattering of light.  In the recent past,                 most of the light scattering has been spontaneous Raman                         scattering.  More recently the laboratory added facilities to do                coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) and other four wave                mixing experiments.  Among these, two-photon resonances are being               exploited to probe electronic structure of samples within anvil                 cells.  A particular advantage of the multiphoton technique is                  the ability to examine electronic states having energies higher                 than the maximum photon energy at which high pressure windows,                  e.g. diamond, are transparent.  They propose to exploit this                    advantage in a program of study of electronic excited states in                 hydrogen and deuterium and in exygen, nitrogen, and benzene at                  extreme pressures.",
