 "awd_abstract_narration": "How long had the Indians inhabited North America prior to the                   coming of Columbus?  In the late 1850's, European researchers had               determined that human antiquity reached back to the Pleistocene                 era.  The hypothesis was then advanced that humans had, through                 parallel development, also inhabited North America through the                  same time span. Evidence was gathered in the 1880's to support                  this hypothesis.  Yet in 1890, this theory came under withering                 attack.  The dispute which continued until 1927 dissolved into a                complex, wide-ranging and frequently bitter argument that far                   eclipsed the archaeological issues at hand and profoundly                       affected the participants and the emerging discipline of                        archaeology.  Today, this dispute is little understood because                  the quarrel itself was never fully public.  Under this grant, Dr.               Meltzer will analyze the rich unpublished archives of disputants                whose roles up to now have been largely unexamined.  By examining               these archives and combining the information gleaned from these                 sources with his own previous archival research and ongoing                     analysis of published documents, Dr. Meltzer will produce the                   first comprehensive record of the controversy.  It will then be                 possible to understand how and why this controversy was created,                sustained, and ultimately resolved--questions which are now                     unanswerable for want of adequate documentation.  In turn, this                 will allow an evaluation of the internal \"scientific\" and                       external \"social\" accounts for this episode, and whether the two                sorts of accounts are separable.  This was a pivotal episode in                 North American archaeology, but the significance of its study                   even goes beyond the history of the field.  American archaeology                is again embroiled in controversy over human antiquity.  Looking                back will help pout in historical perspective the obstacles that                still bedevil the subject, and thereby close the gap between the                near and deeper past and between science and the history of                     science.",
