 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tobacco etch virus (TEV) is a member of the potato virus Y                      (potyvirus) group.  Potyviruses are frequently encountered                      pests and result in significant crop loss.  New sources of                      virus resistance are needed.  The work detailed in this                         proposal will identify the virus gene product(s) involved in                    viral RNA replication.  The plan makes use of a defined                         system to ask questions about the role played by the TEV                        polymerase during the template elongation reaction.  The                        polymerase gene will be expressed in heterologous cell                          systems and polymerase activity will be purified and assayed                    in a cell-free system using defined TEV templates.  Protein                     domains responsible for polymerase activity will be                             identified using immounological and molecular genetic                           approaches.  Monoclonal antibodies will be used to identify                     domains when bound by antibody, eliminate polymerase                            activity.  These regions become candidates for a molecular                      genetic analysis using site directed mutagenesis.  Likewise,                    an attempt will be made to construct hybrid polymerase                          molecules using gene segments from two closely related                          potyviruses.  Polymerase domains responsible for the                            template elongation reaction are proposed to be common                          between these two viruses should be interchangable.                             Successful completion of the plan should identify a virus                       specific product which can be targeted for disruption in the                    design of new resistance strategies.                                                                                                                            These studies are important, both in terms of their potential                   for eventual control of this enocomically important pest and                    as an resource extremely useful for comparitive studies of                      RNA replication factors.",
