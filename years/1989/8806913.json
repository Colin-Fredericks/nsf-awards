 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past several years, the mathematical objects known as               feature structures have been employed by numerous research                      traditions in theoretical and computational linguistics                         (collectively referred to as \"unification-based grammar\") for                   modeling a wide range of phenomena in the domain of natural                     language.  The principal investigator will explore the thesis that              the formalism of feature structures, appropriately extended, is                 capable of serving as the foundation for mathematically precise and             computationally tractable theories of natural language structure                that have determinate empirical consequences.  The researcher would             then apply such extensions to the formalization of explicit                     \"principle-based\" linguistic theories and to the construction of                practical NLP programs, focussing upon such centrally important                 linguistic phenomena as word order, binding, long-distance                      dependencies (\"A-bar movement\"), and discourse structure.                            Extensions to be investigated include, inter alia, the                     following:  (1) different varieties of negative constraints                     (classical negation, intuitionistic negation, and apartness);                   (2) different varieties of type regiments (via the logic, via                   structural constraints on graphs, via sorting of algebraic models)              and associated inheritance schemes (inclusion polymorphism);                    (3) realization of such notions as list value and set value                     (parametric polymorphism); (4) predicates other than equality (e.g.             inequality, append, subset, union) and \"building-in\" of equational              theories (generalized unification); (5) methods for introducing                 recursion; (6) infinitary methods (e.g. \"functional uncertainty);               and (7) dynamic interpretation.",
