Beall Fowler of Lehigh University and Prof. Noriaki Itoh of            Nagoya University, Japan.  Participants will meet in Nagoya September           11-14, 1989, to discuss the basic processes that occur as a result of           the electronic excitation of non-metallic solids through the                    interaction of electrons and photons.  These processes include defect           reactions, transformation from crystalline to amorphous structure               through defect formation, and surface phenomena including surface               reactions and desorption of atoms.                                                                                                                              Laser, X-ray, or even intense conventional light illumination can give          rise to the processes to be discussed at the seminar.  Japanese workers         have efforts under way to utilize such irradiation inthe processing of          materials such as semiconductors and metals, and U.S. researchers have          been active in constructing theories for the interactions at the atomic         level.  This seminar will bring both technologists and physical                 theorists together for discussions which could have important                   implications in the fields of commerical electron and photon devices,           and materials growth and treatment.",
