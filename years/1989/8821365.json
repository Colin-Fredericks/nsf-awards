 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth and decline of voluntary associations is a                           contemporary social issue of great concern; yet                                 understanding the reasons for the viability of such                             associations is a classic concern of sociological theory                        and research. This investigator proposes to replicate an                        earlier survey of voluntary associations and their                              memberships with significant extensions and improvements                        beyond earlier NSF funded data collection and analysis. He                      is viewed as one of the most creative and skilled                               sociologists in the field of complex organization. The                          present proposal is a rich blend of several theoretical                         perspectives on organizations, including ecological models                      of the competition among voluntary associations and of                          their growth and decline, and an attractive set of planned                      statistical analyses appropriate to the kind of data to be                      collected. The results should further the PIs own                               cumulative development of a dynamic theory of the growth                        and decline of voluntary associations.",
