 "awd_abstract_narration": "Appropriate use of the computers in the classroom with commercially             available programs improves the students understanding of mathematical          concepts by transforming complex equations into visual graphics and             numerical examples.  The presenters have been using this technology for         several years with great success.  A week long summer workshop is being         held in the summer of 1989 for other instructors from colleges and              universities in the Southeastern Region.  The presenters are                    describing how to install computers in the classroom and how to design          computer enhanced lessons.  It is anticipated that when the instructors         return home and the benefits of their techniques become clear, their            colleagues will also become involved in the implementation of the               computer bases approach.  An electronic mail bulletin board for                 Computer Based Mathematics Education is being established to share              information among workshop participants and other interested                    mathematicians.                                                                                                                                                 The colleges and universities of the participants are also                      contributing to the program through support of the faculty who will             attend.",
