 "awd_abstract_narration": "The translocation of CO2 and chloride ions through gills will be                studied using isolated perfused crab gills.  CO2 flux across the                gill is a process which can be complex due to several factors:                  1)  carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes the hydration and                       dehydration reactions of CO2, is located on the cell surface and                inside the cell;  2)  CO2 is generated endogenously by active                   metabolic processes; and  3)  CO2 hydrated to bicarbonate plays a               role in chloride uptake via C1-/HCO3-exchange.  The quantitative                importance and contribution of the above processes to the                       excretion of CO2 out of the animal and the uptake of chloride                   during low salinity stress is poorly understood.  This proposal                 outlines experiments testing hypotheses which will elucidate the                dual (CO2 and C1-) and related translocation processes.  This                   study, which has general relevance to ion uptake processes in any               metabolically active epithelium, is designed to determine the                   existence and location of C1-/HCO3-exchanger, determine the                     amount and the fate of the CO2 produced by the gill, measure the                quantitative contribution of endogenously produced CO2 to C1-                   /HCO3-exchange, and determine the quantitative function of cell                 surface and intracellular carbonic anhydrase in CO2 excretion and               chloride uptake.  The results have importance to our                            understanding of the interplay between acid balance, respiration                and ion regulation of aquatic animals in normal and polluted                    waters.",
