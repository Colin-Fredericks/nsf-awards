 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purchase of a high field, variable temperature Nuclear                 Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer has enhanced the undergraduate                  research and instruction at Southern Oregon State College.  With                beyond the study of simple proton spectra.  The instrument is                   incorporated into laboratory courses in Organic, Inorganic,                     Analytical, Biochemistry, and Advanced Organic to provide                       extensive opportunities for students to become familiar with the                operation of the instrument, interpret spectra, and understand                  the significance of FT-NMR to current chemical methodology.  The                undergraduate research program is greatly impacted by the                       extended capabilities of such an instrument.  Some of the                       projects affected are:  Cyclopropenes as Allene Synthons,                       Chromium and Manganese Complexes containing Diisocyanide Ligand                 Bridges, Asymmetric Epoxidation of Chiral Vinyl Silanes, and                    Structure Elucidation of Unusual Compounds from Lichens.  The                   institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of                   funds.",
