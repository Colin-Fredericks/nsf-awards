 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be carried out on the following:  1) Stokes' theorem              will be extended to topological manifolds.  Dr. Harrison has already            shown that Green's theorem is valid for 1-forms on fractal curves in            the plane, as long as the 1-form is sufficiently smooth compared to             the dimension of the curve.  She will extend her methods into higher            dimensions.  If Dr. Harrison is able to extend Stokes' theorem to               fractal manifolds, wide-ranging applications in physics, biology,               chemistry, and many other fields are anticipated.  2) Preliminary               estimates show that the dimension of an infinite minimal set of a               diffeomorphism f of the circle is necessarily greater than or equal to          the degree of differentiability of f minus one.  Attainment of that             result will imply the classic result of Denjoy - all twice                      differentiable diffeomorphisms of the circle with no periodic points            can only have the whole circle as a minimal set.  3) The loxodromic             mapping problem.  A simple dynamical question on the sphere will lead           to significant progress on the Seifert Conjecture.  Dr. Harrison hopes          to show that the answer involves deep relations between Hausdorff               dimension of an invariant set and the differentiability class of the            homeomorphism.                                                                                                                                                  Interactive activities include giving a formal lecture to the                   undergraduates on fractals in mathematics, organizing a weekly seminar          on global analysis with graduate student participation, holding                 monthly workshops with women mathematicians lecturing about their               work, and arranging discussion sessions on the problems women face as           professional mathematicians and how to deal with them.  In addition,            Dr. Harrison will give one or two seminars on her research to the               mathematics department.                                                                                                                                         This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and  (2) to encourage               women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing                 greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in               industry, government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the            participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
