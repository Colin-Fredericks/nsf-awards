 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solid-oixide electrolytes offer the prospect of conducting                      electrochemistry at high temperatures and in reactive environments;             one present application is for monitoring oxygen levels in combustion           exhaust streams.  Existing systems use porous metallic films deposited          on solid electrolytes; while functional, such systems have low                  effeciency, apparently because only the three-phase (metal,                     electrolyte, gas) boundary is active.  This study seeks to overcome             this problem by use of metal oxides that exhibit conductivity for both          electrons and oxygen ions.  Specifically, the kinetics of oxygen                exchange between the gas phase and a family of electrolytes with the            perovskite structure, lanthanum-doped calcium manganate                         (LaxCa1-xMn03), is investigated.  Electronic and ionic properties can           be varied by changing the doping level. Techniques for preparing these          materials in useful forms will be perfected. Electrochemical kinetics           are measured using steady-state and transient electrochemical                   techniques; conductivities are measured using AC impedance methods;             and surface chemistry is probed using temperature-programmed                    desorption and Auger election spectroscopy.                                                                                                                     This study could have very wide impact.  The most immediate impact              will be in systems using oxygen sensors including control systems for           automotive carburetion and exhaust control, and for                             incineration.  This work should reduce the size, extend the                     useful temperature range, and improve the sensitivity of these                  sensors.  Similar electrodes should be useful in fuel cells,                    electrolyzers, and other electrochemical devices.  The work is                  also applicable to other high-performance ceramics, notably the                 closely related \"defect perovskite superconductors.\"",
