 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program of research and development uses intelligent microworlds to        teach fundamental concepts of number and operation to elementary and            middle school children.  The work will examine innovative ways of               incorporating computers into conceptully oriented mathematics                   instruction.  The following questions will be addressed:  (a) how               computers can support human interaction instead of replacing it; (b) how        discussion of mathematical ideas ay enhance conceptual lerning; (c) how         graphical and symbolic representations scaffold discussion; and (d) how         intelligent miroworlds facilitate problem solving and mathematics               understanding by providing visible representations of mathematizable            situations and connecting them to abstractions.                                                                                                                 An integrated system of computer microworlds will be developed.  These          microworlds will represent abstract mathematical concepts in a directly         manipulable graphical form, permitting display and exploration of a             range of basic number concepts taught in elementary and middle schools.         The system will include distinct representations for the different              senses of arithmetic operators, along with facilities for linking these         sense-specific representations to more abstract graphic and symbolic            representations of equations.  The system will be used to scaffold both         teacher-led discussion of mathematics concepts, and independent                 mathematics work by children.",
