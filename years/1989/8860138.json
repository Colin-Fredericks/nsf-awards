 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective is to develop a lightweight, adjustable,                          maintenance-free as well as economical structural system for use                in the construction industry.  To be studied is a prestressed                   structural system of kevlar 49 and E-glass polyester resin, which               have excellent corrosion resistance as well as being lightweight.                                                                                               The objective of the research will focus on the time-dependent                  characteristics of the beam elements of the proposed system and                 the feasibility of developing a computer model which can predict                the behavior of these elements.  The Phase I effort will involve                an investigation into 3 major areas; materials, geometry, and                   construction.  The time-dependent studies will involve full-scale               testing of the proposed beam elements at the Center for Advanced                Technology for Large Structural Systems (ATLSS) under Dr. John W.               Fisher, Director, at Lehigh University.  Phase II will involve                  full-scale dynamic tests at the ATLASS Center.",
