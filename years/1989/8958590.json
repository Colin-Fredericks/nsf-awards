 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the properties of a new semantics for             (possibly) unstratified logic programs and knowledge bases, called the          well-founded semantics.  Certain concepts have a natural expression             using \"unstratified\" rules in a knowledge base, but have no formulation         using \"stratified\" rules.  The recently formulated well-founded                 semantics is defined for both \"stratified\" and \"unstratified\" logic             programs and knowledge bases.                                                                                                                                   Initially, the investigation will address theoretical issues that have          a bearing on the usability and implementability of the semantics.               These issues include the relative expressive power of the semantics,            algorithms for recognizing programs (sets of rules) that can be                 implemented \"efficiently\", and algorithms for executing such programs,          particularly over unstratified knowledge bases.  The latter part of the         project will begin implementation of prototype analyzers and                    translators, based on algorithms developed in the beginning of the              project.                                                                                                                                                        Additional goals of the project will be to develop useful guidelines            for logic program design and knowledge base design that ensure that all         valid queries have a well-defined answer in the well-founded semantics,         to explore extensions to the rule language to allow guards and set              formation, and to study related issues of parallel computation.",
