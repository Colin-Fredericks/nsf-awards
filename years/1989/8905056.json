 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marble Canyon intrusions, located near Van Horn, Texas                 is surrounded by a contact aureole in which sanidinite facies                   assemblages occur.  Preliminary phase equilibrium calculations                  suggest that unusually high temperatures (925 - 1025 C) were                    reached near the contact.  Heat flow considerations suggest,                    however, that this temperature is too high for a contact aureole                given reasonable assumptions about the geometry of the intrusion.               A research program is outlined that will carefully examine the                  geochemistry of the Marble Canyon aureole, quantitatively                       evaluate the thermal aureole and the nature of the fluid and                    attempt to explain this apparent discrepancy.                                        The Marble Canyon aureole contains a large number of mineral               species (Table 1), and thus is especially conducive to a study of               contact metamorphism at high temperatures.  The study proposed                  here will combine petrological and geochemical approaches to                    yield a combined understanding of the processes which form high                 temperature contact aureoles in general, and the Marble Canyon                  aureole in particular.  Data will allow a quantitative evaluation               of temperature and fluid compositions changes, metasomatism and                 reaction progress with increasing distance from the intrusion.                  Geochemical studies will concentrate on C/O stable isotopic                     variations and bulk chemical evaluation of changes in major and                 trace elements with distance from the intrusion.  Similar data                  obtained from different sources (e.g. temperatures from thermal                 modelling and phase equilibria and fluid/rock ratios from                       reaction progress and isotopic calculations) will be examined for               internal consistency, and any observed differences will be                      evaluated in terms of the data bases, assumptions, and real                     errors involved.  Particular attention will be given to the                     possibility that the concept of fluid/rock ratios may itself be                 erroneous and that alternative descriptions of the interactions                 between metamorphic fluids and rocks are needed.",
