 "awd_abstract_narration": "During fruiting body formation in myxococcus xanthus, dramatic                  changes occur in gene expression.  We plan to analyze several                   developmentally regulated genes in order to learn how these                     changes are regulated.  1) The mbhA gene encodes a lectin which                 appears during aggregation.  The promoter for this gene resembles               the nitrogen regulated promoters from E. coli.  We plan to use                  site-directed mutagenesis to characterize this promoter.  We also               plan to locate the upstream enhancer sequences, previously                      identified, and search for proteins which recognize it.  We will                use the Salmonella ntrA gene to clone and sequence the Myxococcus               NTRA-like sigma factor.  We also plan to examine why the mbhA                   mRNA has such a long half-life, 2 hrs.  2) frz genes are                        homologous to Salmonella chemotaxis gene.  They are                             developmentally induced, but not an operon.  The role of frzCD in               stimulating the other frz genes will be studied since it contains               a DNA-binding domain similar to sigma-43.  Missense mutations in                this domain will be isolated.  Fusion proteins will be purified                 and assayed for DNA-binding activity.  We will also identify the                transcripts and promoters of the frz genes.  3) Alkaline                        phosphatase is induced at late times of development                             (sporulation).  We will clone and sequence the gene.  The cloned                gene will be used to study late gene expression.",
