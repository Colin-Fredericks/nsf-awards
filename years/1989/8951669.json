 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Neurobiology laboratory course will be divided into two semesters.          New equipment, including inverted microscopes, specialized amplifiers,          and personal computers with interface boards that can accept signals            from nerve cells will permit students to do four new kinds of                   experiments that they are not able to do at the present time:  1.               using enzymes to trace anatomical pathways; 2.  studying nerve cells in         culture; 3.  analyzing single ion channels in nerve membrances; and 4.          working with computer models of nerve cells and neural networks.                These new instruments will show more directly than older techniques how         nerve cells and nervous systems work, and will allow the students to be         engaged in the kind of activity that is going on now in the exciting            field of neuroscience.                                                                                                                                          The college will provide 50% matching funds.",
