 "awd_abstract_narration": "Differential migration in birds creates skewed latitudinal                 wintering distributions of sex and age classes.  Both endogenous                and exogenous factors influence migration patterns, although the                relative effects vary greatly between species, and among                        individuals within a species.  A strong endogenous component may                control migratory features such as migration distance, direction                and timing.  This project intends to examine the roles of                       endogenous and exogenous factors in settlement patterns of                      juvenile female and male Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri).                   The expression of Zugunruhe (migratory restlessness) and                        orientation in juveniles of different sex will be measured. The                 effects of restricted food resources and social status on the                   expression of Zugunruhe in juveniles before and after the                       termination of migration will be examined.  The behavior of                     short-stopped, free-living juveniles to compare the ability of                  the sexes to live in the northern part of the species winter                    range, and area where females do not typically settle will be                   monitored.  This study will contribute to the understanding of                  the evolution of differential migration, as it incorporates                     analysis of both heritable and ecological factors in explaining                 the distribution of sex classes during the nonbreeding season.",
