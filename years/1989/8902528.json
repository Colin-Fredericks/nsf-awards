 "awd_abstract_narration": "Japanese skills in applied research and manufacturing have enabled              them to take over markets for many products.  More recently, they               have begun to excel in targeted areas of basic research.                        Assessment of such Japanese R & D is necessary to guide management              of U.S. research and to ensure that the most advanced technologies              are available to the United States.  The proposal presents plans                and methodologies for a study of Japanese R & D in five emerging                engineering technologies (to be determined) where focussed funding              could accelerate progress in the United States.  The detailed                   research will be done by five expert panels who will analyze                    Japanese literature, visit Japanese laboratories and present their              findings in workshops and technical reports.  Several Federal                   agencies have agreed to support funding to this phase of the                    study.",
