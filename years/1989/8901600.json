The principal                 areas of concentration are Hamiltonian methods, equations of                    nonlinear elasiticity, and Cartan equivalence problems.                         Particular applications include:  Hamiltonian structures and                    conservation laws for quasilinear hyperbolic systems, including                 gas dynamics and nonlinear elastic models, 2. multi-Hamiltonian                 systems and  quantization, 3.  nonlinear dissipation and normal                 forms for ordinary differential equations, 4.  conservation                     laws, symmetries, canonical forms and invariants for planar                     elastic materials, 5.  equilvalence problems from the calculus                  of variations, 6.  Lie algebras and equivalence of differential                 operators with applications to molecular dynamics, and 7.                       classical invariant theory.  Although the project covers a wide                 range of material, the different subjects inter-connect and                     reinforce each other in many ways, and the resulting                            combination of algebra, differential geometry and physical                      applications has proved to be an extremely fertile area of                      research.",
