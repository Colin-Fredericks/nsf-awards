 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will acquire several                   items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool                   of shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for                      use on or in association with the three research vessels the                    institution operates.  A substantial part of the ships'                         operating schedule during 1989 is in support of NSF-sponsored                   research projects.  The instrumentation will also increase                      the capabilities of the ships and of the institution to                         support research and engineering activities.  The                               instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                                       -Precision Integrated Navigational system for continuously                       monitoring the research vessel's position from a variety of                     navigational aids,                                                             -High purity water system for producing reagent quality water                    for shipboard analytical systems,                                              -Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler spares for insuring                           continuous measurements of subsurface circulation features,                    -Rosette sampler for collecting discrete seawater samples at                     specific water depths,                                                         -Survey quality LORAN radionavigation receiver,                                 -CTD maintenance and upgrade for obtaining detailed profiles                     of seawater conductivity and temperature as a function of                       depth,                                                                         -Plotter for display of seafloor profiles,                                      -Optical disk drive system and other equipment for increasing                    shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities, and                              -Precision salinometer and titroprocessor for determining                        the salinity of seawater.                                                                                                                                      The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the Institution to support NSF-sponsored                          research and engineering projects.",
