 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predator-prey theory suggests that key factors determining                 predator-prey coexistence in a patchy environment include:  1)                  predation rates in patches with predators; 2) prey fitness in                   patches without predators; and 3) patterns of movement among                    patches.                                                                             The proposed research will examine factors that influence                  the coexistence of small-mouthed salamander larvae with predatory               sunfish at two spatial scales: in stream pools and in streams                   consisting of a series of pools, some of which lack fish.  The                  proposed work includes 3 components:  A) field surveys to                       estimate larval survivorship in fish and fishless pools, and                    larval movement among pools; B) field studies on the effects of                 larval behaviors on survivorship and dispersal among fish and                   fishless pools; and C) field experiments on the survivorship in                 fish pools.                                                                          Surprisingly few empirical studies have examined the effects               of behavior on predator-prey coexistence in a pathcy environment.                                                                                               This study will include:  1) detailed data on the effects of                    behavior on the three factors affecting coexistence (listed                     above); and 2) assessments of behavioral correlations that can                  produce important indirect effects on coexistence patterns.",
