 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interactions of phospholipases A1, A2, and phosphatidylinositol-                specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) with lipid membrane systems                   will be investigated with respect to the mechanisms of action,                  substrate specificities, interactions with lipid interfaces, and                the nature of activation by the lipid interface.  Kinetics will                 be studied using thiolester substrate analogs a continuous                      spectrophotometric assay with mixed-micelles, and with short-                   chain substrate homologs in monolayer systems.  Protein-lipid                   interactions will be studied by fluorescence spectroscopy, and by               penetration of proteins into monolayers of non-hydrolyzable                     phospholipids.  Genetically engineered native hepatic lipase                    (phospholipase A1) and mutants (at the putative lipid-binding                   site) expressed from cDNA of rat hepatic lipase will be studied.                The kinetics of PI-PLC from Baccilus cereus will be studied in                  micellar systems with thiophosphate ester analogs of                            phosphatidylinositol, and in a monolayer system.  The kinetics of               phospholipase A2 (PLA2 from human synovial fluid will be studied                in mixed-micelle and monolayer systems.  PLA2S from porcine                     pancreas, and snake venom (Crotalus adamanteus) will also be                    studied.  The nature of autocatalytic derivatization of PLA2 by                 acyl transfer from the substrate, and its subsequent dimerization               and activation, will be investigated with fluorescent-labeled                   substrate analogs.                                                                                                                                              These are very attractive proteins with which to study protein-                 lipid interactions since they act preferentially at the lipid-                  water interface and have a functional activity which can readily                be followed.  Although much enzymology has been done on soluble                 enzymes with soluble substrates, many enzymes act at membrane                   interfaces.  The significance of this research is the                           understanding of the interactions of enzymes with lipid                         substrates at an interface.",
