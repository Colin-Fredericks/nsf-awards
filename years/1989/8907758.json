 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Creese is studying the work of women in chemical research                   between 1800 and 1940.  The project is based on an examination of               women's publications in the technical literature, primarily the                 journals published in Britain, France, Germany, Russia/USSR, and                the United States.  Dr. Creese is establishing for each country                 how much research was done by women chemists, who they were,                    where they were working and what areas they were specializing in.               This will provide a unique base from which she will compare and                 contrast the work of women chemists in the countries considered.                In addition, she expects to fill in biographical details for many               of the women involved.  This approach, with a slid basis in the                 original technical literature, gives a picture of the                           achievements of women chemists both broader and more detailed                   than anything so far published.  This project is part of the on-                going reassessment of women's historical roles in society.",
