 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of adenosine analogs as therapeutic agents for epilepsy                 and stroke has attracted increasing attention in recent years.                  In the central nervous system, adenosine serves as a powerful                   neuromodulator and has been shown to act as an endogenous                       anticonvulsant in certain regions of the brain.  Two general                    classes of adenosine receptors have been identified (i.e. A1 and                A2) and evidence has been presented for the existence of at least               one additional type of receptor.  While the powerful inhibitory                 action of adenosine A1 receptors on neuronal activity has been                  well characterized over the last decade, little is known of the                 physiological role of non.A1 receptors in the CNS.                              Electrophysiological studies (see below) indicate that non.A1                   sites do indeed have a significant impact on electrophysiological               responses in the hippocampus.  These experiments will utilize                   intracellular and extracellular recording techniques to define                  and characterize the functional role(s) of adenosine non.A1 sites               in the CNS.                                                                                                                                                     Dr. Lee has also demonstrated that A1 receptors are distributed                 differentially in the hippocampus and that non.A1 sites are                     associated with presynaptic elements in the stratum lucidum of                  CA3 and with postsynaptic elements in the stratum pyramidale of                 CA1.  These differences permit meaningful experiments examining                 regions enriched in non.A1 sites which are associated with known                structural elements (i.e. presynaptic or postsynaptic).  The                    first goal of this research project is to define the                            physiological impact of non.presynaptic sites in the CA3 region.                The second goal of these studies is to verify that the observed                 effects are receptor mediated and to characterize the type(s) of                receptor mediating the effects.  The third goal is to ascertain                 whether activation of protein kinase C blocks non.A1 effects, as                has been described for other electrophysiological actions of                    adenosine in the hippocampus.                                                                                                                                   The experiments should provide the first direct evidence                        regarding the electrophysiological function of adenosine non.A1                 sites in the CNS.  In addition, the studies should characterize                 the type(s) of receptor (i.e. A2 or another) mediating non.A1                   responses.  The results of these studies will greatly enhance our               understanding of the adenosine neuromodulatory system and will                  furnish critical information for the evaluation of specific                     therapeutic agents designed to target individual components of                  this system.",
