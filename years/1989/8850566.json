 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to produce prototypical                materials which will better enable students to link the mathematical            operations of arithmetic with their applications.  The target audience          for the materials tryout will be average and below average middle school        students, and in some cases adapted and given to younger or more able           students as well.  A secondary objective will be to explore means of            involving natural settings, rather than the traditional \"story\"                 problems, in the lessons.                                                                                                                                       The rationale for this project is based on recent research which                suggests that many middle school students approach mathematical story           problems, the most common school form of applications of the arithmetic         operations, with strategies that are not based on possible meanings for         the operations.  Although some of these strategies may give success on          many one-step story problems with whole numbers, their use with                 multi-step problems involving fractions or decimals is unlikely to give         correct solutions.                                                                                                                                              This project will develop and field test with middle school students,           materials to give a greater emphasis to meanings for the operations.            The outcome from the materials should provide improvement in the                students' approaches to applications of the operations, both in school          and in natural settings.  Teachers, supervisors, publishers,                    psychologists, and subject-matter experts will be called on to help             insure that the materials have maximum usability.  Dissemination plans          include distribution of the materials to text publishers, to give them          prototypes and research support for such lessons in their textbooks.",
