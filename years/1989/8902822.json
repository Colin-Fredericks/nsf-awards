 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Vertebrate Paleontology collection and associated                      research program at the Florida Museum of Natural History is one                of the leading programs of its kind and ranks in the top ten in                 North America.  This project will provide funds for major                       curatorial improvements to this collection to enhance its utility               as a research resource.                                                              Throughout the last two decades the Vertebrate Paleontology                collection has grown at a phenomenal pace, on average by about                  10% per year.  This collection currently contains about 300,000                 potentially catalogable specimens of which about only 135,000 are               entered onto a computerized data base.  The specimens not on the                data base, although physically accessible for study, suffer from                the fact that they cannot be retrieved during computer searches                 and sorts.  With the rapid growth in computerized data bases                    within the last ten years, it is imperative that as many                        specimens as possible be computerized.  During this project                     period, the PIs will curate and enter the specimens from the                    collection's extensive Florida localities.  The goal in three                   years is to add approximately 55,000 new specimens to the                       computerized catalog.                                                                Another major problem resulting from the very rapid growth                 of the collection has been lack of sufficient space to curate,                  study, and house these important scientific specimens.  The                     project will provide funds to install movable storage units                     (\"compactors\") that will greatly increase (by about 30%) the net                usable space for storage of smaller specimens.  During the same                 time, the PIs also will reorganize the collection's large                       vertebrate specimens (e.g., whales, mastodons and mammoths, and                 giant ground sloths)onto specially designed metal shelves that                  more efficiently use the available space.                                            These collections improvements are the optimal means of                    enhancing the research capabilities of this important scientific                resource and should solve the collection's needs into the                       beginning of the 21st century.",
