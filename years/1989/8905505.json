The                       fellowship is designed to provide 24 months of support divided                  into 18 academic months and 3 periods of two summer months.  The                recipient has the option of a Research Instructorship which                     allows the 18 months of academic support to be taken as 9 months                of full-time support and 18 months of half-time support.                        Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship awards                   allow fellows to choose research environments that will have                    maximal impact on their future scientific development.                               Todd Arbogast received his doctoral degree from the                        University of Chicago, and will pursue research in the area of                  applied mathematics, specifically, the simulation of flow in                    naturally fractured porous media, under the guidance of Mary                    Wheeler at the University of Houston.",
