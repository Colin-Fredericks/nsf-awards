 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each area of investigation relates to geometric questions in               the theory of functions of complex and real variables.  Functions               of interest include both holomorphic and quasiconformal mappings.               This work includes a continuing effort to find simple geometric                 conditions that can be used to determine if a domain in Euclidean               space can support the Poincare inequality.  This is actually a                  class of inequalities measuring the integral of (the absolute                   value of) a function against the integral of a power of the                     function's gradient.  The inequality provides information as to                 whether or not certain boundary value problems in partial                       differential equations can be solved on the given domain.  The                  best results to date have been obtained for two-dimensional                     domains.  Evidence suggests that any general criterion will                     involve the behavior of a particular non-Euclidean metric                       attached to a domain.                                                                Work is also planned on the influence of differentiation on                the distribution of roots of entire functions.  More                            specifically, real entire functions having only real roots are                  under consideration.  It is not true that roots of the derivative               must also be real, and one main objective of this work is to                    measure the number of non-real roots that one can expect on                     successive differentiation.  Ultimately, one would like to get                  asymptotic estimates on the number of roots, to attack a                        long-standing conjecture of Polya.                                                   A third area of investigation concerns spaces of holomorphic               functions which are area integrable - Bergman spaces.  Analysis                 of the mapping properties of such functions is pertinent to the                 theory of quasiconformal mappings.  Many such mappings may share                the same boundary values.  Among them will be maps which have                   extreme dilatations.  A characterization of the extremal mappings               has never been obtained.  This work seeks to use the Bergman                    spaces to show that for nonconstant extreme dilatations, the                    argument of such functions cannot be too limited.",
