 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Cytosystematics of Cyprinid Fishes\" between Dr.               John R. Gold Texas A&M University and Professor Li Yucheng of Wuhan             University is jointly sponsored by NSF and the Chinese State                    Educational Commission (SEDC).                                                                                                                                  The investigators propose to investigate interspecific variations in            chromosomal NOR phenotypes among 10-14 species of cyprinid fishes               from the western United States and mainland China.  They will                   investigate interspecies homologies of NOR-bearing chromosomes by               chromosome C-banding, restriction enzyme banding, and a newly                   developed method which produces what appear to be analogous to G- (or           R-) type bands in higher vertebrates.  The long-term goals of the               project are to assess the cytosystematics and evolutionary history of           cyprinid fishes and to evaluate the role that chromosomal alterations           have played in that evolutionary history.  The systematic objectives            of the research are to test the hypotheses that the western North               American cyprinids to be examined are (i) monophyletic, and (ii)                derived phylogenetically from an Asian lineage in the cyprinid                  subfamily Leuciscinae.  Data for each species examined will include the         number, position(s), and chromosome type(s) of all NOR sites.  C- and           other banding phenotypes will provide critical tests of homology, of            NOR chromosomes with identical phenotypes and also putatively identify          chromosomal rearrangements involving NOR sites.  The chromosomal data           will be analyzed phylogenetically using outgroup comparison.                    Additional benefits will include the intellectual merger of two of              the leading fish cytosystematic laboratories in the world, and the              possibility of future collaboration on a variety of projects.  The              investigators will also attempt to promote an exchange of both                  alcohol-preserved specimens and frozen tissues from a variety of fish           species.",
