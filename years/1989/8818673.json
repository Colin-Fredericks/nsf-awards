 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal is to understand the structural basis of                       sequence recognition by DNA binding proteins.  These studies                    have centered on the type II restriction-modification systems                   of bacteria, and in particular on the Pvu II system that was                    previously cloned from Proteus vulgaris.  Four proteins that                    recognize the same DNA sequence which includes the Pvu II                       proteins will be characterized and compared.  This comparison                   will be both structural and functional, and is intended to                      indicate the extent to which functionally-related proteins                      recognizing a common base sequences show structural homologies.                                                                                                 The recognition of specific DNA sequences by proteins is so                     crucial to so many cellular processes that no mature                            understanding of cell physiology will be possible without                       understanding the basis of this recognition.  These processes                   include promoter selection by RNA polymerases, the action of                    repressors, activators, enhancer-modulation, genetic                            recombination and transposition, and targeted DNA repair.  Dr.                  Blumenthal is well trained for the work described here.",
