 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is aimed at building a compact laser pulse                source which has been the bottleneck for five years in development of           an ultrafast optically triggered oscilloscope, an instrument imprtant           in the evaluation of high speed integrated circuits and microwave               devices.  Current laser pulsers are large, require continuous                   maintenance, and consume up to 15 kilowatts of electricity.  The pulse          source proposed here uses low maintenance diode laser, is small, and            draws a few watts of power.  This very special instrumentation is               needed to test the new highspeed integrated circuits, GaAs microwave            devices and picosecond transistors, for picosecond synchronization of           electron beam devices and high energy lasers, for generating precise            waveform high power microwave bursts, and for driving analog to                 digital converter with 30 GHz sampling rates.  Picosecond resolution            is needed to extract the maximum speed and efficiency and therefore             economic advantage from ultrafast electronics.  The pulse optical               source use multiple semiconductor lasers which operate at different             frequencies and are phaselocked together to produce pulses.  This               unique approach solves the bandwidth and group velocity mismatch                problems rater than fighting with them as in done in present                    modelocked lasers.  The project objectives include a simple                     preliminary demonstration of the concept and enough modeling to                 interpret the results..j\u0002.\u001a***//",
