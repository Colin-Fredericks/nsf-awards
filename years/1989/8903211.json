In addition,                   they plan to establish the well-posedness of several models for                 reservoir simulation, including their derivation via                            homogenization techniques and the study of their regularity                     properties.                                                                          Specifically, many questions related to several types of                   flows in naturally fractured reservoirs will be studied both                    theoretically and numerically.  Included will be single-phase                   flows, two-phase immiscible flows, and miscible flows.  The                     implementation of computational models for such flows will be                   carried out on parallel computers, after the models have been                   validated on workstations.                                                           A model for the propagation of waves in composite media                    consisting in part of elastic solids and in part of porous                      material saturated by a multi-phase fluid will be developed,                    beginning from basic physics and continuing through regularity                  and numerical approximation.  The model will be applied to                      acoustic well-logging as an extension of current work on the                    Biot, single-phase model.  THe numerical methods will be                        formulated so that parallel and vector computation is natural.",
