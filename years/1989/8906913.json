This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and                Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                     program is designed to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers               to conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the conduct                of joint research and the use of unique or complementary facilities,            expertise and experimental conditions in foreign countries.                                                                                                     The award will support a ten month research visit by Dr. Joseph A.              Ghiold of Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge, with Dr.                   Kenneth J. McNamara, Curator, Department of Paleontology, Western               Australia Museum, Perth, Australia.  The researchers will analyze               the interplay of current ecological and historical factors which                jointly shape the biogeographic subdivision of these marine                     benthic organisms.  This goal will be achieved by: (1) accumulation             of data pertaining to the paleobiogeographic distribution and                   stratigraphic range of fossil spatangoid species; (2) comparison of             spatangoid paleobiogeographic patterns with those of modern                     spatangoids; (3) subsequent analysis of these patterns in terms of              area phenograms supplemented with independent paleontologic and                 geologic data; (4) comparison of these results to those previously              determined for clypeasteroid echinoids and various shelf benthos.               Results from this study will help assess the importance of                      historical biogeography in explaining current patterns of the                   biosphere and the potential of the fossil record as a source of                 biogeographic information.  This project may shed some light on                 the historical routes of evolution and on the dynamics of                       evolutionary processes that shaped the world biotas.                                                                                                            The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,               international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents'                 allowance, if applicable, and a flat administrative allowance of                $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.",
