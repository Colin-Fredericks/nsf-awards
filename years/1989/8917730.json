 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research addresses the relationship between observations               of mantle heterogeneity and the history of subduction for about                 the last 200 Myr.  This work requires coordinated efforts in two                fields, namely, theoretical geodynamics and global tectonics.                   Subducted slabs constitute the largest known density constrasts                 in the mantle.  The largest-scale seismic velocity and geoid                    anomalies are not correlated with present-day plate tectonics,                  but are qualitatively similar to older (100-200 Myr B.P.)                       configurations of subduction.  This suggests that the large-scale               pattern of mantle convection is dominated by the long-term                      patterns of subduction.  The project will test this hypothesis                  quantitatively for various convection models.  Previous mapping                 of Pacific Basin convergency zones (0-180 Myr B.P.) will be                     expanded to include other important paleosubduction zones in the                Indian Ocean Basin and elsewhere.  Subducted plate ages, rates,                 and locations will be converted into a corresponding map for the                injection of thermal buoyancy into the upper mantle.  The                       trajectories of slabs due to mantle flow will be calculated using               a well-developed analytical method for low in spherical shells.                 Both chemically layered and viscosity layered convection models                 driven subducted buoyancy forces will be explored.  These                       dynamical models for the fate of old subduted slabs will be                     rigorously correlated with observations bearing on density                      contrasts in the mantle, particularly the new observations of                   seismic heterogeneity, the gravity field, and plate velocities.                 By integrating knowledge of plate tectonic history with present-                day geophysical observations and convection theory, this work                   will provide entirely new constraints on the large-scale nature                 of mantle convection.",
