 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will introduce into grades two through six at fifteen sites        in Arkansas a program that integrates science and mathematics.  Eighty          students will selected to participate in each of three phases (grades           two-three, grades four-five, grade six).  A search will be undertaken           for suitable, existing materials; additional instructional materials            will be developed as needed.  The program will emphasize critical               thinking skills and will exploit the computer and other educational             technology when appropriate.                                                                                                                                    An intensive teacher training effort will coincide with the curriculum          development activities.  A pair of teachers from each of the fifteen            sites will attend a three-week program in order to upgrade their                knowledge of mathematics and science to the level demanded by the               integrated curriculum that is adopted, and to become familiar with the          instructional materials to be used.  Such sessions will be held each            summer for four years, thereby bringing the number of trained teachers          to 120.  The first year the focus will be on second and third grade             teachers; in subsequent years teachers in progressively higher grades           will participate.  In each summer, sixty local elementary students will         attend these sessions and help with tests of new materials and teaching         methods.                                                                                                                                                        The dissemination of this trial program to other schools in Arkansas            will occur within the frame work of Governor Clinton's Restructured             School Program.  A precursor to the proposed new program, enrichment in         mathematics for gifted students, also benefited from input from the             Governor's Office, and has been declared a success, particularly by             reducing the performance gap between, minority and majority students.           The faculty members from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock who          manage the older program will also oversee the new one.  In addition,           leadership and advice will be provided by a Board of Advisors and by            expert consultants.                                                                                                                                             This project will serve as a model for university/school/statehouse             collaboration on a statewide basis.  The cost sharing from state and            local sources is forty-five percent of the NSF contribution.",
