 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dennis is carrying out studies on the detailed mechanisms                   of action of cobra venom phospholipase A2 at the lipid-water                    interface.  He has accumulated evidence that its activity is                    dramatically affected by interfaces, that it binds more than                    one phospholipid at the lipid/water interface and that this                     binding can cause both an activation and an aggregation of                      the enzyme.  It is planned to probe the structural details of                   the interaction between substrate, activators, products and                     the phospholipase A2.                                                                                                                                           Enzymes of lipid metabolism are unique in that they act                         physiologically on complex substrate aggregates.  Discerning                    the means by which these enzymes carry out their cellular                       functions requires not only a knowledge of classical                            enzymology, but also an understanding of how these large                        aggregates and the interfaces they form modulate enzyme and                     substrate behavior.  The goal of this research is to                            understand how lipolytic enzymes interact with aggregated                       lipids and their interfaces.  The study also has direct                         application to understanding how the phospholipase A, which                     is involved in arachidonic acid release for prostaglandin                       biosynthesis, acts.***//",
