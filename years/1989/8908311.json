 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many problems in science and engineering require solution of                    symmetric positive definite systems of linear equations.                        Although practical systems can be huge, each equation often                     involves only a small number of the variables.  These systems are               called sparse, and recently there has been considerable interest                in solving such systems on parallel message-passing machines such               as the hypercube.  However, efficient parallel solvers that run                 significantly faster than standard sequential codes do not yet                  exist.  Several approaches to remedying this situation will be                  examined.  By studying the relationship between sparsity,                       elimination tree height, and parallelism, one can devise good                   algorithms for reordering the coefficient matrix to allow for                   efficient parallel factorization.  The height of the elimination                tree is one measure of parallelism; an algorithm will reduce the                height of this tree.  In addition, it is planned to investigate                 methods for limiting the communication overhead on message-                     passing multiprocessors and for distributing the load more                      carefully among the processors.  These techniques will reduce                   the current difficulties with factoring sparse matrices in                      parallel and will enable an efficient implementation.",
