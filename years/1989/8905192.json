 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alleghanian Orogeny in the southern Appalachians                       includes both thrust fault and strike-slip fault regimes.  A                    classic fold and thrust belt has been described in the Valley and               Ridge and Blue Ridge provinces and, from seismic reflection,                    overthrusts have been projected beneath the Piedmont.  Strike-                  slip has been documented in several major shear zones.  However,                the timing between the thrust movement and the strike-slip move-                ment are controversial.  This project will examine a portion of                 the Grandfather Mountain window near Marion, North Carolina where               both the Linville Falls (thrust) fault and the Brevard (primarily               strike-slip strain indicators) are in close proximity.  Shear                   sense indicators will be mapped in an attempt to determine                      relative timing between the different fault types and to                        determine the nature of the interaction or overprinting fabric                  relations in such a system.  Results will help resolve a long-                  standing question int he southern Appalachians, and should                      provide insight into overprinting fabric development in general.",
