This group of scientists will be delivering scientific                 papers on the neural and behavioral principles of the distinctive               escape response that involves the Mauthner neurons of fish and                  amphibians.  The Mauthner system is conserved among all the                     vertebrates and plays a fundamental role in the control of                      movements such as locomotion and orientation of the body.  It is                a very simple system which is analogous to the reticulospinal                   system found in mammals, including man.  The symposium to be held               will consolidate our knowledge of the Mauthner system as a model                for reticulospinal function as found in man.",
