 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past research shows that many behaviors and physiological                       processes tend to vary cyclically.  It has been suggested that                  during social interaction, these behavioral and physiological                   rhythms become coordinated between partners; and that greater                   coordination between partners is accompanied by more positive                   feelings.  However, few studies have actually examined                          coordination of rhythms during social interaction.  This study                  will explore the coordination of rhythms in 100 dyads.                          Variations in amount of talking, blood pressure, heart rate, and                palmar sweating will be analyzed to evaluate (1) whether there is               evidence that each of these processes tends to vary cyclically;                 and (2) whether pairs of subjects who show close coordination of                physiological rhythms tend to show more positive affect than                    pairs of subjects who show little or no coordination.  Another                  question that will be considered is the relative importance of                  coordination of rhythms compared to other well.established                      factors that are known to influence liking (such as attitude                    similarity and physical attractiveness).  This research will                    provide new information about a basic and controversial question                that is central to social interaction research.  Many theorists                 believe that when there is marked cyclicity in behavioral and                   physiological processes and close coordination between partners,                the social interaction is going well, and that these smoothly                   coordinated rhythms are associated with positive feelings and                   interpersonal attraction.  There is speculation that (over the                  long term), disorganization or decoupling among behavioral and                  physiological rhythms is detrimental to physical and mental                     health.  However, there are a few researchers who have argued the               opposite point of view, claiming that coordination of cyclical                  behavior between partners is an indication that the social system               is not functioning well.  They argue that close coordination is                 an indication of a lack of flexibility or spontaneity.  The                     results of this study will help to decide whether more                          rhythmically structured social interactions have positive or                    negative consequences for the way participants feel.",
