 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic                    and Organometallic Chemistry Program is the synthesis and                       characterization of compounds consisting of clusters of                         molybdenum, iron and sulfur atoms. Such clusters are related to                 the iron-molybdenum cofactor, familiarly known as FeMo-co, of                   the enzyme nitrogenase. This cofactor, which has a currently                    unknown structure, constitutes a key portion of the enzyme's                    active site. Studies of the target compounds are needed in                      order to assess those aspects of the structural and chemical                    properties of FeMo-co which are essential to the \"fixing\" of                    atmospheric nitrogen through reduction by the enzyme.                           Nitrogenase catalyzes one of the most complex multi-electron                    transfer reactions in biology, so that understanding the                        structure and reactivity of its active site is of fundamental                   chemical and biochemical importance. Further, a catalytic                       cluster resembling the active site may be a powerful catalyst                   for a variety of chemical transformations.                                                                                                                      Systematic syntheses of high nuclearity Mo-Fe-S clusters will                   be explored. Emphasis will be placed on controlling the                         structural reorganizations that occur during oxidative                          decarbonylation reactions in order to prepare new Mo-S-Fe                       clusters that may mimic FeMo-co structurally and which will                     bind small molecules that are nitrogenase substrates or                         inhibitors in dinitrogen reduction. The synthetic species will                  be characterized by chemical and physical methods, and their                    reactivities will be investigated, with emphasis on a                           systematic examination of the reactivity of the different metal                 sites within a given cluster.",
