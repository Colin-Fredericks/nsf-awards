 "awd_abstract_narration": "It would come as no surprise in the folklore of modern                          industrial society that 'partners in crime' were especially                     likely to be 'brothers in crime', or more generally siblings  or                members of the same family.   Whether that is supported by                      careful analysis of appropriate data, or more precisely how  and                why this is true -- is the subject of this research                             project. Little is actually known in general about the                          mechanisms by which siblings come to resemble each other in                     delinquent behavior or about the dynamics of family processes                   that may lead to sibling resemblance.  This will be the first                   large scale research into these mechanisms. The project will                    undertake a state-of-the-art analyses of a sample of 470                        sibling pairs. The study will also take advantage of data  from                 the National Youth Survey, perhaps the best dataset                             collected on the social-psychological determinants of                           delinquency. Under study will be the relative effects on a                      sibling's delinquent behavior (if any) of 1) parents'                           positive or negative concepts of each sibling (seen as                          getting along well with people or as a rule-breaker, for                        example), 2) the sibling's own concepts of themselves as                        viewed by significant others' (teachers', friends', the other                   sibling), 3) parental delinquent behaviors and 4) other                         sibling's delinquent behavior. The effects of the gender                        composition (both male, both female or mixed) of the sibling                    pair will also be studied. This research, undertaken by a                       promising young criminologist, will also break ground in the                    general study of sibling models and of the family                               'inheritance' of other types of behaviors.",
