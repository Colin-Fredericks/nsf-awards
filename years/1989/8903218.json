 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program supports the work of Dr. K. Barry                 Sharpless.  Sharpless, Prof. of Chemistry at MIT, continues his                 pioneering investigations of new reagents for organic                           synthesis.  His current work is, in part, directed towards                      examining how metals complex to existing groups in a molecule                   to direct new reactions to a particular site.  Notable new                      directions include trying to develop methods that do not                        require an existing tether to direct the chemistry.                                                                                                             Sharpless's group continues to investigate the mechanistic                      details of ligand-accelerated catalysis of reactions, and how                   this leads to the remarkable enantioselectivity observed for                    the reactions. As part of his mechanistic investigations he has                 recently discovered a process for dihydroxylating an isolated                   alkene bond without prior binding of the reagent to the                         substrate.  This discovery opens a whole new arena for                          scientific enquiry, and has great potential for synthetic                       chemists.   His group is trying to also understand the origins                  of this process.  Sharpless will \"comb the periodic table\"                      looking for new reagents to add to the arsenal already                          available to the synthesis chemist.  Initial scrutiny will be                   given to finding unique metal/ hydroperoxide combinations to                    carry out asymmetric epoxidation to isolated alkenes.  A unique                 assay system, analgous to that used for screening for                           bioactivity of molecules, will be employed to examine large                     series of reactions.",
