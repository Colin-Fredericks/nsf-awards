 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cenozoic nonmarine sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the                   southern Colorado Plateau and adjacent Verde Basin are divided                  into five tectonostratigraphic packages that document stages in                 the evolution of the transition zone between the Colorado Plateau               and the Basin and Range provinces in central Arizona.  These two                units are differentiated on the basis of, 1) geomorphic position,               2) clast composition and provenance variations, 3) tectonic                     setting and structural history, and 4) radiometric ages of                      intercalcated volcanics.                                                             The areal extent, lithology, provenance, depositional                      environments and age of these stratigraphic units are poorly                    constrained, and differences of opinion exist as to their                       interpretation.  One school of thought is that the Colorado                     Plateau escarpment was formed by erosion during the Oligocene,                  and the other is that it was formed by extensional faulting                     beginning during the Miocene, less than 10 million years ago.                   Until these contradictory interpretations of the geologic history               of the Plateau margin are resolved, the tectonic and geomorphic                 history of the Colorado Plateau and Basin and Range provinces                   remains speculative.                                                                 This study will establish the age relationships, and                       environmental and tectonic history of the Cenozoic rocks in the                 southern Colorado Plateau-Mogollon Rim area.  These                             interpretations will be based on petrologic and facies analyses                 of five tectonostratigraphic packages and more precise definition               of their ages based on paleontology, K-Ar and fission track                     dating.",
