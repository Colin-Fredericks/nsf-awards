 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in commutative algebra and                algebraic geometry of Professors Melvin Hochster, Igor Dolgachev,               and Kevin Coombes of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Dr.               Hochster has introduced the fruitful notion of tight closure of                 rings, and will continue his study of this concept, as well as                  several problems in local algebra. Dr. Dolgachev will be working                on the classification of Enriques surfaces with finitely many                   automorphisms over fields of arbitrary characteristic, and will                 investigate a number of other questions in the theory of                        surfaces. Dr. Coombes will be studying more number-theoretic                    questions, namely the geometry of arithmetic surfaces, especially               the theory of branched covers of arithmetic surfaces and of                     curves defined over fields of arithmetic interest.                                   This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and               Topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical Computer Science and in Robotics.",
