 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Duke University Marine Laboratory will acquire several                      items of oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool                   of shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for                      use on or in association with the R/V CAPE HATTERAS, a                          research vessel owned by the NSF and operated by Duke                           University.  A substantial part of the ship's operating                         schedule during 1989 is in support of NSF-sponsored research                    projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                           capabilities of the ship and of the institution to support                      research and engineering activities.  The instrumentation                       includes:                                                                                                                                                       -Box corer for collecting undisturbed sediment samples from                      the seafloor,                                                                  -Computer and other hardware upgrades for the SAIL shipboard                     data logging system,                                                           -Spectrophometer for measuring light levels and other optical                    properties in the water column,                                                -Optical disk drive system and for increasing shared-use                         computing capabilities at sea,                                                 -Parts for a Conductivity, Temperature and Depth profiling                       device,                                                                        -Enhancements to the single-channel digital seismic system,                     -Radio Direction Finder Antenna for locating floating                            instrumentation at sea.                                                                                                                                        The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored                         research and engineering projects.",
