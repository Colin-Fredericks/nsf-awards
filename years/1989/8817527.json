 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores possible mechanisms in the sulfite                        replacement of light in activating latent ATPase of pre-                        reduced or trypsin treated spinach thylakoids.  Sulfite might                   prevent inhibition by tightly bound ADP and magnesium ions.                                                                                                     Kinetics of Mg2+ and ADP inhibition are being investigated at                   different levels of energization, and with different states                     of thylakoid activation using sulfite.  Reduced CF1, depleted                   of adenylates by MgATP hydrolysis in 35% methanol should be                     permanently active.  Initial reactions will be studied by                       stop-flow technique, to see if lags are eliminated by sulfite                   or by adenylate depletion.                                                                                                                                      Dr. Jagendorf has made the interesting observation that                         sulfite can substitute for light leading to energy generation                   during photosynthesis.  He is now using this effect to study                    the basic mechanism of energy generation in chloroplasts.                       This process is of utmost importance to life on earth as it                     converts light to chemical energy for the production of                         carbohydrates.***//",
