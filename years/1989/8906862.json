 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program in support                   of the research of Dr. Steven Kass at the University of                         Minnesota. The research is concerned with the gas-phase                         reactions of organic ion-molecules as studied by the variable                   temperature Flowing Afterglow(FA) technique. The principal                      reactions to be studied will be unimolecular rearrangements,                    elimination reactions and the generation and characterization                   of novel anions.                                                                                                                                                Substituent effects, thermodynamic properties, reactivities and                 carbon-carbon bond cleavages  of gas-phase alkyl anions,                        generated by acid-base chemistry, will be obtained. A variety                   of ring-openings, proton and alkyl shifts and concerted                         reactions will be studied. Activation energies will be obtained                 by measuring rate coefficients as a function of temperature.                    Substitution versus elimination in the reaction of alkyl                        halides with bases will be explored and the preferred                           stereochemistry in 1,2- and in 1,4-eliminations will be                         studied.  The objective of these studies is to provide a                        greater appreciation for the relationship between structure and                 reactivity.",
