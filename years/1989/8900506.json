 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Biology Department at Cal State                University, Los Angeles to establish a Research Experience for                  Undergraduates Site.  Funds will support 8 undergraduate students               in seven areas of biological research:  Developmental Biology,                  Population Biology, Behavioral Genetics, Renal Physiology,                      Physiological Animal Ecology, Neurobiology, and Molecular                       Biology.                                                                                                                                                        The 8 students will be supported for 12 weeks of full time                      research during the summer of 1989.  At least 1/2 of these                      students will be recruited from 2-year and 4-year colleges and                  universities throughout California, with the remaining students                 from on campus.                                                                                                                                                 Minorities, women, disabled and economically disadvantaged                      students will be the target group.  Cal State L.A. has had no                   difficulty targeting these groups, since the majority of the                    students (70%) are minority, are women (56%), and are                           economically disadvantaged (90%).  The University also has an                   active disabled students program that recruits students with                    various physical disabilities.  The campus is located in East Los               Angeles servicing the San Gabriel Valley which is predominantly                 Hispanic.",
