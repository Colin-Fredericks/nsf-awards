 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study several problems from                the theories of partial differential equations and differential                 geometry.  He will construct complete Riemannian manifolds with                 special holonomy and study their relationship with the physical                 theories of \"supermembranes\" and \"supergravity.\"  Degenerate                    partial differential equations which arise in the geometry of 3-                manifolds and the theory of exterior differential systems will be               the subjects of two further investigations.                                          The interplay of ideas between the physics of gravitation                  and subatomic particles, and the mathematics of differential                    geometry and geometric partial differential equations, has become               intense in recent years.  Geometric structures which have been                  under development for many decades are now sufficiently powerful                to handle many new problems of modern physics.  The principal                   investigator will solve a problem in holonomy of Riemann                        manifolds which relates to recent theories of \"supergravity.\"",
