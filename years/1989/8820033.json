 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objective of this project is to fathom the                        processes by which the segmentally iterated, identified neurons                 of the nervous system of the leech Theromyzon rude acquire their                identity in embryonic development.  Experiments are designed to                 reveal whether the determination of the exact number of segments                to be formed (32), and if the specific identity of each segment                 and its set of neurons, is attributable to information intrinsic                to the segmental founder cell clones or to topographically fixed                external cues.  Other experiments will examine the extent to                    which the developmental decision between a neuronal and an                      epidermal fate among members of the segmental founder cell clones               resembles the corresponding decision process known to occur in                  insects.  Experimental methods will include intracellularly                     injected cell lineage tracers, indirect immunofluorescence, and                 specific cell ablations.                                                                                                                                        This project addresses the mechanisms underlying normal and                     abnormal embryonic development in an animal whose relative                      simplicity, high degree of order and ready experimental                         accessibility make it an unusually favorable experimental                       material.  Dr. Stent expects to obtain insights of general                      relevance for the understanding of developmental processes,                     including those governing human development, by studying the                    determination of cell fate in the leech embryo.",
