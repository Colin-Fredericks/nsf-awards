 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photosynthetic prokaryote, Prochlorothrix hollandica, is                    the only free-living bacterium known which contains the                         higher plant antenna pigment chlorophyll b.  This feature has                   initiated many comparative studies examining whether the P.                     hollandica antenna is structurally and functionally similar                     to that of higher plants.  Previous studies from other                          laboratories have shown that thylakoid membrane stacking                        occurs in P. hollandica, a function ascribed to the LHCII                       antenna of green plant chloroplasts.  Since the P. hollandica                   Chl a/b antenna is structurally simpler than chloroplast                        LHCII, this research studies the antenna proteins of P.                         hollandica to probe the structural basis for membrane                           stacking.  The experimental approach combines molecular                         biological, biochemical and biophysical techniques to address                   the following specific questions:  1) What are the                              evolutionary relationships among accessory Chl-proteins?; 2)                    How do photosynthetic organisms adapt to changing light                         conditions?; and 3) What are the structural requirements for                    thylakoid membrane stacking?%%%                                                                                                                                 The light reactions of oxygen evolving photosynthesis involve                   two kinds of membrane-bound pigment-binding complexes,those                     which are involved in the primary photochemistry and those                      which serve an accessory antenna function by harvesting light                   energy to be transferred to the primary systems.  A great                       deal of information has been recently obtained about the                        chlorophyll-proteins.  In contrast, the structure of many                       antenna complexes is not known to this high level of                            resolution.  The focus of this research is to examine a class                   of prokaryotic antenna chlorophyll-proteins to help                             understand their synthesis, assembly and relatedness to                         chloroplast antennae systems.***",
