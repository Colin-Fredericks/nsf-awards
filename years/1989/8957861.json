 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research effort is to design and                     develop manufacturing enterprise architecture (MEA), which will                 serve as a blueprint for the implementation of computer                         integrated manufacturing (CIM) in the factory of the future.                    This approach is necessary to the domain of manufacturing,                      especially in the context of CIM.  During the initial phase of                  the research, the apparel/textile manufacturing sector will be                  used for the development of the Textile Apparel Manufacturing                   Architecture (TAMA).  Methodologies currently available for the                 development of such an architecture, do not lend themselves well                to the investigation since symbolic knowledge plays a crucial                   role in the successful operation of an enterprise (e.g., in                     production planning and scheduling).  TAMA will subsequently be                 generalized to encompass other manufacturing processes.  Issues                 related to a domain or industry independent view of manufacturing               will also be investigated.  Thus, the five-year research                        objective is not only to have a successful implementation of CIM                in textile/apparel manufacturing, but also to have a generic MEA                for the factory of the future.",
