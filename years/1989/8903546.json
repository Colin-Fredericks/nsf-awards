 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enzyme structure-function studies require both dynamic and                      static approaches.  Among the various kinetic methods, isotopic                 exchange at chemical equilibrium can provide a unique approach                  for addressing mechanistic questions.  The theoretical basis                    and practical basis for this method was dramatically advanced                   recently by the PI's development of computer simulation methods                 for exchange data analysis.  Equilibrium isotope exchange                       kinetics was proven to be especially useful for determining                     kinetic mechanism and defining which steps are altered by bound                 effectors or by mutation of specific amino acid residues.                                                                                                       The enzymes proposed for study were selected for their                          potential to advance fundamental knowledge, the crucial                         regulatory role each plays in a key metabolic pathway, their                    complex responses to effectors, and identification of                           important, yet unanswered mechanistic questions that can be                     addressed uniquely by EIEK methods:                                             a) Aspartate transcarbamylase regulates biosynthesis of                         pyrimidines needed for DNA.  Substrate analogs and mutant                       enzymes have been selected that will allow the dissection of                    the mechanisms by which the effectors ATP and CTP operate and                   to determine how interaction of substrate with active site                      groups triggers the dramatic conformational change of                           allosteric transition.                                                          b) Phosphorylase controls energy metabolism by mobilizing                       stored glucose (glycogen) into the glycolytic pathway.  The                     major challenges with this system will be determine which step                  (s) are altered by selected modifiers in an enzyme for which                    chemical catalysis, rather than substrate binding, appears to                   be the rate-limiting process in net turnover.                                                                                                                   Development of more advanced computer programs, to simulate                     complex enzyme behavior and for data fitting, is also essential                 to this project.  Routines for linear regression analysis will                  also be incorporated, to optimize data fitting and to help                      define confidence limits for the derived rate constants.",
