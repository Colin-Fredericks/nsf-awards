 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. David                London, University of Oklahoma and Drs. D. A. Manning and C.M.                  Henderson, Department of Geology, University of Manchester,                     England.  The joint study will focus on 1) the magmatic to                      hydrothermal transition in the Cornish granite systems, 2) the                  roles of boron and fluorine in melt-vapor evolution and metal                   transport and deposition, and (3) general modeling of the relations             between shallowly emplaced granite/greisen sytems (e.g., Cornwall)              and deeper granite/pegmatite equivalents.                                                                                                                       The granites and associated pegmatites, aplites, and Sn-Cu                      mineralized greisens of Cornwall and Devonshire, southwest England,             are recognized as a global type of differentiated silicic magmatism             and associated hydrothermal mineralization.  The late-stage                     evolution of these granites, in particular the temporal and                     compositional aspects of melt-vapor equilibria, represent a                     critically important stage of magmatism from both scientific and                economic perspectives.  Among the volatile or fluxing components in             the Cornish granite systems, the role of boron may be the most                  important and least understood.  The proposed work will document                the abundance and geologic associations of boron (as tourmaline) in             this environment, and the tourmaline will be studied for fluid                  inclusions that may uniquely reveal the compositions and physical               states of fluids generated in the granites and associated veins and             host rocks.  The results of this study will then be integrated with             experimental and theoretical models developed by the principal                  investigator to         elucidate further the geochemical cycle of              boron.",
