 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the many software engineering concepts developed to increase              programmer productivity, one of the most promising and most sought              after is reuse of existing, proven software.  A general program, also           referred to as the \"archetyped source\", can be adapted to a broad               spectrum of specific situations.  An example is a program for multi-            sensor integration, which can be instantiated for various combinations          of actual types of sensors.                                                                                                                                     Ada and other high-level languages offer abstractions for writing               general forms of programs; these are intended to be used by the                 programmer to adapt the program on a case-by-case basis.  In this               proposal, we show how a \"tailoring\" system can utilize abstractions in          the programming language; it also allows the designer to formulate              other abstractions in a metanotation for describing the general program         and its specific forms.  Thus the notion of an \"archetyped source\" can          be quite powerful in the context of the derivation of application-              specific \"actual sources\" from it.                                                                                                                              During the course of the Phase I project, they will use some existing           application-specific software that AKM Associates built for the Federal         Aviation Administration (FAA), define \"archetyped source\" version of it         and the appropriate metanotation for generating actual source.",
