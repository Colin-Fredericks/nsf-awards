 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cryptostome bryozoans were colonial organisms that abounded                in the world's oceans during the Paleozoic Era, and they left a                 significant fossil record in limestones of that age.  Dr. Daniel                Blake proposes to use state-of-the-art approaches to the analysis               of shape and shape change in a study of their diversity and                     evolution through time.  Microcomputer-based image analysis                     equipment will be used to quantify organic shape at the level of                individual organisms and whole colonies, allowing novel insight                 into patterns of growth.  In addition, Dr. Blake will be the                    first to use series of two-dimensional images of bryozoan                       colonies to reconstruct and manipulate three-dimensional                        structures, from which new details of morphology can be drawn.                  These new classes of morphometric data will form the basis of                   systematic revisions, and an analysis of evolutionary                           relationships within the Cryptostomata and among the other                      Paleozoic orders of bryozoans.                                                       The proposed research will clarify our understanding of an                 important group of extinct invertebrates, and will produce a more               consistent and objective basis on which more theoretical studies                of evolution and extinction can rest.  The proposed methods will                break new ground, and will set a new standard for systematic and                evolutionary studies of fossil bryozoans.",
