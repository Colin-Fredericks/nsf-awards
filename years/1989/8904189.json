 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of hydrogen isotopic fractionations during its incorporation          into plant biomass may have important applications in plant                     biochemistry, physiology, physiological ecology and several other               fields.  Of particular interest in this proposal is the deuterium               enrichment observed in non-exchangeable hydrogens of cellulose from CAM         plants.  Evidence is presented showing that biochemical reactions are           responsible for this deuterium enrichment.  The objective of the                experiments outlined in this proposal is to determine which metabolic           pathway is responsible for deuterium enrichment in CAM plants.  Whole           plant and tissue culture experiments are proposed here.  The results of         these experiments will determine whether deuterium enrichment can occur         during the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis cycle found in CAM plants.  An            increased knowledge of the processes responsible for deuterium                  enrichment in CAM plants will be significant in the study of                    carbohydrate pools and source sink relations.  More broadly, the results        of this study will have important applications in the study of                  photosynthetic systems in relation to environmental parameters.",
