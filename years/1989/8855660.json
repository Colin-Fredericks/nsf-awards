 "awd_abstract_narration": "Delineating the nature of conceptual understanding and its development          is a fundamental problem for science education research.  Toward this           end, the project will conduct a one-year empirical investigation of the         knowledge that individuals have about a central topic in physics:               simple harmonic motion (shm).  The research will include four groups of         subjects, ranging from high school students to physics professors, so           that relevant cross-sectional comparisons at different levels of                knowledge about shm can be made.  The research design will use                  structured interviews with a systematically formulated set of questions         that explore the major relations of shm and its application to                  particular physical systems.  The Principal Investigator will attempt to        characterize the psychological organization of knowledge that underlies         a person's conceptual understanding about shm.  This underlying                 knowledge includes the ability to reason about a variety of physical            systems involving (or appearing to involve) shm, using a range of               techniques and representations.  The relevant components of this                knowledge have already been identified from a rational analysis of the          kinds of skills needed for competent performance.  The cross-sectional          description of individuals' different levels of knowledge concerning shm        will form the basis of inferences about the processes involved                  in developing the ability to reason about shm.",
