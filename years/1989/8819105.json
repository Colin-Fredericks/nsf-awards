 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will develop two new strategies to visualize structural               interrelationships between integral membrane proteins and                       adjacent elements on the true surfaces of membranes by electron                 microscopy.  The first strategy produces a composite replica                    which allows simultaneous visualization of intramembrane                        particles in a freeze-fracture replica and related surface                      elements in a superimposed replica of the freeze-dried membrane                 surface.  The second strategy utilizes freeze-substitution                      methods to fix and dehydrate freeze-fracture replicas and                       membrane associated elements.  By infiltrating these thin samples               with a layer of resin we will obtain \"en face\" views of surface                 elements with respect to intramembrane structures without                       subjecting samples to freeze-drying.  The value of these methods                will be tested in studies of red cell ghosts and cultured muscle                cells.  This will allow a direct structural assessment of                       connections that cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix elements                 have to integral membrane proteins.  Combined with antibody                     probes that allow the identification of specific components,                    these methods promise to provide important insights into the                    organization of differentiated membrane domains in a variety of                 cell types.                                                                                                                                                     External signals are received by cells at the external surface of               the plasma membrane, and information about the signal is                        transmitted to the cell interior where biochemical and structural               changes carry out the cell's response.  The development of                      improved techniques for visualization of the detailed structure,                organization and composition of cell surface molecules and the                  connection of surface molecules with intracellular skeletal                     structures will contribute substantially to understanding of the                molecular basis of membrane physiology and transmembrane                        signalling.",
