 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first and primary goal of the Department of Mathematics and                 Computer Science at Spelman College is the production of quality female         scientists and engineers.  In order to accomplish this goal, a strong           research component for academic programs must be built in computer              science and applied mathematics.  Although Spelman is primarily a               teaching institution, they propose to increase the percentage of                students involved in research or realistic practical experiences to at          least seventy percent of the upper division students (i.e., juniors and         seniors) over the next five years.  This requires the development of a          faculty of adequate size for the student population with strong                 research and teaching capabilities.  The current faculty size is four           full-time members.                                                                                                                                              Second, they will develop a computer science program which meets the            Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) guidelines for accreditation.                                                                                          Third, they will increase the percentage of students in computer                science with an interest in scientific applications through systematic          exposure of these students to scientific careers and involvement in             appropriate science related activities.                                                                                                                         Fourth, they intend to separate the mathematics and computer science            programs by creating a new Department of Computer Science to house the          newly accredited program.  To accomplish these objectives, Spelman              propose a planning grant (1) improve and expand research efforts in             progress in the areas of image processing, and information storage and          retrieval; (2) increase the number of courses in Computer and                   Information Science which have laboratory components; (3) study and             modify the curriculum as necessary and desirable to meet the                    accreditation standards of ACM; (4) expand the course offerings in              Applied Mathematics to include relevant topics and techniques for image         processing; (5) recruit additional faculty in Computer Science and              Applied Mathematics with research interests and performance in the              selected areas; and (6) expose students to governmental and industrial          environments in which scientific applications of the discipline occur.",
