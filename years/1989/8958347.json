 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heat and mass transfer in fluid-solid flows encompasses many                    engineering disciplines from handling and processing of                         granular material to chemical synthesis using packed and                        fluidized beds.  Though petrochemical, process, and energy                      industries have extensively used these technologies, models                     governing the bulk fluid-solid transport rates are based                        largely on empirical data.  To simplify the analysis the                        fluid-solid systems are often viewed as macroscopically                         homogeneous; however, on the microscopic or pore level, the                     medium consists of a random distribution of individual                          particles in a surrounding fluid.  The pore-level transport                     depends on the bed structure, frequency of the particle                         collisions, heat, mass and momentum exchange between the                        particles and fluid, and interactions with bounding surfaces.                                                                                                   Though exact descriptions incorporating these local or                          microscopic effects appear inextricable, the current efforts                    focus on understanding the local mechanisms with the intent of                                                                                                  furthering development of the industrially-important                            macroscopic relations.  The planned analytical and                              experimental research will investigate transport in the bulk                    and in the boundary regions of the particle flows.  In the                      bulk region, the overall flow appears uniform, but locally the                                                                                                  individual particles rotate and translate laterally.  This                      local motion increases the cross-stream heat and mass                           diffusion and yields higher transport rates.  Near a bounding                                                                                                   surface, the particles are not uniformly distributed but                        contact the surface at distinct points causing a near-wall                      alignment of particles.  The distribution depends on the                        surface conditions of the wall, the type of particle, and the                                                                                                   flow rate and affects the velocity profile, molecular                           diffusivity and local particle convection.                                                                                                                      The work performed with this PYI grant will emphasize                           fluid-solid transport involving heat and mass transfer in                       contact-dominated granular flows.  This field has many                          industrial applications in energy, process, and food                            industries, and also combines aspects of the simpler fixed-bed                                                                                                  problems with the more complex moving- particle flows.  These                                                                                                   aspects of granular flows are poorly understood and yet they                    comprise the mechanisms that govern the heat, mass and                          momentum transport.  Continued research in these areas will                     advance the modeling of granular material flows and may lead                    to other fluid-solid research areas such as fluidized beds and                                                                                                  suspension flows.",
