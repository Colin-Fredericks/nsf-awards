 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within Europe, the histories of mass democracy and the mass party are           inextricably linked.  Mass parties arose to mobilize and integrate into         the political system previously disenfranchised segments of society,            and to generate and channel pressure for even wider inclusion in                democratic politics.  Parties were disciplined organizations able to            claim both roots in society and a popular mandate in government.                Observers from Max Weber to Maurice Duverger described the mass party           as the party of the future and argued that they were the inevitable             byproduct of, and necessary precondition for, mass democracy.                                                                                                   This view was based on the complementarity of two long-term trends:             the growth of public services and the state, and the expansion of               popular participation in politics as organized and encouraged by mass           parties.  It was also rooted in a highly stratified and segmented               social structure.  In recent years, the complementarity between the two         trends has been becoming unstuck:  parties are less dependent on their          members, while citizens are dependent on parties.  As well, European            societies are less simply structured, weakening one basis of party              loyalty and organization.                                                                                                                                       How have parties adapted to these changes?  Conventional wisdom                 suggests a trend towards parties that are externally financed, staffed          by professional officials, and led by career politicians; towards               parties whose primary orientation is external rather than internal.  In         many respects, this is to suggest that European parties are becoming            more like those in America, instead of the reverse as the older                 theories suggested.                                                                                                                                             Despite the potential importance of these trends for the character of           democratic government, little systematic research has been directed at          gathering data on party organizations in Western democracies.  This             project attends to this deficiency by gathering data on organizational          development in more than sixty political parties in twelve European             countries.  Through this research the investigators will accumulate,            for the first time, systematic cross-national evidence on what is               taking place in these key political organizations.  Are they becoming           more self-sufficient?  Is decision-making becoming more centralized?            Is mass-membership in decline, and are the parties increasingly                 divorced from their community roots?  Is this still the century of the          mass political party?  These are but a few of the questions that this           database will allow scholars to address.",
