Morphological variability in diagnostic                   cell-wall features will be examined by light- and electron-                     microscopy in conjunction with statistical analyses.  Reliable                  identification of diatom species will facilitate both basic                     taxonomic classification as well as stratigraphic interpretation                of geological sediments, thus benefitting oil company geologists                and paleontologists.                                                                 Diatoms are among the most widespread and ecologically                     important plants in the world, despite their small size.  They                  contribute significantly to photosynthesis in lakes and oceans as               well as to geochemical cycling of silicon, a constituent of their               cell walls.  These siliceous cell walls accumulate in dense                     fossil deposits, providing unique opportunities to assess the                   record of evolutionary origins and extinctions in a major lineage               of plants.  Dr. Theriot's work thus provides insight concerning                 the linkage between climatic events and evolutionary changes                    during recent Earth history.",
