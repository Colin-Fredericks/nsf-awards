 "awd_abstract_narration": "A problem at the heart of physics persistently refuses to go               away:  What happens to spacetime at big bang and in the                         gravitational collapse at the center of a black hole, both of                   them times beyond which -- according to physics as now understood               -- there is no time?  The present work seeks to capitalize on                   this difficulty; to turn it into opportunity to win new insight                 into the foundations of physics.  Tools to do this will include:                (1) the classical dynamics of geometry as seen in the initial-                  value formulation of J. W. York, (2) the quantum version of this                dynamics as seen in the usual WDW equation, (3) the quantum                     theory of measurement as it tells what about the predicted                      dynamics makes sense and what does not and (4) the translation of               questions and findings from and into the information-theoretical                language of bit counts.",
