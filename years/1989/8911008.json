A professor of Chemistry at Columbia University, Still is                       studying how to prepare and computer-model structures and                       reactions of complex organic molecules.  His work has already                   had impact on how chemists design and analyze molecular                         structure, and his studies continue to lead the way in this                     very important area.                                                                                                                                            The objectives of this project are: 1) to prepare a series of                   conformationally restricted host molecules with three-                          dimensional binding sites, 2) to study their geometries and                     binding properties with guest molecules, and 3) to use the data                 obtained to test and evaluate a computational method for                        predicting binding properties.",
