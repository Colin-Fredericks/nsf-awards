 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Herbert Haas, Director of the Radiocarbon Laboratory at                     Southern Methodist University's Institute for the Study of Earth                and Man, will purchase a low level background liquid                            scintillation counter.  The \"Quantulus\" will permit increases in                both the productivity and precision of the laboratory and permit                the dating of both older and smaller samples than is now                        possible.                                                                                                                                                       In the last half decade radiocarbon dating has been                             revolutionized by the application of a direct counting                          accelerator technique.  However problems entailed by this                       approach have also become apparent.  Sample costs are high and                  waiting time is long.  Dr. Haas has demonstrated that traditional               liquid scintillation counting, using a state of the art machine                 will combine the advantages of accelerator dating with lower cost               and shorter turnaround time.  He plans to use this machine to                   examine the issue of the emergence of anatomically modern humans                and will date several sites in Europe and the Near East which                   document this transition.                                                                                                                                       Radiocarbon dating is crucial to archaeological research and Dr.                Haas has developed a first rate laboratory which has analyzed                   archaeologically important samples.  The addition of a high                     precision liquid scintillation counter will increase his                        contribution as well as permit him to address important specific                problems.  It will also provide a test case for the utility of                  the machine.",
