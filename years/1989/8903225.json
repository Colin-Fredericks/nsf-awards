 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Algebraic Geometry of                  Professor Janos Kollar of the University of Utah. Dr Kollar plans               to work in the rapidly developing field of minimal models for                   threefolds and algebraic varieties of higher dimension than                     three. He will also use the new results of Mori on minimal models               to look for new applications in the theory of algebraic surfaces                and the deformation theory of surface singularities.                                 This is research in the field of Algebraic Geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from Algebra, but from Analysis and               Topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical Computer Science and in Robotics.",
