The research will focus on photo-induced electron transfer in                   organized assemblies and the subsequent reactions of the                        photo-produced cations.                                                                                                                                         The techniques used will be laser flash photolysis, where the                   ionic events are initiated by short, intense flashes of light,                  and the short-lived radicals and cations produced are monitored                 by fast absorption and emission spectroscopy and conduction                     methods.  Long-lived products will be monitored by conventional                 analytical methods such as NMR, IR and electronic spectroscopy                  and HPLC and gas chromatography. The research will explore                      methods of generation of cations, solvent effects on the                        reactions of the cations, methods of increasing charge                          separation or decreasing back reaction, photoinduced electron                   transfer in onium salts, use of conducting polymers in the                      charge separation process, new host systems, and photodynamics                  in polymer films.",
