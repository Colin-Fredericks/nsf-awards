 "awd_abstract_narration": "In June 1988, 20 nations (including the USA) negotiated and signed a            Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities.          Each nation is now considering ratification of the convention.  If              ratified by 16 of the 20 signing nations, the convention will govern            exploration for and exploitation of antarctic minerals.  Currently no           mechanism is in place to govern such activities.  In the USA,                   ratification requires consent by a two-thirds vote in the Senate and            approval by the President.                                                                                                                                      The proposal is to design and conduct a workshop at the Keystone                Center concerning the implementation of the convention.  The workshop           will examine the convention in light of its potential ratification and          implementation in the United States.  The dialog will enable interested         groups to interact with involved Federal agencies and to discuss the            impacts of implementation.  Included will be evaluation of the                  likelihood of future mineral development in Antarctica, assessment of           the potential difficulties and environmental concerns related to                antarctic mineral resource development, and identification of possible          new responsibilities for Federal agencies.  The goal will be to                 promote communication and information exchange between interested               groups and Federal agencies as the agencies begin to consider                   strategies to implement the minerals regime.  The Keystone Center will          prepare and distribute a report.                                                                                                                                A steering committee shall set the agenda for the workshop and decide           upon the participants.  The steering committee shall be made up of              eight people consisting of four Federal agency employees representing           agencies involved in the development of the convention and/or                   implementation legislation and four non-Federal persons representing            groups having interests in the outcome of any Federal legislation               concerning the convention.  The four Federal agencies represented shall         be National Science Foundation, Department of State, Department of              Interior (Minerals Management Service) and Department of Commerce               (NOAA).  The eight committee members will be develop the agenda and             list of invitees to the workshop on a consensus basis.                                                                                                          The Keystone Center, a nonprofit organization founded in 1975, has a            proved record of providing neutral fora for policy formulation in the           areas of natural resources, science, technology, and health.  Robert W.         Craig, its founder and president, manages its two major programs in             science and public policy and science school development.  His                  background also includes industrial design and planning, humanistic             studies, and leadership of expeditions to some of the world's highest           mountains.  Recently, he served on the National Science Foundation's            U.S. Antarctic Program Safety Review Panel.  He has a master's degree           in philosophy.  Mr. Craig will direct the workshop.  Michael T. Lesnick         conducts training in conflict management and has taught natural                 resource conflict management theory.  He holds a Ph.D. in natural               resource policy and environmental dispute resolution.  Dr. Lesnick will         be co-director of the workshop.",
