 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Grabiner will continue his research on analytic                  extensions of the umbral calculus, on weighted convolution                      algebras, and on Banach algebras of power series and their                      analogues. Umbral and Sheffer shifts, investigated by Rota in the               algebraic setting of polynomials, will be looked at for spaces of               entire functions. The work on convolution algebras will                         concentrate on homomorphisms, convolution semigroups, and closed                ideals. For radical Banach algebras of power series, Grabiner                   will study the structure of such algebras without assumptions of                regularity of growth of the weights, and try to relate                          computationally feasible conditions on the weights to the                       structure of the algebras.                                                           One fairly concrete setting for the mathematical research to               be undertaken in this project is that of power series, which may                be thought of as polynomials of infinite degree. Many familiar                  functions such as sine and exp, which are called entire, have                   power series representations valid throughout the complex plane,                and it is often reasonable to treat such functions as a species                 of extended polynomial. In another direction, one can form Banach               algebras of power series by placing an appropriate constraint on                the limit behavior of the coefficients. It may happen that the                  only way to evaluate all of the series in the algebra is by                     taking the constant term. In this case, one has a radical Banach                algebra, a very exotic object whose understanding is one of the                 goals of Professor Grabiner's research.",
