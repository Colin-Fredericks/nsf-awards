 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance of dynamic seals depends on the local liquid                    pressure between the two sliding surfaces.  By controlling the                  local surface topography it is possible to control the fluid                    pressure on a micro scale.  In this project patterns of surface                 topography are created by differential wear of various segments                 of the surface which have been treated to have different                        properties to some depth or to have different surface roughness.                Results from Phase I of this study show that the concept is                     feasible.  In the current phase a theoretical model will be                     developed for differential wear and the resulting fluid pressure                development and experiments will be conducted on a number of                    surface modification processes as means to develop the                          differential wear patterns which give optimal seal performance.",
