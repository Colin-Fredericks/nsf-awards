 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the United States, the University of Arizona has pioneered               Tandem Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (TAMS) radiocarbon dating.                 This technique is important to archaeologists and other                         scientists because it permits extremely small samples to be                     measured.  Dr. Long's laboratory is responsible for preparing                   samples for both the TAMS and conventional beta counting                        machines.  With an additional three years of support, this                      laboratory will both continue its own research and provide a                    service function to the user community.  It will pursue a series                of specialized research projects.  The laboratory has developed                 techniques for extracting and purifying organic components from                 bone.  Such samples have been shown to give reliable TAMS dates.                This focus on bone work will continue.  Emphasis will also be                   placed on dating early cultigens from North America to elucidate                the prehistoric development of agriculture.                                                                                                                     Dating is crucial in archaeological research, and the development               of TAMS technique has provided a major breakthrough because of                  relaxed sample size requirements.  Many new questions could be                  addressed and many have been answered because of the Arizona                    work.  In the process it has become clear that a major problem                  lies in sample preparation; dates can be no better than the                     samples placed in the machine.  Dr. Long's laboratory has made                  and continues to make major strides in this area.                                                                                                               This project is important because it provides a basic and                       necessary service not only to archaeologists but also to                        scientists working in a wide range of disciplines.",
