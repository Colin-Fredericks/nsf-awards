 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program supports the work of Prof. Mark                   Welker.  Welker, of Wake Forest University, is involved in the                  preparation and chemical behavior of unique complexes that                      contain  trapped disulfur monoxide.  These complexes are made                   up of carbon-containing compounds attached to metals.  Although                 interesting in their own right, these novel complexes can be                    used to develop synthetic strategies for preparing a host of                    important sulfur-containing materials.  Many important                          bioactive compounds contain sulfur as part of their structure                   and have been interesting challenges to laboratory preparation.                 Standard and general methods are not available to address the                   synthesis problems, and Welker's program is addressing this                     need.                                                                                                                                                           The goals of this project are to  1) trap and stabilize                         disulfur monoxide with transition metal complexes; and  2) make                 use of these complexes in efficient syntheses of organosulfur                   compounds.  The approaches to be developed are general and                      should find wide application.  This is important since a number                 of pharmacologically significant sulfur-containing compounds                    might be addressed by the new protocols.  In its own right, the                 preparation, characterization and study of basic coordination                   chemistry of disulfur monoxide will provide a range of                          fundamental knowledge.",
