 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal by a young investigator of unusual breadth of expertise           spans several levels of biological organization.  The basic interest of         the PI is in the biology of muscle and, more particularly, how the              membrane system within muscle cells controls the contraction/relaxation         cycle of muscles.  In ordinary striated muscle, ie, those that contract         to produce movement, these membranes serve as storage depots for                calcium ions.  The release /sequestration of calcium ions in the                membranous system of such muscle cells regulates their contraction.             The PI is examining the coupling of these calcium mechanisms to the             impulse generated by nerves which initiates the contractile event.  To          do so she employs a unique muscle cell found in the eye muscles of              deep-diving fish such as the marlin, that is, a muscle cell that does           not contract but rather produces heat.  This \"heater tissue\" is used to         warm blood on its way to the fish's brain, thus keeping the brain warm          even while the fish dives in deep and cold water.                                                                                                               The PI is currently studying the elaborate counter-current heat                 exchange system at the base of this heater organ, using biochemical and         morphological methodologies to study how these cells regulate the               movement of calcium and thereby generate heat.  Using a unique, non-            contracting muscle system the PI will also be addressing questions of           interest to all contractile physiologists.",
