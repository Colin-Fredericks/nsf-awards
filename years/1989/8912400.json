 "awd_abstract_narration": "The etching properties of silicon carbide (SiC) are of interest                 in two distinct technologies.  First, its electrical properties                 make it a promising semiconductor for integrated circuit (IC)                   devices for high temperature operation.  Second, its resistance                 to radiation  damage and to attack by atomic hydrogen have                      prompted active consideration of SiC as a protective liner for                  plasma-facing components of fusion reactors.  Therefore there is                both chemical and nuclear engineering interest in this material.                                                                                                The objectives of the proposed research are to determine the                    conditions under which silicon carbide is etched by reactive                    gases (hydrogen, fluorine, and chlorine atoms) and to determine                 the mechanism of the surface reactions responsible for etching.                 Etching condition refer top the nature of the gaseous reactant,                 its pressure, the SiC temperature and the intensity and energy of               energetic ions impinging on the reacting surface.  This problem                 will be approached using a high-pressure (up to 1 Torr) rf plasma               reactor and a low-pressure (up to 0.0001 Torr) molecular beam                   reactor.  The problem is attacked at two levels.  The first is a                fundamental mechanistic study using the molecular beam-mass                     spectrometric method.  The second is by plasma etching in a                     reactor representative of realistic integrated-circuit                          production.  The molecular beam technique provides information                  ont he molecular nature of reaction products and their residence                times on the surface.  Such data can be use to elucidate the                    elementary reactions occurring on the surface and the kinetics of               each of these steps.  In order to take full advantage of the                    fundamental mechanistic information provided by the molecular                   beam method, it is necessary to relate these experiments to                     etching studies carried out at pressures normally used to                       fabricate ICs.  This connection will be accomplished by                         performing etching studies in an rf glow-discharge reactor which                is capable of both downstream atom etching and direct plasma                    etching.  Comparison of etching results from these two discharge                modes can provide insight into the role of the plasma in etch                   processes and will also link the mechanistic molecular beam                     results to etching under conditions of technological utility.",
