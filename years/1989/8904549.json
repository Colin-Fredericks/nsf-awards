 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pathway for purine biosynthesis has been detected in                        plastids which suggests that the genes for purine synthesis                     may be of prokaryotic or eukaryotic origin.  Also,                              preliminary evidence suggests that there may be isozymes of                     the purine synthesis reactions.  None of the enzymes of                         purine synthesis have been purified to homogeneity from a                       plant source.  Soybean root nodules are an excellent model                      system for the study of purine synthesis in plants because                      these organs assimilate fixed nitrogen into the ureides,                        allantoin and allantoic acid, via purine synthesis.  As a                       result, the purine synthesis pathway is highly expressed in                     nodules compared to other plant organs.  These experiments                      address several important problems of purine synthesis in                       plants.  Two enzymes of purine synthesis from nodules,                          glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase and aminoimidazole                    ribonucleotide synthetase, will be purified and                                 characterized.  These enzymes catalyze the third and fifth                      committed steps, respectively, of purine synthesis.  Using                      immunochemical and enzymatic assays, the distribution of                        these enzymes will be determined at the subcellular,                            cellular, and whole plant levels.%%%                                                                                                                            Little is known about purine synthesis in plants despite its                    importance in nitrogen metabolism.  The production of ureides                   which are derived from purine synthesis is part of the                          process of supplying leaves and stems with nitrogen source                      they require.  These studies will characterize two of the                       enzymes of the purine biosynthesis pathway as well as examine                   the expression and location of the genes responsible for                        purine synthesis.  This research will provide a better                          understanding of nitrogen nutrition in plants.***//",
