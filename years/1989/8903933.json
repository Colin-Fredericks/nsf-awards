 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intercellular gap junctional channels facilitate the transfer of                ions and small molecules, and this form of cell-cell                            communication is crucial to normal development of the vertebrate                embryo. The aim of this proposal is to study gap junction                       biosynthesis and the developmental role of gap junctional                       communication in vertebrate embryogenesis, using as a model                     system the frog Xenopus laevis. Messenger RNAs that may encode a                small family of distinct gap junctional subunits are present                    during oogenesis and early development in this organism. The                    channel forming properties of these gene products will be                       investigated. The spatial and temporal patterns of abundance of                 the gap junction mRNAs and their protein products will be                       determined. Tests of the developmental functions of gap                         junctional communication will involve specific destruction of                   mRNAs in vivo, direct interruption of communication among cells                 in defined embryonic lineages, and attempts to perturb                          biosynthesis of new embryonic gap junction proteins with                        \"antisense\" RNA. Developmental abnormalities resulting from such                treatments will be interpreted in the light of clonal analysis of               cell fate changes in treated embryos.                                           %%%                                                                             The results of this study will shed light on basic modes of cell-               cell signalling during embryonic pattern formation and may                      suggest explanation of common defects in the early development of               vertebrates.",
