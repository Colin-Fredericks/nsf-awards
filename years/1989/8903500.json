 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oscillatory zoning has been observed in crystals of a                      variety of minerals grown under a range of conditions -                         diagenetic, metamorphic, and igneous.  Such undulatory zoning has               often been attributed to corresponding, externally imposed                      variations in the growth environment.  However, it has been shown               via mathematical reaction-transport modeling that oscillation may               arise spontaneously from the kinetics of grain growth coupled to                transport of components in the medium from which the grain grows.               The genesis of oscillatory zoning in pyroxene grown in magmas                   will be investigated using a combined ion probe and modeling                    approach.  The zoning profiles contain a wealth of data which                   will be interpreted via equations of crystal growth and component               migration in the melt.  Model parameters will be constrained via                available grain growth experimental data and the detailed zoning                profiles.                                                                            Developing a model capable of explaining oscillatory zoning                will, in addition, give a more reliable tool for analyzing common               crystallization phenomena.  Because zoning of various types                     should occur in well defined ranges of growth conditions, the                   results also can be used to interpret the geologic record.",
