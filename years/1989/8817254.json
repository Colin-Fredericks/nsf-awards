 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emplacement of basaltic feeder dikes in limestone at Killala Bay                produced grossular- and wollastonite-bearing assemblage in the                  aureoles of small (1.5 and 5.3m) dikes and in the outer aureole                 of a 50m dike, which has very high temperature assemblages in its               inner aureole and which has assimilated limestone along its                     contact.  Numerical modelling of the thermal histories of these                 aureoles allows them to be used as natural experiments from which               kinetic parameters for the coarsening of calcite, wollastonite                  and quartz can be recovered.  Pressure, temperature, fluid                      composition and fluid/rock ratio in the aureoles will be                        determined using stratigraphy, mineral assemblages and                          compositions, and thermochemical and reaction-progress                          calculations for buffer assemblages so that a numerical thermal                 history model involving multiple episodes of feeder flow,                       magmatic crystallization and cooling can be calibrated.  Measured               grain-size distributions will be use to distinguish the                         coarsening mechanisms of Ostwald ripening and normal grain                      growth, and the variation of the mean grain size with distance                  from the contact will be used to retrieve material constants and                activation energies for grain growth.  This work will \"calibrate\"               the natural laboratory for the analysis of the kinetics of                      wollastonite and grossular nucleation and annealing of quartz                   dislocations in future studies.",
