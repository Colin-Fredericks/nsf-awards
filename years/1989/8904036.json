 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides one-half the funds required to purchase                a computer workstation system to be installed and maintained in                 the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard                       University. The University is committed to providing the                        remaining funds required.                                                                                                                                            The workstation and associated hardware are to be used                     primarily by the Principal Investigator, Joann Stock, and her                   graduate students in their research projects in structural                      geology and plate tectonics. The PI's research is focussed on                   plate reconstructions (including their uncertainties and their                  tectonic implications) and on geologic mapping of structures                    indicative of plate boundary deformations in the geologic record.               The work requires detailed analysis of large magnetic,                          bathymetric and geoid data sets, as well as the compilation and                 printing of maps, all of which will require intensive use of the                workstation.",
