 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rates of woody debris movement downstream will be compared among                four streams in Coweeta Experimental Forest (a site operated by                 the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service).  These will               then be compared with analogous results from a pair of streams in               Puerto Rigo's Luquillo Experimental Forest.  The locations of                   marked (tagged) wood added to headwaters of these tributary                     streams are to be mapped after major rainfall events in order to                determine how quantity and sizes of these pieces influence their                downstream movement.  The greater amont and diversity of sizes of               wood expected in streams meandering through older forests will                  more often lead to formation of debris dams, which decrease water               flow rates and increase retention of leaf litter within the                     stream, thereby altering physico-chemical conditions of the                     stream.  Such differences have a profound influence on the                      species composition and abundances of benthic community members.                                                                                                A major component of this study is the application of                           Geographical Information System (GIS) technology to record                      sequential changes in positions of natural and added woody                      debris.  Some of the GIS software being developed will be used to               simulate movement of materials downstream in natural catchment                  basins by using digital data on topography, elevation, and slope.               This methodology has been developed to manipulate digitized data                available from remotely sensed (aircraft and satellite) imagery.                The capacity to store and handle large comparative data sets is                 finding wide use in ecological studies but has not yet been                     applied to analysis of detrital materials.  Dr. Alan P. Covich,                 of the University of Oklahoma, will devote twelve months of Mid-                Career Fellowship in Environmental Biology tenure to this                       research.  The host institution is the University of Georgia.",
