 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 2.5-year project will develop a school-based model for improving           mathematics instruction in grades K-8.  A total of 65 elementary and            middle school teachers in Brooklyn will participate in a program that           combines instruction in mathematics content and methodology, in-school          support, mathematics field trips, and citywide Math Forums.  During the         first year, forty teachers from four schools will take an academic-year         mathematics course that will implicitly model sound pedagogical strategy        and an education course that explicitly examines such teaching                  techniques.  During the summer, 20 of the teachers (designated as \"math         enthusiasts\") will take an additional three-week course in mathematics          content.  During the second year, the mathematics and education courses         will be offered to 25 more teachers from two additional schools, while          the twenty \"math enthusiasts\" take a course in leadership skills.  The          latter will serve as leaders in mathematics education in their schools          and districts.                                                                                                                                                  Project staff will visit each participating school once a week.                 In addition, the project will sponsor \"Math Forums\" addressing various          aspects of mathematics instruction, publish a newsletter, and prepare           resource packets for two mathematics field trips.  Evaluation will              include assessment of the participants' knowledge of and attitude               towards mathematics and observations by the                                     project staff.                                                                                                                                                  Brooklyn College is contributing in cost-sharing an amount equal                to 110% of the NSF award.",
