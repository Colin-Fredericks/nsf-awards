 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is a major effort in analyzing,                            synthesizing, and interpreting results of research in mathematics               education for practitioners.  Outstanding interpretive research                 specialists will work with classroom teachers to write chapters                 for three volumes of implications of research in mathematics                    education, one volume at each of three levels -- early                          childhood/primary, intermediate/middle school, and                              high school/post secondary.  Areas of mathematics education                     research to be reviewed include content topics, process topics,                 teaching strategies, and student variables.  A team of three                    editors will work closely with the chapter co-authors to insure                 comprehensive coverage of topics and uniform clarity of writing                 style.  An advisory board of practitioners and researchers will                 oversee the project and assist in structuring the three volumes.                Research specialists and teacher consultants will review each                   chapter of the written materials for accuracy, completeness,                    readability, and practicality.  The project advisory board will                 review the total, revised manuscripts for comprehensiveness and                 coordination of topic coverage.  A team of outside evaluators                   will review the final manuscripts prior to publication.  It is                  expected that the three volumes will be available for                           dissemination by the summer of 1991.  The proposed set of                       books will constitute a comprehensive interpretation of current                 mathematics education research for practitioners and an                         up-to-date research reference for anyone interested in                          mathematics education.                                                                                                                                          Joint support of this project is being provided by the Division                 of Teacher Preparation and Enhancement and the Division of                      Materials Development, Research and Informal  Science Education.",
