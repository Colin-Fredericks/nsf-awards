 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanical parts have traditionally been designed by having a designer          or engineer create detailed drawings of the part, then having a                 craftsmen create a physical prototype.  The prototype is subsequently           evaluated based on its mechanical (and possibly aesthetic) qualities.           The results of this evaluation are then fed back to the designer, often         in the form of suggested modifications to the part.  The construction           and evaluation of prototypes is extremely expensive, so the cost of             design can be dramatically reduced if the number of physical prototypes         can be minimized.  This has largely been achieved by using computers            (i.e., solid modeling systems) in the design of certain types of                mechanical parts.  However, there is a class of increasingly important          design applications, including the design of automobile bodies, ship            hulls, and airplane fuselages, that have not seen great benefits from           solid modeling systems.  These applications are characterized by their          need for compact, efficient, and robust representations of smoothly             varying shapes.                                                                                                                                                 This research is concerned with providing a better understanding of the         problems and solutions of designing shapes containing smooth elements.          The use of \"free-form\" curves and surfaces has shown promise for smooth         design applications, but their use has been hindered for at least two           reasons: conceptual complexity and robustness.  The issue of conceptual         complexity stems from the fact that current techniques typically                require a great deal of mathematical expertise to use effectively.              Insufficient robustness is demonstrated by the fact that currently              popular techniques are applicable only in special geometrical                   situations (for instance, when all surface patches have exactly four            neighbors).                                                                                                                                                     The project is developing techniques to make free-form design systems           applicable in a wider variety of geometrical situations, and also               techniques that are more intuitive and natural for designers.  Such             systems would not only make free-form design accessible to                      mathematically unsophisticated designers, they would make                       mathematically proficient users more productive.",
