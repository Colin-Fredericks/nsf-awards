 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor J. C. Sprott of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Physics           Department, has delivered a series of public lectures on \"The Wonders of        Physics\" that has been very well received.  Under this grant, Professor         Sprott will produce a kit of materials designed to encourage and assist         physicists and physics teachers throughout the Nation to establish              programs similar to the \"Wonders of Physics\" in their own communities.          The kit will include the following items:                                                                                                                             1)  A \"How-to\" booklet motivating the concept and describing              logistical considerations involved in presentations to the public.                                                                                                    2)  A list of 80 suitable demonstrations.                                                                                                                       3)  A bibliography of references on physics demonstrations.                                                                                                     4)  A list of vendors of scientific demonstration equipment,              audiovisual materials, and computer software.                                                                                                                         5)  A sample videotape of a recent \"Wonders of Physics\"                   presentation.                                                                                                                                                         6)  Computer software suitable for lecture or museum use                  containing animations of ten physics demonstrations with written                documentation and an Instructor's manual.                                                                                                                             7)  A booklet entitled \"What the Heck Is Physics?\" that is                suitable as a handout at public lectures.                                                                                                                             8)  A leaflet describing at least five home experiments in                physics.                                                                                                                                                              9)  Samples of publicity materials and posters.                                                                                                           The availability of these kits will be advertised in physics journals           and through direct mailings to physics departments.  The kit will be            sold at modest cost; income will be invested in kit improvement and             maintenance.  A questionnaire will be sent to purchasers to evaluate the        effect of the kits in stimulating effective interactions between                physicists and the general public.",
