 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six (of seven) months of Mid-Career Fellowship in Environmental                 Biology tenure will be spent at Dalhousie University (Canada),                  enabling Dr. William R. Atchley of North Carolina State                         University to engage in a collaborative synthesis with                          Dr. Brian K. Hall and his group.  The effort will be to integrate               approaches of developmental biology with quantitative genetics;                 mammalian craniomandibular growth and morphogenesis will serve as               the paradigmatic focus of interest.  In particular, first                       Dr. Atchley will strive to acquire expertise in laboratory                      procedures pertinent to skeletal developmental biology, such as                 isolation and culture of skeletal tissue condensations, in order                to determine cellular architecture, relative rates of                           development, and temporal orchestration of events during                        ontogeny.  Secondly, he will elaborate on a previously developed                covariance matrix model by exploring in greater detail topics                   such as (1) the role of various developmental processes (e.g.,                  hyperplasia and hypertrophy) in generating genetic correlations                 among dissimilar traits, (2) the developmental origin of                        evolutionary constraints, (3) quantitative genetic aspects of                   heterochronic events during development, and (4) how epigenetic                 interactions can be incorproated into quantitative genetic                      models.  A final month of fellowship tenure will be spent at the                University of Edinburgh's (Scotland) Department of Genetics in                  Dr. William G. Hill's laboratory.",
