 "awd_abstract_narration": "The separation of cells is accomplished by subjecting the                  aqueous suspension containing cells to cross electric and                       magnetic fields.  These fields cause the cells to drift and the                 drift velocity is a complex function of cell structure, cell                    size and the operating conditions such as the strengths of and                  the phase shift between the two fields.  The feasibility of the                 technique has been successfully demonstrated in Phase I                         experiments, in which a latex and three mammalian cells were                    separated.  In this Phase-II project, flow systems will be                      constructed and tested, better resolutions for cell sorting                     will be obtained, and a theory will be established for                          predicting dependence of the cell drift velocity on the                         operating conditions as well as the structure and size of the                   cell.                                                                                Successful results from the project would lead to a new                    technique for cell sorting which is needed in medicine,                         biochemical and biomedical engineering operations.  This                        technique would be superior than electrophoresis in that it                     requires much lower electric fields.",
