 "awd_abstract_narration": "The EESIER Project provides thirty rising high school sophomores and            juniors with the opportunity to do research at the Marine Biological            Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA).  The research projects are                         interdisciplinary in nature and will focus on the physicochemical and           biological characteristics of a salt marsh and a small ocean cove.  The         research activities are complemented by training in writing and reading         scientific literature, the use of a research library, and statistics.           Students will also participate in a lecture-discussion series on the            history, philosophy, and ethics of science.  The academic program is            balanced by career counseling workshops offered by admissions personnel         and faculty from undergraduate and graduate programs.                                                                                                           The three-week residential project is sponsored by the Simon's Rock             College Institute for the Teaching of Mathematics and Science and the           Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL).  The first week is spent at Simon's         Rock.  Activities include an orientation period and intensive workshops         in the fundamentals of interdisciplinary approaches to research,                experimental design, statistics, writing and reading scientific                 literature, and a lecture-discussion program on the history of science.         The second and third week are spent at Woods Hole.  Activities include          two major research projects, continued training in statistics, training         in the use of library resources, intensive writing workshops, and a             lecture series on the philosophy and ethics of science.  Career                 counseling seminars or activities are scheduled for all three weeks of          the program.",
