 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Iowa proposes to enhance its established summer               research participation program in science and engineering for twelve            high school students to offset four identified needs: (1) the need to           involve industry as part of the learning component; (2) the desire to           openly recruit more minority and economically disadvantaged students;           (3) the desire to expand the impact of the program beyond the current           eight week course; and (4) the need to underpin the base of financial           support for the entire program beyond the period of proposed effort.                                                                                            The proposed target program seeks to augment the existing program               through (1) the active recruitment of minority and economically                 disadvantaged students in Iowa and Chicago; (2) the inclusion of                industry as an active partner in career awareness development and               program financial support; and (3) structured follow-up activities which        not only will impact on the target group and the eighty regular                 participants, but will also influence the participants' peers and their         home community.",
