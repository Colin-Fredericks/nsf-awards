 "awd_abstract_narration": "A technique allowing fully motile sperm to be studied in the               absence of an intact plasma membrane (\"sperm models\") will be                   used to study the chemical and mechanical events involved in                    flagellar movement.  Micromanipulation and microdissection of                   sperm cells will be conducted to explore the mechanical responses               of the intact flagellum and its isolated parts.  The importance                 of cyclic AMP and intracellular calcium in the sliding                          interaction between outer doublet microtubules of the axoneme                   will be explored.  The role of calcium in flagellar curvature                   will be examined to determine which component of the axoneme                    mediates the curvature and what role curvature may play in                      coordination of the beat cycle.  The effects of pH on cAMP                      dependent phosphorylation and calcium dependent dephosphorylation               of axoneme proteins will be investigated for possible biochemical               links between pH and sperm activity.  Finally, an explanation of                the events in a cycle of flagellar beating is proposed and                      experiments will be conducted to test this hypothesis.  In this                 proposed view, energy from the sliding tubule mechanism is stored               in calcium-regulated internal elastic elements of the axoneme.                  Recoil from release of the stored energy is used to power one                   stroke of the flagellar cycle and trigger the next cycle of                     microtubule sliding.                                                                                                                                            The objective of this project is to better understand the events                producing the rhythmic beating of a flagellum and the role of                   cyclic AMP and calcium in regulating this process.  These                       investigations are expected to enhance our knowledge of processes               that underlie motility in cilia and flagella.",
