 "awd_abstract_narration": "How hail is produced in deep convective storms has been                     studied for several years, but many questions still remain.  It                 is well-known that hailstones begin their growth around small                   ice particles which are referred to as hailstone embryos.                       Results over the last decade have drawn attention to an area in                 severe storms known as feeder cells.  These are small                           convective clouds that form near the main storm cell and                        eventually are absorbed (\"feed\") into the main convective cell.                 It is speculated that, at least in some types of hailstorms,                    these feeder cells are the main producers of the embryos that                   eventually grow into large hail.                                                    In conjunction with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric                    Administration, the National Science Foundation will                            participate in a field program to study hailstorms.  This                       project, known as the North Dakota Thunderstorm Project, will                   be held during the Summer of 1989.  As part of this research                    effort, the Principal Investigator intends to study two aspects                 of embryo production.  First, using in situ aircraft                            measurements, the microphysical characteristics of feeder cells                 will be investigated.  This will include experimental seeding                   with artificial ice nuclei in the feeder cells to investigate                   the effects of premature nucleation on microphysical processes.                                                                                                                                                                                 The second area of investigation will focus on a phenomenon                     known as fine scale reflectivity patterns.  These are areas of                  enhanced radar echo return and have been thought to be a source                 of hailstone embryos.  Through direct sensing, the Principal                    plans to investigate the hypothesis that these are indeed areas                 of high concentration of embryos and that these embryos often                   find their way into the regions of the storm where large hail                   is produced.                                                                     //",
