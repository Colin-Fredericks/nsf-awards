 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Minority Research Initiation award supports the                       research in algebraic geometry of Professor Ronald Biggers of                   Clark College. Dr. Biggers's project is to make a computer-aided                attack on a number of basic problems in the theory of moduli of                 algebraic curves. The results that he aims for are of consider-                 able interest and importance in themselves, but a byproduct of                  his work will be a package of routines for computing in group                   theory that will be of use to other mathematicians as well.                          This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one that has had a                  revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical computer science and in robotics.",
