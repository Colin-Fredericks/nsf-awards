 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project; Physics and Life: Summer Institutes for                            Secondary Science Teachers, proposes a series of intensive                      summer institutes for teachers of physics and life sciences,                    grades 8-12, to be held in 1989, 1990 and 1991.  They will                      combine science and the history of science, amplified by an                     intensive laboratory training.  Some  twenty candidates will                    be selected primarily from around Minnesota and the upper                       mid-west to participate in each institute and at least half                     of the spaces will be reserved for those teachers who will                      require room and board.                                                                                                                                         Teachers will repeat important historical experiments in                        order to understand the development of scientific concepts                      and the mutual enrichment in physics and biology.  Many of                      these experiments will be conducted with a simple and                           inexpensive apparatus and may be used by teachers as                            demonstrations or labs.  In each field, the historical study                    will culminate in modern biophysical experiment.  By                            incorporating parts of these courses into their school                          curricula teachers will demonstrate the links between                           different sciences and their practical applications; enhance                    their students' understanding of the scientific process,                        improve their experimental skills and problem-solving                           techniques, make learning more entertaining, and as a result                    increase the enrollment into science courses and improve                        students' proficiency in science.                                                                                                                               The 1989 institute will be on electricity and its                               applications to biology and medicine.  The course will be                       based on works and discoveries from Gray and Dufay, to                          Du Bois-Reymond, and Helmholtz.                                                                                                                                 The 1990 institute will focus on optics and vision.  The                        course will be based on works from Archimedes to Maxwell.                                                                                                       The 1991 institute will be on acoustics and hearing.  The                       discussion and experiments will be based on original works                      from Galileo to Helmholtz.  Cost-sharing is approximately 24%                   of the National Science Foundation request.",
