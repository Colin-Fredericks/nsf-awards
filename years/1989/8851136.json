These annual briefings, which have been                 conducted since 1963, bring together leading researchers in the most            active areas of science and engineering with science journalists to             educate journalists about the latest developments in scientific                 discovery and inquiry, and to allow the two groups to interact with             each other to discuss common aspects of the public understanding of             science.                                                                                                                                                        Each year, the CASW Briefings engage more than a hundred science                journalists from around the country with more than a dozen speakers             reflecting as many fields of scientific discovery.  The activities              cover all fields of science and engineering and are carefully                   constructed to reflect a variety of points of view within disciplines.                                                                                          This standard award for three years will allow CASW to develop                  independent long.term funding for the series.  Evaluation and marketing         studies will take place in each of the next four years.  More than              $100,000 in additional project support will be provided by the CASW and         other New Horizons sponsors.",
