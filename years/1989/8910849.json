 "awd_abstract_narration": "Healthy ventricular myocardium behaves much like a continuous uniform           excitable medium, despite its evident discontinuities of structure and          function on sub-mm and sub-msec scales.  On the basis of this analogy           and the corresponding numerical models it has been predicted that               myocardium should be vulnerable to a stimulus of certain phase and size         which induces reentry in the form of paired vortices in 2 dimensions and        vortex filaments in 3 dimensions, independent of the discontinuities and        heterogeneity that apparently make diseased tissue more vulnerable.             This and related consequences have now been confirmed by electrical             stimulation and high-resolution myocardial mapping.  The purposes for           the next support interval are (1) to explore the implications for 3-            dimensional vorticity, both numerically and in collaboration with               experimental physiologists, as before; (2) to examine these phenomena           through the interpretive lens of the best available electrophysiological        model of ventricular myocardial membrane; (3) to understand the                 development of reentrant tachycardias into fibrillation in terms of the         nonlinear dynamics of excitable media, using those electrophysiological         membrane models; and (4) to examine possible mechanisms of                      defibrillation from the theoretical perspective thus consolidated.                                                                                              By computational modelling of specific ionic mechanisms of the                  particular excitable medium of interest, it should be possible to               understand these mechanisms in quantitative detail for the first time.          This will allow an understanding and control of membrane properties via         altered electric fields.",
