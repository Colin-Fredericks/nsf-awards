 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will contribute to a detailed understanding of the                molecular microstructures and polymerization mechanisms of two                  synthetic polymers having great technological significance.                     These polymers are poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and poly(vinyl                    acetate) (PVAC).  The information to be obtained should                         facilitate the construction of correlations between the                         structures of these substances and their useful properties.                     Also, it should suggest synthetic procedures for tailoring the                  structures so as to achieve desired results.  The work will                     involve the reductive conversion of the polymers into                           hydrocarbons whose molecular structures will be established by                  state-of-the-art 113C NMR.  Knowledge of the reduction chemistries              will then allow the structures of the starting polymers to be                   determined from those of the reduced materials.  This approach,                 coupled with parallel studies involving deuterated reducing                     agents and/or deuterated polymers, will establish the formation                 mechanisms of various structural defects (branches, chain ends,                 etc.) in the polymers of interest.  The research with PVC should                provide conclusive answers to most of the remaining questions                   about the effects of structure on the thermal and oxidative                     stability of this polymer.  Moreover, in the case of PVAC, the                  work should yield much information about the structure of another               useful polymer, poly(vinyl alcohol), which is made from PVAC.",
