 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfields of surface vibrational                           spectroscopy and electrochemistry.  Unenhanced surface Raman                    spectroscopy (SURS) will be developed as an analytical tool for                 studies of adsorption and reaction in electrochemical systems                   and to study short-range or chemical enhancement in surface-                    enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).  Charge-coupled device                      detectors will be employed to increase optical detection                        sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude, thereby making                  a wide range of surface chemical systems accessible for study.                  Orientational phase transitions and electrochemical reaction                    pathways will be studied on smooth electrode surfaces using                     SURS as an in situ probe of the molecular nature of the                         adsorbed species.  Comparisons will be made to systems                          previously studied using SERS.  Electron spectroscopic studies                  using high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy                         combined with Raman excitation profiles and cross-section                       measurements will be used to study chemical effects in SERS                     studies of well-characterized model systems.                                                                                                                    Unenhanced surface Raman spectroscopy is a powerful probe of                    the structures and reactions of molecules adsorbed on solid                     surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum, in high pressure gas ambient                      phases and in the electrochemical environment.  It offers high                  molecular specificity, high spectral and spatial resolution and                 relatively high sensitivity.  In contrast to surface-enhanced                   Raman spectroscopy, this technique does not depend on the                       electronic properties and surface structure of the substrate,                   which may be a metal, semiconductor or dielectric.",
