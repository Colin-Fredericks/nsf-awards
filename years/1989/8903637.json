 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal award in the Organic Dynamics Program is in                        support of the research of Dr. Tad Koch at the University of                    Colorado at Boulder. The research will focus on captodative                     radicals which are stabilized through the combined effect of                    electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups.  This effect                 should be maximum with amino and carboxy substituents.  The                     research will explore further the 2-oxomorpholinyl free radical                 whose substituents are in a rigid ring which maximizes the                      electronic interaction.  These free radicals exist in                           equilibrium with their dimers in solution and function as mild                  one-electron reducing agents in a wide variety of solvents                      including water.  Depending upon the placement of alkyl groups,                 the radicals reduce stoichiometrically molecular oxygen to                      hydrogen peroxide or form isolable peroxides.                                                                                                                   The long range goal of the research is the design, preparation                  and use of captodative radicals.  The specific objectives are                   the design, synthesis and characterization of new                               2-oxomorpholinyl radicals and diradicals which will either bind                 oxygen reversibly, form useful peroxides or serve as                            crosslinking agents for macromolecular structures.  The thermal                 and photochemical reactivity of the resulting peroxides will be                 established.  The redox activity and captodative stabilization                  of 2-oxomorpholinyl radicals as a function of structure and                     medium will be determined.  New structures with enhanced redox                  activity will be designed and synthesized.",
