 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry and physics of metal clusters are studied,                        especially as they relate to heterogeneous catalysis,                           synthesis of ceramic powders, and genesis of metal-                             semiconductor interfaces.  Three areas are addressed.  The                      catalytic activity of organotungsten complexes toward                           hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is studied as a function of                    support and promoter.  Chemisorption of hydrogen and of carbon                  monoxide on very small (5-50 atoms) clusters of Group VIII                      metals is investigated as a function of cluster size and                        shape.  The reactions of reactive organometallic complexes on                   clean surfaces of indium phosphide will be investigated as a                    route to low-defect interfaces for microelectronic                              applications.  A variety of techniques are used including                       temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) and extended X-ray                        absorption fine structure (EXAFS).                                                                                                                              This research is relevant to the production of high-technology                  ceramics, the development of new catalytic processes, and the                   production of high-quality microelectronic devices.  It is                      also pertinent to the more general problem of the production                    and application of very small organized clusters, sometimes                     called nanostructures.",
