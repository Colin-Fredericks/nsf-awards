 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, to be undertaken at Fermilab, will study the                     photoproduction of high pt jets in the Wide Band photon beam, with              photon energies up to 500 GeV.  Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts           that high energy photons couple directly to the constituents of                 nucleons.  However, this process has not yet been seen directly.                Since there are only two underlying QCD subprocesses, theoretical               predictions for jet photoproduction are well-understood.  In addition,          Dr. Corcoran will study the spin dependence of hadronic interactions            in Fermilab's 200 Gev/c polarized proton beam.  Despite theoretical             predictions to the contrary, spin effects have persisted to high                energies, and interesting results are expected in the first data from           this unique beam line.                                                                                                                                          Interactive activities include teaching an undergraduate physics                course and conducting a high energy physics seminar series                      highlighting women physicists.                                                                                                                                  This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
