 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program is continuing                       support of Professor Wittig in pioneering investigations of                     photoinitiated reactions within weakly-bonded gas-phase                         complexes.  A hydrogen atom, departing a photodissociated                       molecule, reacts with the neighboring weakly-bonded molecule                    under initial conditions much more precisely defined than is                    the case in typical investigations of kinetic processes.                        Significant insight is potentially available concerning the                     detailed dynamics of the reaction process.                                                                                                                      For the light hydrogen atom momentarily trapped between the                     other photodissociation fragment and an initially van der                       Waals-bonded partner, Wittig is searching for possible                          dynamical resonances as a function of the initial                               photodissociation conditions.  Other work uses the velocity                     aligned Doppler spectroscopy technique to characterize                          completely the product excitations, including correlations                      between product internal states, for hydrogen atom reactions                    with nitrous oxide.  Extensions will also be made to allow the                  investigation of complexes involving radicals weakly bonded to                  molecules.  Structures of the various complexes are being                       determined with supplementary high-resolution tunable diode                     laser spectroscopy measurements.",
