 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Charles Knobler is supported by a grant from The                      Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study                        problems associated with the dynamics of phase transitions and                  pattern formation in condensed systems.                                                                                                                         Experiments and computer simulations will be used to study                      Breath Figures, the patterns formed when droplets condense on                   partially wetted surfaces.  The research will focus on the                      mechanism of growth of single droplets and the effects on the                   patterns of fluid-surface interactions.  Investigations of                      monolayers of fatty acids at the air-water interface will also                  be conducted.  The evolution of two-dimensional foams at the                    Gas-Liquid Expanded phase transition will be studied and                        investigations will be carried out on the growth of striated                    patterns that are observed in deep quenches into Liquid                         Expanded-Liquid Condensed and Liquid Expanded-Gas two-phase                     regions.  Pattern formation at interfaces in photochemical                      reactions will also be investigated.  Finally, continued light                  scattering measurements on systems with three coexisting phases                 along a path leading to a tricritical point will provide                        information about the asymptotic form of the free energy.",
