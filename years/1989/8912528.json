 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in biological                    oceanography between Dr. Robert Feller, University of South                     Carolina and two British scientists:  Dr. Richard Warwick, Plymouth             Marine Laboratory and Dr. Peter Boyle, University of Aberdeen.                  This joint effort addresses the solution of common problems                     encountered in the visual (microscope-aided) analysis of marine                 food webs involving bottom-dwelling predators which grind, chew,                or rapidly digest their prey.  Immunochemical methods have been                 developed to help solve this problem of how to identify \"invisible\",            but energetically important, prey in the stomach contents of                    scavenging predators.  Polyclonal antibodies are used as probes to              identify solubilized proteins from such prey as nematodes, copepods             and soft-bodied worms.  Immunoassays of shrimp and juvenile fishes              have shown that these quickly digested prey can often, but                      incorrectly, be relegated to inconsequential status compared with               less rapidly digested prey.                                                                                                                                     Research collaborators in the U.K. offer expertise in the ecology and           energetics of nearshore food webs involving bottom-dwelling                     organisms (Dr. R.M. Warwick, Plymouth) and in the quantitative                  immunological analysis of marine food chains (Dr. P. R. Boyle,                  Aberdeen).  Dr. Feller has expertise in ecological applications of              immunology and trophic dynamics of bottom-dwelling crustaceans.                 The investigators will examine the stomach contents of juvenile                 shore crabs and sand shrimp important to fisheries of the U.K. to               see if previously published diet descriptions are biased towards                digestion-resistent prey.  They have also designed an additional                comparative study of the effectiveness of several antibody probes               developed independently to identify proteins from similar prey                  organisms.  Both studies will prove the utility of immunological                methods for solving these otherwise intractable trophic analysis                problems.",
