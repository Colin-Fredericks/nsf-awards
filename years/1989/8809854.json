 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana,                 in cooperation with the University of Chicago, Northwestern                     University and Argonne National Laboratory, is to establish a                   Science and Technology Center for Superconductivity.  The                       director of the Center is Professor Miles V. Klein of the                       University of Illinois.                                                           The intellectual efforts of the Center are directed into six                  interconnected research areas.  Studies in the theory of                        superconductivity involve collaboration between those exert in                  electronic structure calculations, many-body theory, and many-                  body simulations respectively.  Thin films prepared by a variety                of chemical and physical methods are compared and used for both                 studies in fundamental physics and device fabrication.  Studies                 of microstructure address the substructure of superconducting                   materials, contacts and interfaces and their response to various                treatments.  The processing group has the goals of producing high               temperature superconductors that support high current densities                 and are environmentally and thermally stable.  The synthesis                    effort undertakes the sample preparation requirements for all                   Center participants as well as searching for new superconductors                and developing novel methods for controlling purity,                            stoichiometry, and microstructure.  Education and outreach                      programs involve cooperative research with other institutions,                  workshops, conferences, and extensive educational outreach                      through the program now in place at Argonne National Laboratory.                Contacts with industry include direct collaboration and a                       technology transfer program.",
