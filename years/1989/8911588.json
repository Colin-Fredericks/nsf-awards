 "awd_abstract_narration": "What defines the collective identity of a 'generation'? Commonly                perceived but rarely studied systematically is the way in which                 formative events of the recent historic past (like the Thirty's                 depression, the Vietnam war or the computerization of the                       workplace) are differently experienced by various generations                   then alive. This project will replicate and extend past work                    concerned with generational effects on the collective memories of               individuals.The general question driving this work is whether                   different generational groups have distinctive memories that are                shaped by public eventsand if so, when in the course of their                   lives do events make their strongest impression or any memorable                impression at all? Recently published work by the Principal                     Investigator has established, atone point in time, the                          disproportionate influence of political events occurring during                 the adolescence and early adult years, rather than in earlier or                later years. The work proposed here would replicate the result                  and probe further into the range of events (political, but also                 scientific and technological developments) for which it is                      true,the explanations of this effect and the consequences for                   currentattitudes and actions. \f//",
