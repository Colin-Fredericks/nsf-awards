 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research project between         Professor Dewey D. Y. Ryu and colleagues at the University of                   California, Davis, and Professor Shintaro Furusaki, University of               Tokyo, and co-workers at other Japanese universities.  The project              involves multi-disciplinary basic research in plant biotechnology.              Major focus will be on the development of a knowledge base having               broad application to bioprocess technology for the production of                important secondary metabolites from genetically improved plant cell            lines.  Secondary metabolites are cellular metabolic products not               essential to the cell's growth and survival, in contrast to primary             metabolites, which are.  Some secondary metabolites have been found             to be very useful as medicinals, coloring and flavoring agents,                 components for cosmetics, and other economically important products.                                                                                            The Japanese are at the forefront in research and development in this           area.  The collaborating U.S. and Japanese faculty members in this              current project have collective expertise in plant biotechnology, plant         biochemistry, plant genetics, plant cell biology, and biochemical               engineering.  The research program will focus on (1) biochemical design         and genetic construction of plant cells for efficient production of             secondary metabolites of medical and economic importance under                  bioreactor mass cell cultivation conditions; (2) design and development         of a novel bioreactor system suitable for large-scale plant cell                cultivation; and (3) fundamental bioprocess engineering studies on              the plant cell bioreactor system and bioprocess optimization for the            most efficient production of secondary metabolites.  This project is            expected to establish a collaborative research program and a close              working relationship between U.S. and Japanese scientists in the area           of plant biotechnology.  It aims for a significant contribution                 toward advancement of our understanding of generic principles of                plant biotechnology which can be translated to biotechnology                    engineering practices for useful application, especially for the                production of secondary metabolites of economic and medical importance.",
