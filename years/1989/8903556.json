 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is in the general area of analytical and surface                  chemistry and in the subfield of laser spectroscopy. This                       research involves the use of lasers to achieve four wave mixing                 for performing site selective spectroscopy in complex mixtures.                 It is further proposed to eliminate inhomogeneous broadening in                 materials with disorder, to provide selectivity through the                     vibrational modes of an analyte and to work with samples that                   are nonfluorescent. The overall focus of this research is on                    the use of vibrational resonances as a site selective laser                     technique. These methods will primarily use infrared excitation                 followed by high order nonlinear mixing. In addition, the PI                    proposes to develop infrared-optical double resonance with                      fluorescence detection as a technique with the selectivity of                   vibrational spectroscopy and the sensitivity of fluorescence                    spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                                   This research will use multiple lasers to achieve selective                     analysis of complex mixtures through the use of the vibrational                 modes of an analyte. In additional to added selectivity, these                  techniques may also approach the sensitivity of fluorescence                    measurements.",
