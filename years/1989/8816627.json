 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to carry out conduction thermal modeling of                 contact metamorphic aureoles with computer algorithms involving                 numerical (finite difference) simulations of the thermal evolu-                 tion of intrusives.   Variables that we will be considered in                   this modeling include:  shapes of intrusions (both two-                         dimensional and three-dimensional modeling), initial temperature                of the intrusion and country rocks, latent heat of crystalliza-                 tion of the magma, magma convection, thermal diffusivities of the               rocks, and endothermic metamorphic reactions occurring within the               aureoles.  Contact aureoles containing metapelitic lithologies                  serve as excellent locales to investigate these thermal processes               because mineral thermometers in these rocks provide good                        constraints on the temperature field.  A primary thrust of our                  proposed research is to apply our conduction modeling to the                    thermal development of contact aureoles, and to integrate and                   compare our results with independent thermometry of the intru-                  sives and aureole rocks.  Our preliminary two-dimensional                       conduction modeling of the Ottawa and Cupsuptic aureoles in Maine               shows that our proposed research will yield considerable insight                into the nature of intrusives and the surrounding thermal                       aureoles.  For example, our modeling of these aureoles provides                 constraints on the percentage of crystals initially present in                  the intrusives.  The Skiddaw aureole in the Lake District of                    England provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate contact                   metamorphism overlying the roof of an intrusive.  Our modeling of               this aureole may provide us with additional important insight                   into the role of convective fluid circulation in he thermal                     evolution of contact aureoles above intrusives.  The proposed                   modeling of the Strontian aureole in southern Scotland will                     provide not only an analysis of the thermal evolution of contact                metamorphism around a \"mushroom-shaped\" intrusion floored by                    metamorphic rocks, but also improved insight into Lasaga's (1986)               provocative kinetic interpretation of the second sillimanite                    isograd in the Strontian aureole.",
