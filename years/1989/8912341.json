Such large-scale                                        floating platforms can easily be twice or                                       three times the length of the largest ship                                      ever built and many times wider.  Many                                          different geometries for these platforms have                                   been discussed.  On one end of the spectrum,                                    barge-like forms which are wall-sided,                                          shallow rectangular shapes have been proposed                                   (this is the form of most floating bridges).                                    On the other end of the spectrum, forms which                                   are composed of many low-motion column                                          stabilized oil platforms joined together have                                   also been proposed.  Each configuration has                                     its own set of advantages and difficulties                                      both in assembly and operation.  It is a                                        primary goal of this research to develop the                                    technology to investigate and quantify these                                    differences, so that the designer will have                                     the information to choose an appropriate                                        configuration for a particular environment.",
