 "awd_abstract_narration": "The macroscopic forms of interfaces in condensed matter systems                 are often determined by microscopic effects (such as crystalline                anisotropy, the binding energy of atoms to the surface, or random               pinning of the interface by inhomogeneities).  Therefore,                       studies of interfacial shapes can lead to fundamental insights.                 This project is especially concerned with interfaces in non-                    equilibirum systems.  It is intended to establish (a) the degree                to which proven concepts developed for equilibrium systems are                  useful in understanding those driven away from equilibrium and                  (b) the degree to which a macroscopic continuum explanation of                  interfacial patterns is possible.                                                                                                                               Three major areas of investigation are planned:  (1) the kinetic                roughening of faceted crystals, in which crystal shapes become                  rounded during growth; (2) the growth of dendritic crystals                     (snowflake-like structures) and other complex interfaces,                       especially the role of crystalline anistropy and the development                of complex patterns; and (3) the form and dynamics of a fluid                   interface moving in a random porous medium.                                                                                                                     The experiments will utilize high precision digital image                       processing methods developed at Haverford during the previous                   grant period.  This RUI project will employ collaborations                      between graduate and undergraduate students, both to enhance the                effectiveness of undergraduate research and to help address the                 severe shortage of capable researchers interested in                            undergraduate education.",
