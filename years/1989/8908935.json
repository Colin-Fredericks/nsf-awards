 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is to understand the role of social                    cognitive skills and biases in the development of social                        maladjustment in children.  These skills and biases include the                 accurate recognition of others' intentions, the tendency to                     attribute hostile intent to others, the ability to generate many                competent solutions to interpersonal problems, and the ability to               anticipate the consequences of one's own behavior.  It is                       hypothesized that:  1) these skills and biases are stable across                time within a child, thus representing personality.like                         characteristics; 2) children who display skill deficits and                     biases are likely to be socially maladjusted; and 3) children who               display skill deficits and biases are at risk for later social                  and school maladjustment, particularly during the transition to                 middle school.                                                                                                                                                  A sample of 259 boys and girls in grades 1, 2, and 3 have been                  followed for two years and will continue to be followed for an                  additional three years.  Assessments of social cognitive skills                 and biases have been collected each year on each child and will                 be collected yearly.  Measures of social and school maladjustment               will be collected yearly, including ratings of aggressive                       behavior problems, psychiatric symptoms, school disciplinary                    action, and other forms of deviance.                                                                                                                            This research will further our understanding of social cognitive                development during middle childhood.  The findings could form the               empirical base for an intervention aimed at improving children's                social cognitive skills as a way of preventing social and school                maladjustment.",
