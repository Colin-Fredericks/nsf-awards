 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three-trophic-level interactions among cruciferous plants,                 one of their major herbivores, the diamondback moth Pluetella                   xylostella and its major parasitoid Diadegma insulare will be                   studied.  Sex ratios and population sizes of both the moth and                  the parasitoid are correlated with differences in food plants;                  and the trophic levels are likely to have major effects on the                  regulation of population size and the dynamics of interactions                  between these insect species and other components of the                        community.  The variations in the sex ratios of the herbivore and               its parasitoid, using both wild and cultivated crucifers will be                explored.  Selection of species from both wild and cultivated                   habitats will allow the scanning of a large array of plant                      properties, from individual variation in such factors as                        nitrogen, defensive chemistry and morphology, up to population                  variation in patch size and density.  The primary goal of the                   research is to identify factors affecting both moth and wasp sex                ratios within population and community contexts.  The secondary                 goal is to compare these interactions on wild vs. cultivated                    crucifers.  Together, these different systems cover an array of                 community situations from the high density, agricultural                        environments in which population interactions and sex ratio                     variation are usually studied, to the low density, patchy                       communities in which these interactions and insect behaviors                    probably evolved.",
