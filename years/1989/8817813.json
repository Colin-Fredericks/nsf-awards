 "awd_abstract_narration": "The striking diversity of size, color, and form seen in                    flowers is thought to have arisen by natural selection for                      greater pollinator  attractiveness as well as enhanced                          pollination efficiency.  Until quite recently, however, estimates               of pollination success were based solely upon one component of a                flower's reproductive success, i.e. the seeds produced.  Flower                 colors or forms that set more seeds than other variants seen                    within a species have been presumed to enjoy an overall                         evolutionary advantage.  Most flowers, however, reproduce through               both seeds (female function) and pollen (male function).  One-                  half of the genes transmitted to future generations are                         contributed by pollen, but we know almost nothing about the                     impact of flower features on pollen, but we know almost nothing                 about the impact of flower features on pollen donating (male)                   function.  Because of this gap in our knowledge, our                            understanding of flowers and the evolutionary forces that have                  shaped them is in need of major re-examination.                                      The research program for which this grant is a one-year                    renewal is designed to understand how floral features influence                 both male and female reproduction by flowering plants.  The                     principal investigator has shown, for two species of wild radish                (abundant weeds of agricultural land on both coasts of North                    America), that variation for petal color, petal size, and pollen                production can influence reproduction.  Most importantly, male                  reproduction seems to be more strongly influenced by floral                     variation than seed production.  To understand how these weedy                  species proliferate and evolve, the factors influencing male,                   pollen-donating function must be understood.  During the renewal                period, the principal investigator will study the effects of                    pollen grain number and size upon evolutionary fitness.  The                    results have implications for weed control, as well as for crop                 breeding.",
