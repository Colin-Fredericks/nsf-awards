 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is generally accepted that bending of epithelial cell sheets                 during early organ formation is caused by constriction of cell                  apices and/or bases.  The mechanism of constriction is thought to               be interactions of myosin with actin filaments anchored in the                  plasma membrane.  This hypothesis is based primarily on                         circumstantial evidence.  Changes have been shown in the width of               microfilament bundles at cell apices in morphogenetically active                regions of primordia and shape change in many organ primordia is                inhibited by drugs that interfere with the integrity of actin                   filaments.  However, the arrangement of filament bundles differs                in different primordia and in different regions of the same                     primordium. Careful measurements of shape change have been done                 only for neural fold formation and the results do not exclude                   other mechanisms for shape change.  The goal of this study is to                provide not only careful measurements of cell size and shape for                all regions of several representative primordia, but also to                    quantitate changes in cytoskeletal components during the shape                  changes.  This will be accomplished by computer assisted image                  analysis.  Furthermore, the results will be tested with a                       computer model of organogenesis to determine which observed                     changes are sufficient and necessary to produce the organotypic                 shape changes.  Computer modelling will allow additional                        experimental testing of each hypothesis.                                        %%%                                                                             During the development of the embryo organs are formed and shaped               from cells.  Dr. Hilfer will test the hypothesis that organ                     formation is controlled primarily by changes in cell shape.  He                 will use microscopic measurements of developing embryos as well                 as computer models to test this hypothesis.",
