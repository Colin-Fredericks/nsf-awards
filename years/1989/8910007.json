 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop a two-level                    performance model for cellular manufacturing systems where the                  cells are connected via a material handling system (MHS) and raw                material and unfinished parts are stored in an Automatic                        Storage/Retrieval System (AS/RS).  Each cell by itself is a                     network of workstations sharing a common finite storage space and               a load/unload station.  These workstations are connected via a                  material handling unit.                                                              The model is such that in one level the individual cells,                  the MHS and the AS/RS are each analyzed separately.  (The                       interdependency among these components is reflected in the                      analysis.)  The results from this level are then utilized in a                  second level in order to define an aggregated network of stations               each representing a cell, the MHS, or the AS/RS.  This network is               then decomposed into subnetworks based on a concept originally                  introduced by the Principal Investigator.  The interrelationship                between the two levels requires an iterative numerical technique                in order to compute different performance measures.                                  From a modeling perspective, the model makes two significant               contributions: (1) it explicitly considers the MHS and the AS/RS,               (2) it accounts for different scheduling policies and, therefore,               reflects the dynamic nature of the system to some degree.                            From an application perspective, the model may be used in                  different circumstances, ranging from the analysis of an                        individual cell to the analysis of a large scale network type                   manufacturing system.",
