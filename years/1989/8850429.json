 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a joint effort, the School of Education and the Department                   of Biology at Indiana University, Bloomington, will provide a                   six-week workshop on recent developments in biology for 30                      in-service high school biology teachers during the summer of                    1989.  The workshop will be followed by several efforts to                      help the teachers incorporate what they have learned into                       their teaching programs.                                                                                                                                        Four topics will be emphasized in the workshop: 1) human                        genetics, 2) molecular biology and molecular genetics, 3)                       immunology, and 4) biochemical techniques.  Instructors will                    start at the level where most participants seem to be and by                    the end of the session try to introduce considerable recently                   discovered information.  Lecture and discussion time will be                    devoted to each topic, but of equal importance will be the                      laboratory component, which will consist of two elements.                       One will be exercises used to demonstrate principles and                        examples that are usual in a college-level lab setting.  The                    second will be labs that should be suitable for demonstrating                   some essential elements of the material in a high school lab                    situation.  This will provide the in-service teachers with                      ideas and expertise that they can incorporate rather directly                   into their own teaching programs.  The in-service teachers                      will be asked to help with the development of the latter                        exercises, thus helping generate a self-confidence that they                    can adapt these exercises for their own situations.                                                                                                             Several efforts will be made to ensure that the workshop has                    an impact on teaching.  The teachers will all come from                         Indianapolis and the southern half of Indiana, making it                        possible for them to communicate relatively easily with each                    other and with the workshop faculty after the workshop.                         During the school year 89-90, teams of workshop faculty will                    visit the schools of the participants, serve as resources                       regarding the content and nature of modules being tried in                      the high schools, and encourage administrators to be                            supportive of these teachers.                                                                                                                                   This program is the first to offer the High School Biology                      teachers of Indiana the opportunity of expanding their                          knowledge base in several important topics.  This broad                         approach will better able the teachers to improve many areas                    of their curriculum.                                                                                                                                            Indiana University has contributed an amount equal to 13% of                    the National Science Foundation award.",
