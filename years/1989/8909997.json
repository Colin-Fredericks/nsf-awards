 "awd_abstract_narration": "A systems based approach will be used for improving low pressure                plasma deposition (LPPD) processes.  LPPD enables production of                 engineering materials of fine microstructure, high density, in                  useful engineering shapes.  Important applications include                      production of metal matrix composites and alloy materials used in               gas turbines and aircraft engines.  Currently, these processes are              operated in an empirically determined feedforward fashion.  This                poses limits on the achievable material quality and on the speed                the process can be adapted to meet new manufacturing and materials              requirements.  This study will determine the important process                  characteristics needed to develop alternative controller design and             will also aid in optimizing the operating regime and system design.             Low order models (LOMs) that capture the dominant system dynamics               will be developed to reveal the important system relationships.                 The process models will be analyzed to obtain an explicit                       description of the process constraints for LPPD.The LOMs will be                developed from lumped and parametric representations of the process             physics and by reduction of existing high order models.  Analysis               results will be confirmed by comparison to existing high order                  modelling and experimental studies.",
