 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand, both in a general                    theoretical way, and in concrete and empirically relevant                       economic problems, asset market equilibrium.  Algorithms for                    computing equilibria in models with a mixture of private and                    social risk were programmed under the previous grant.  They are                 used in this product to study a new class of models with limited                insurance possibilities: debt constrained asset markets.                        Liquidity constraints emerge in this model from the assumption                  that it is not possible to force borrowers to service or pay off                debts from their future income.  Traders may be denied credit,                  and their assets may be attached for the payment of past debts.                 This is a reasonable representation of the way in which actual                  asset markets work.  Debtor prison no longer exists, and indeed,                modern bankruptcy laws make it possible for traders to preserve                 some assets even in the face of bankruptcy laws.  Debt                          constrained markets could explain why insurance markets are                     incomplete in real world economies.                                                                                                                             Research is continued on the dynamics of asset distribution                     models.  This project relaxes the assumption of a representative                economic agent made in real business cycle models.  Numerical                   simulation on the supercomputer is used to determine the global                 picture of the set of equilibria of asset distributions with a                  mix of private and social risk.  The project develops and tests                 methods of accurately approximating these asset distribution.                                                                                                   Methods developed in the previous project to study reputation and               learning in repeated games are extended and used to study                       learning and approximate knowledge in asset markets.  This is                   important because it permits rigorous analysis of asset market                  behavior that can't otherwise be explained.  Most current                       theories either assume common knowledge or assume behavior that                 is so stupid that it is hard to imagine even a naive agent                      behaving this way.                                                                                                                                              In sum, this research develops powerful new methodological tools                for studying market dynamics with heterogeneous agents and for                  rigorously modelling markets in which agents make mistakes but                  learn from their mistakes.  These tools are used to study                       realistic models of asset markets in which certain risks can not                be insured or can be insured at prohibitive rates.",
