It will be hosted by the                        American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES), which is                  the U.S. representative to UPADI.  UPADI is an international                    educational and scientific organization composed of the                         national engineering societies of 26 countries in the                           Americas.  It is dedicated to promoting unity among engineers                   and furthering the progress of science and technology for all                   people.  UPADI educational congresses and roundtables have                      been held twenty times since 1949, generally every other year.                  The 199O UPADI Convention will mark the first time since 1952                   that this prestigious meeting will be held in the United                        States.  The 1988 meeting was held in Cuba.  It is the desire                   of the United States engineering community, as well as NSF, to                  encourage the convening of major international scientific                       conferences in the United States.",
