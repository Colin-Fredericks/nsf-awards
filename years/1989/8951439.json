 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students in the fields of environmental planning and resource                   management are increasingly faced with the need to become                       familiar with techniques of image processing and geographic                     information systems.  It is important to strengthen and expand                  undergraduate coursework in these areas by improving student                    training in remote sensing, geographic information systems and                  environmental planning.  An integrated computer-based hardware                  and software system (ERDAS) is used to meet these needs, through                expanding the content of three upper level courses, offering                    broader opportunities for independent student research and                      supplementing the content of two other upper level courses and a                large enrollment lower level course.  Students in Remote Sensing                courses are learning a range of digital image processing                        techniques through the development of test area classifications.                In two related courses, Analytic Methods and Environmental                      Planning, students develop and manipulate digital data bases                    using geographic information system capabilities and evaluate the               cartographic and statistical output.  The ERDAS system requested                also allows students to understand the links between the two                    technologies and expand their abilities to respond to problems in               the professional environment.  The institution is matching the                  NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
