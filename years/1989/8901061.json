 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an interdisciplinary research project for development,                  implementation, and application of algorithms in computer and                   computational algebra.  Research will be done in four areas:                    Computational Algebra and Algebraic Geometry; Real Closed Fields and            Algebraic Cell Decomposition; Integration and Root Finding Techniques;          and Applications in Flows and Dynamical Systems.                                                                                                                In the area of computational algebra and algebraic geometry, such               problems as finding improved methods for computing primary                      decompositions, finding versal deformations, computing with inverse             systems of ideals, and calculating Hilbert functions will be                    investigated as well as developing parallel algorithms for finding              Groebner bases, applying subalgebra membership determination to finding         polynomial functional decomposition and improving subalgebra algorithms         for computing with subfields of rational function fields.  A                    generalization of multivariate resultants to general commutative rings          will be investigated.  The computer algebra system Macaulay will be             extended to handle splines, primary decompositions, ideal radicals,             inhomogeneous Groebner bases, polynomial factorization, rational                arithmetic and floats.  Macaulay will be improved with regard to root           finding, Hilbert function calculation, data structures representing             monomial ideals, and reducing virtual memory thrashing.                                                                                                         In the area of real and algebraically closed fields and algebraic cell          decomposition, the Ben-Or, Kozen, Reif decision procedure will be               improved and implemented and polynomial root finding techniques will be         used to give an improved algorithm for computing full adjacency                 relations in algebraic cell decomposition.                                                                                                                      In the area of integration and root finding techniques, the problem of          lifting positive characteristic integration back to characteristic zero         will be investigated and the Ben-Or, Feig, Kozen, Tiwari algorithm for          approximating all real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients             will be implemented.  Finally, in the area of flows and dynamical               systems, Groebner basis techniques will be applied to the problem of            calculating a bound on the number of limit cycles of a polynomial flow          and general utilities for the implementation of several related                 perturbation methods will be developed and implemented.",
