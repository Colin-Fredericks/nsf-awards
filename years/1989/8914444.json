 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1989 Boulder Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry will                  be held on the campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder,                   Colorado on June 19-23, 1989.  The general topics to be covered                 include:  Heterogeneous Chemistry, Stratospheric Chemistry, and                 the Atmospheric Chemistry of Organic Compounds, particularly                    their role in oxidant formation.  The topics are related and                    pivotal to an understanding of current national and                             international concerns such as stratospheric ozone depletion                    and tropospheric ozone pollution.                                                    The format for the Boulder conference will be very similar                 to that of the Gordon Conference which encourages the free                      discussion of scientific ideas and issues.  The attendance will                 be limited to about 135 participants, including speakers and                    session chair-persons.  The location of the dormitories, eating                 halls, and the lecture hall are such that direct interactions                   among the participants is greatly facilitated.  The attendees                   are drawn from scientific groups who otherwise do not meet                      often in the course of their research or at scientific society                  meetings.",
