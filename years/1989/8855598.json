Visitors in teams will run a scientific                     mission to the planet Mars.  Exhibits and simulation activities                 will cover basic and applied science and mathematics topics                     appropriate for middle to high school students and family                       audiences.  Educational materials for school use will accompany                 the exhibition.                                                                                                                                                 COSI has a strong reputation for interactive science exhibitions.               Their widely acclaimed \"Science of Sports\" exhibition will be                   seen in more than 15 cities.  The Pacific Science Center has a                  similar reputation for educational exhibitions and related                      materials development.  Their educational materials on dinosaurs                have been widely used by other museums.  The Battelle Memorial                  Institute is a world- renowned research and applied science                     organization.  \"Mission to Mars\" is supported by commitments from               thirteen of America's leading science museums and a major award                 from Apple Computer Company.  The project team will deliver a                   timely exhibition that will be both engaging and challenging,                   rich with scientific detail while still appealing to family                     audiences.                                                                                                                                                      \"Mission to Mars\" will travel to 13 cities on a three year tour,                reaching an estimated three to five million people.  NSF's 43% of               the project cost will be leveraged by more than $878,000 in                     contributions from the originating institutions, from the                       displaying museums and from Apple.",
