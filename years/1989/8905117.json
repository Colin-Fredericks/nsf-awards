 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed studies is to understand the                           function of the X chromosome and X-chromosome inactivation                      (XCI) during mammalian spermatogenesis, and the relation of                     these events to meiosis and spermatogenic differentiation.                      Since abnormalities in either structure or number of X                          chromosomes almost inevitably result in male (but not female)                   sterility, the cycle of X-chromosome activity in male germ                      cells is likely to be an integral, controlling element of                       their meiotic activity and differentiation.  The development                    time of X-chromosome expression and XCI during                                  spermatogenesis will be determined to test the hypothesis                       that XCI coincides with the onset of meiosis.  The genetic                      extent of XCI will be examined to test the hypothesis that                      inactivation includes genes in the non-pairing region, but                      not those in the pairing region, of the X chromosome.  The                      genetic control of XCI will be investigated to determine if                     it is controlled from a single site on the chromosome and to                    test the hypothesis that it is not associated with                              hypermethylation of regulatory sequences.  The expression of                    X-linked genes will be investigated in sterile mouse mutants                    to determine if the deleterious effect of supernumerary X                       chromosomes on spermatogonia is due to failure of dosage                        compensation and if the lethal effect of structural                             abnormalities of the X chromosome on spermatocytes is due to                    failure of XCI.                                                                                                                                                 These studies will lead to more complete understanding of the                   biological role of sex chromosomes during male meiosis and                      germ cell differentiation.",
