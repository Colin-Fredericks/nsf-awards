 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developed under the leadership of the University of               Texas-El Paso (UTEP), establishes a Comprehensive Regional Center for           Minorities in the El Paso region of West Texas. Cooperating                     institutions and organizations, in addition to the University,                  include the following: El Paso Community College; the El Paso,                  Socorro, and Ysleta Independent School Districts; New Mexico                    Institute of Mining and Technology; Sul Ross State University;                  Western New Mexico University; and, the Texas Region XIX Education              Service Center.                                                                                                                                                 Figures on the minority enrollment in the cooperating colleges and              universities show a total of 21,000 minority students (over 19,000 of           whom are Hispanic). This represents 66% of the total enrollment in              those institutions. Minority enrollment in the targeted school                  systems is 101,000 (95,500 of whom are Hispanic), representing 81% of           the total enrollment.                                                                                                                                           Center activities include: a focus on critical junctures in the                 science career pipeline and on the factors that affect Hispanic                 students' decisions about education; an emphasis on the needs and               characteristics of the local Mexican American population and of the             institutions in the region; characteristics designed to complement              and support the University's NSF Minority Research Center of                    Excellence; and, an emphasis on the support and involvement of                  industry, business and community leaders.                                                                                                                       Center management is the primary responsibility of the two Co-                  Directors with advice from two committees: a Regional Advisory                  Board; and, the NSF National Advisory Committee. The membership of              the Regional Advisory Board includes one key administrator from each            of the three participating school districts, three teachers, one                representative of each higher education institution, two regional               business leaders, one regional civic leader, and one state-wide                 leader of public education. The NSF National Advisory Committee                 consisting of leaders in science, industry, engineering, science                education, and higher education provides advice to the Center and to            NSF on long-term planning and evaluation.                                                                                                                       Among the enrichment activities for precollege and community college            students are: Summer Science Day Camps at elementary schools; Summer            Math/Science Computer Camps for 8th and 9th Grade students; Summer              Institutes in science and engineering for junior and senior high                students; Campus Visit Days for science students; and, Summer Bridge            Programs for Community College Graduates.                                                                                                                       A series of activities to improve instruction in the schools                    include: A series of Summer Workshops for precollege teachers; a                Science/Math Aides Program; and, Regional Conferences for Science               Educators. The Center also sponsors a series of Science and                     Engineering Career Workshops for counselors and teachers.                                                                                                       Improvements in the effectiveness of entry level college mathematics            and science courses is the major focus of the undergraduate                     activities of the Center, with Chemistry being  the discipline                  targeted in the first year.                                                                                                                                     A detailed evaluation and reporting plan will be completed during the           first year including a formative evaluation of first year Center                activities and a report to NSF outlining the results of that                    evaluation and proposing program revisions for the second through               fifth years. Ample computer capacity is available to support the                evaluation of Center activities.                                                                                                                                This project is an excellent example of a Comprehensive Regional                Center for Minorities. It is targeted at a minority population of               substantial size, and it is comprehensive in terms of attention to              the various educational levels and age groups, in disciplinary                  coverage, in coordination and cooperation among school systems,                 colleges and universities and community organizations, and in its               focus on nurturing, encouraging and motivating minority students.               Significant additional financial support is being contributed to the            project by the participating organizations and groups.                          \f                     //",
