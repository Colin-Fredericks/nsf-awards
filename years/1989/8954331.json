 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two two-week summer workshops are being held to acquaint undergraduate          professors with new curricula ideas in the areas of geometry and                statistics and their applications.  Leaders in each field, both                 academics and practitioners, are interacting with fifty nationally drawn        participants to enable them to understand new developments in these             mathematical fields and to prepare applications-based modular materials         suitable for use in their classrooms.  Areas being discussed in geometry        include tilings, combinatorial geometry and computational geometry.             Statistics areas include data acquisition (especially statistically             designed experiments), data analysis by graphical methods, and inference        procedures for many-variable data, including new procedures that require        less restrictive assumptions than traditional methods.                                                                                                          A formal follow-up session will be held at the national joint AMS/MAA           meetings in January, where participants may discuss the aspect of the           training on their campuses and the use of modular materials with their          students.",
