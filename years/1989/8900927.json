 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of bioinorganic chemistry. The                 project deals with the synthesis and reaction chemistry of                      derivatives of vitamin B-12. Various derivatives of this                        vitamin serve as coenzymes in the catalysis of about 15 enzymic                 reactions in organisms ranging from bacteria to human beings.                                                                                                   Details of two kinds of recently discovered isomerism in                        organocobalt derivatives of vitamin B-12 will be studied. The                   first involves formation of upper (beta) and lower (alpha)                      alkylcobalt derivatives when cobinamides (vitamin B-12                          derivatives lacking the pendant axial ligand) are reductively                   alkylated with some, but not other alkylating agents. The                       reason for the different outcomes with different alkylating                     agents will be studied as well as the mechanism of formation of                 two isomers and the conditions under which the isomers can be                   interconverted. Preliminary results indicate that                               interconversion of such isomers may involve novel                               dialkylcobinamide species. The second type of isomerism                         involves formation of pairs of apparently isomeric alkylcobalt                  derivatives when aquocobalamin is reductively alkylated with                    alkoxyethyl bromides. These cannot be alpha and beta isomers,                   but are believed to be 2-alkoxyethyl and 1-alkoxyethyl                          cobalamins. The structures will be determined by NMR                            spectroscopy of products synthesized with isotopically enriched                 alkoxyethyl bromides, and the mechanism of formation of such                    pairs of isomers will be studied. The conditions under which                    the isomers are interconverted will be determined also.",
