 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of thin films to perform separations is an emerging                technology which can be a key in the economic competitiveness of                the chemical process and biotechnology industries.  The separation              step is often the major factor in determining the cost of a                     product.                                                                             Industry has indicated an interest in supporting a                         cooperative research center in separations using thin films.  The               co-principal investigators are highly qualified to direct a study               of the viability and feasibility of an Industry/University                      Cooperative Research Center for Separations Using Thin Films.  The              study would determine if the Center has the potential to become                 self-sufficient with industrial funding in a five-year period as                NSF funding is phased out.  The objective of such a Center would                be to address the generic research needs of industry, especially                in polymeric membranes, thin film processes, fiber coatings,                    advanced ceramic materials, biosensors, surface science and                     catalysis, liquid crystals, and chemical complexation.  An I/UCR                Center at the University of Colorado appears to be a promising                  approach to satisfy the noted need.  Alternative organizations,                 operations, and policies would be studied as well as industry's                 interests and specific needs in research.                                            The Program Manager recommends that the University of                      Colorado be awarded $25,000 for one year to fund such a study.                  All future funding will be on the basis of a new proposal.                           This recommendation has been coordinated with Dr. Jeffrey H.               Harwell, Program Director of the Separation and Purification                    Processes Program.",
