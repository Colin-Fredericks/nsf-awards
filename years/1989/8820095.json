 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ear is a complex of sensory organs for equilibrium                          (vestibular sense) and hearing, sending signals to the brain by                 branches of the eighth (octaval) cranial nerve.  In fishes and                  aquatic vertebrates, a system called the lateral line detects                   water-borne mechanical signals, and in many species also has                    electrosensory organs.  The ear and lateral line system were                    traditionally considered closely related, forming a single                      octavolateralis system, largely for hearing.  In this                           view, evolutionarily early centers in the brain for analyzing                   lateral line information later became auditory centers in land                  vertebrates which lack lateral lines.                                                                                                                           Recent studies of comparative brain anatomy and physiology have                 demonstrated the four subsystems do not in fact overlap much in                 the lower parts of their central neural pathways, nor in their                  physiological sensitivity.  This study will use anatomical                      techniques to trace those pathways in less and more specialized                 fish, to higher levels including the important forebrain, which                 evolves into the cerebral cortex of mammals.  Central                           organization of the auditory pathways in fishes will be compared                to the lateral line pathways.  Defining these pathways is                       necessary as a baseline to understand how auditory pathways have                been modified during the striking evolution of the ear for                      hearing in land vertebrates.  In addition, these studies will                   clarify the evolution of the remarkably diverse mechanisms for                  hearing found among the many species of bony fishes, which                      represent a complicated history of loss, invention, and                         re-invention of various receptor classes.  Results will be                      important to sensory science, ichthyology, and evolutionary                     biology.",
