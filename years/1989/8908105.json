 "awd_abstract_narration": "In modern transmission and recording channels, it is often                 required to map the data onto a sequence with special                           properties.  These properties are dictated by various practical                 aspects such as self-clocking, limitations on the intersymbol                   interference, and bandwidth constraints.  Since most channels                   are noisy, the transmitted data should have error correction                    capability as well.  The classical coding schemes for noisy                     modulation channels are based on using two independently designed               codes:  one for error correction and the other for modulation.                  Although these two codes may be optimal with regard to their                    respective goals, the combined code may be far from optimal when                used over the channel.    The research studies the relation                     between modulation and error correction properties which will                   enable viewing these two  properties inseparably from each other.               Efficient codes designed specifically for noisy modulation                      channels then will be  developed.",
