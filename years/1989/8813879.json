 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for renewal of research by Professor John C. H.                   Spence, Arizona State University, on electron microscopy for                    study of surfaces of ceramics and electronic materials.  During                 the previous grant (DMR-8512784) more than twelve substantive                   publications in refereed scientific journals were produced.                     Highlights of the significant accomplishments include design,                   construction and testing of a scanning tunnelling microscope                    which operates inside a transmission electron microscope                        (allowing simultaneous operation of the two techniques on the                   same specimen); the technique known as convergent beam electron                 microdiffraction was made quantitative to allow determination of                the electron ground state charge density of gallium arsenide                    (this allows determination of the nature of the chemical bonds in               this technologically important material); advances in theory of                 electron channeling effect on Auger electron production in the                  reflection high energy electron diffraction technique  provided                 analytical means to determine the atomic site of adatoms on clean               surfaces; a novel method for forming atomic lattice images in                   semiconductors has been developed which allows lattice imaging of               dislocation defects normal to the electron beam with a                          resolution of 0.3 nanometer (ten times more sensitive than                      previously possible).  The current research will continue to seek               novel techniques for the use of electron beams to study the                     structure of ceramics and electronic materials on a atomic scale                with emphasis on the understanding the scanning tunneling                       microscope, the atom location by channeling-enhanced                            microanalysis for study of adatoms on semiconductor surfaces;                   electron energy spectra from surface states; and quantitative                   electron crystallography for the study of chemical bonding in                   crystals.                                                                                                                                                       Professor Spence has been referred to by his peers as the most                  innovative scientist using electron microscopy in the U.S. He has               consistently trained students of high quality for research in the               important field of electron microscopy for materials science.",
