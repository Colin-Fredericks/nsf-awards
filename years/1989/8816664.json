The technique provides a                        powerful, objective method of defining eustatic vs. subsidence                  effects at 1 to 10 m.y. scale, and allows recognition of sequence               boundaries in cyclic carbonates.  We will run 1-dimensional                     computer simulations of the stratigraphic sequences logged in the               field, and 2-dimensional simulations to generate stratigraphic                  cross-sections that may be compared with actual cross-sections                  showing meter scale, vertical as well as lateral changes in rock                types.  Our models are capable of utilizing complex sea level                   curves to generate isostatically balanced, simulated                            stratigraphic sections and cross-sections showing rock changes at               the meter-scale, necessary for a study of carbonate cycles.  We                 will perform spectral analysis on deeper water facies in the                    sequences to determine if there is any record of Milankovitch                   climatic changes in the deeper water facies.  The computer                      simulations will be constrained with geological data.  This                     approach should provide us with a much firmer understanding of                  how carbonate cycles are arranged on carbonate platforms, how                   they are packaged in Vail-sequences, and how the various types of               allocyclic and autocyclic mechanisms control their development in               the Paleozoic.  Research will document the effects of climatic                  and sea level change on the accumulation of sedimentary rocks.",
