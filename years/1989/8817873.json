 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program will support research in the general area of                  organometallic chemistry, with particular emphasis on reactions                 of carbon dioxide promoted by organometallic compounds. The                     practical interest in such reactions derives from the strong                    possibility that carbon dioxide will be used as a source of                     carbon for chemical synthesis in the future, in for example                     reactions with hydrogen derived from the decomposition of water                 by solar energy.                                                                                                                                                The long-term goal of the project is a clear mechanistic view                   of carbon-hydrogen, carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen bond                        forming processes resulting from the insertion of carbon                        dioxide into M-H, M-C and M-O bonds. Reactivity studies have                    revealed a similarity in reaction characteristics for                           carbon-hydrogen and carbon-carbon bond forming reactions                        involving anionic octahedral metal derivatives and neutral                      square-planar metal complexes. It has further been shown that                   knowledge gained from investigating these different processes                   occurring on individual metal centers is transferable to metal                  centers where both reaction types are possible. The insight                     gained from transition metal-carbon dioxide chemistry will be                   used in exploring potential uses of carbon dioxide as a                         feedstock for the synthesis of organic chemicals. Specific                      areas to be explored include decarboxylation mechanisms of                      metallo-formates and -carbonates, alkyl-, aryl- and silyl-oxide                 chemistry of low-valent metals, studies related to C-H                          activation and functionalization, and catalytic processes                       involving carbon dioxide.",
