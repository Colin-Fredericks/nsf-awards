 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last four years the Department of Ecology and                        Evolutionary Biology has successfully sought to attract new                     faculty members who are active researchers in several developing                areas of molecular evolution.  In addition, a number of new and                 established researchers are increasingly beginning to molecular                 techniques t answer evolutionary questions.  Collaborations with                researchers in other departments such as Molecular and Cellular                 Biology and Biochemistry are also increasing.  These trends are                 expected accelerate in the future resulting in even greater                     interest in utilizing the most modern techniques which are                      applicable to evolutionary research in a broad range of areas.                                                                                                  The renovation and equipping of laboratories to meet these new                  research needs has involved major capital expenditure which has                 largely been met through departmental set.up funds for new                      faculty members and equipment purchased on the grants of                        individual investigators.  However, one major item of equipment,                a preparative ultracentrifuge, is still not available in the                    department.  This equipment is currently being borrowed from                    members of the Departments of Molecular and Cell Biology and                    Biochemistry and Veterinary Science (located in another                         building).  This is an increasing unsatisfactory arrangement for                all concerned.  There are serious problems of availability and                  scheduling and the goodwill of colleagues in other departments                  is being taxed.  An ultracentrifuge for the shared use of members               of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology is                        therefore an urgent necessity.",
