 "awd_abstract_narration": "Union college is one of a select group of small colleges                   which has been particularly successful in preparing                             undergraduates for graduate work in chemistry because of our                    strong curriculum and flourishing program for undergraduate                     research in chemistry.  Polymer Chemistry, one of the more                      popular courses for undergraduates which also draws students from               local industries, is a combination of organic and physical                      applications.  This project replaces the out-moded instruments                  with new instrumenttion which is also used in organic and                       physical chemistry laboratories, and in senior thesis research.                 The upgraded equipment and its uses follow.  Gel permeation                     average and a weight-average molecular weight for a given polymer               sample.  Osmotic pressure measurements give number-average                      molecular weights; vapor phase osometers are used for molecular                 weights below 25,000 and membrane osometers are used for samples                with higher molecular weights.  Thermal analysis (TGA) give                     important physical properties of polymers which are necessary to                match a polymer to a particular industrial application.                                                                                                              The institution is matching the award with an equal amount                 of funds.",
