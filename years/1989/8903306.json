 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenomena embodied in the interaction of hydrogen with the                  surface of a simple metal encompasses most of the basic concepts                in surface science, and these systems are tractable                             theoretically.  A plethora of theoretical predictions based on a                wide range of calculational procedures have gone unchallenged or                unsubstantiated due to the almost complete absence of                           experimental data.  Experimental techniques have now advanced to                the stage where it is possible to probe both the dynamics and the               statics of the interaction of hydrogen with simple metal                        surfaces.  Activated adsorption and State Selective Detection of                H2 will be used to measure the shape  of the potential energy                   surface which makes the dissociation of H2 an activated process.                Angle Resolved Inelastic Electron Scattering will be utilized to                measure the modification of the surface phonon spectra and the                  surface plasmon dispersion which is induced by various phases of                adsorbed H.  Changes (induced by H) in the surface electronic                   distribution will be probed by Angle Resolved Photoemission and                 Second Harmonic Generation.  The surface geometrical structure                  will be determined using Low Energy Electron Diffraction.                       Finally, the effect of metallic particle size will be studied                   using clusters formed in a beam apparatus.",
