 "awd_abstract_narration": "The economic viability of a chemical manufacturing process is                   dependent on maintaining and regulating the system in some prescribed           manner.  The ability to maintain product specifications while                   minimizing energy or natural resource consumption is accomplished by            the use of process control systems.  The goal of this project is to             develop control system techniques that use a nonlinear dynamic model            of the chemical process as a basis for feedback control.                                                                                                        A nonlinear parameter estimation procedure will be developed to                 estimate important process parameters such as effectiveness factors or          heat transfer coefficients, as well as process disturbances such as             feed stream composition.  In addition to parameter estimation, a                nonlinear optimization-based procedure will be used to maintain a               desired output variable trajectory, similar to techniques that have             been proven successful for linear systems.  The process model,                  characterized by a set of nonlinear differential equations, will be             transformed to algebraic equations using orthogonal collocation on              finite elements.  Sequential quadratic programming will be used to              solve the nonlinear  optimization subject to the algebraic equation             equality constraints and manipulated and state variable inequality              constraints.  This nonlinear control strategy will result in tighter            regulation of important process variables, allowing a more optimal              operation of chemical processes.  This                                          research will also result in a more complete understanding of                   linear predictive control techniques, since many of the important               effects proposed for study have not been previously addressed for               the linear system case.",
