 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the source of the solar wind, the solar corona is a                     crucial component of solar-terrestrial relations.  The study is                 the first attempt to derive both the magnetic field and density                 distribution over 3-dimensions in the solar corona from                         measurements.  It will test the underlying assumptions of the                   most recent model, that the global structure of the corona can be               described  with a simple magnetostatic model that includes only                 horizontal currents in the corona.  Furthermore, application of                 this model to the extensive synoptic data sets will give a                      quantitative description of the variations in the corona over                   timescales comparable to the solar cycle.  This will be an                      important step towards understanding the structure and stability                of the solar corona.                                                                 The aim of study is to derive large-scale, fully 3                         dimensional descriptions of both the magnetic field and the                     distribution of plasma in the lower corona.  The model is to be                 constrained by (a) measurements of white light that has ben                     scattered by coronal electrons (obtained at the High Altitude                   Observatory coronameter stationed at Mauna Loa, Hawaii) and (b)                 measurements of the magnetic field in the photosphere (obtained                 at the Stanford Solar Observatory).  Each coronameter measurement               is an integral of scattered light along a line-of-sight through                 the 3-d density structure.  Thus inverting the coronal                          tomography, with the added constraint that the model must also                  match the observed photospheric magnetic field.  To model the                   large-scale structure, which does not change substantially over a               solar rotation, it is possible to take a magnetostatic model and                data from a full rotation.  Studies will consider data from solar               minimum when the corona is most steady, but the ultimate goal is                to find a quantitative means of describing changes in the solar                 corona over timescales such as the solar cycle.//",
