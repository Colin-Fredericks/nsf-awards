 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemists carrying out frontier research are relying more and                    more on computers that are capable of handling sophisticated                    simulations, data analysis and graphics software.  The need to                  accomodate multiple users on a single laboratory computer and                   multiple uses on a single chemistry department facility can be                  met by a single solution:  individual work stations for the                     majority of user needs and, for the remainder, ready access to                  other types of work stations and, ultimately, to a                              minisupercomputer.                                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts                      Institute of Technology to acquire, maintain and operate a                      multi-access core computing facility.  The areas of chemical                    research that will be enhanced by the acquisition include:                                                                                                      1) The chemistry of transition metal complexes in binucleating                     macrocycles                                                                  2) The use of X-ray diffraction to examine productive                              enzyme-substrate complexes                                                   3) The chemistry of organometallic compounds containing                            multiple metal-carbon bonds                                                  4) Asymmetric synthesis                                                         5) Interactions in large molecular arrays and aggregates                        6) Dynamics of small polyatomic molecules in highly excited                        vibrational states                                                           7) Modelling of modified semiconductor surfaces.",
