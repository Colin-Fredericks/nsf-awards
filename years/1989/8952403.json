 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth Science department is developing a microcomputer-based                laboratory to augment capabilities in undergraduate remote                      sensing/geographic information systems (GIS) education and research.            Networking of three Map and Image Processing Systems workstations and           peripheral hardware and supporting software will provide students               with training and instruction in the acquisition, processing, and               displaying of spatial digital data.  Importation of                             satellite/airborne data from computer compatible tapes using an open            reel tape deck will enable greater access to information stored on 9-           track tapes and will introduce the student to a variety of data                 sources and formats.  A digitizing tablet will permit students to               generate data bases from readily available hardcopy sources for                 subsequent analysis via image processing and GIS modules.  A laser              printer will provide high quality graphics output suitable for                  classroom presentations and research reports.  This equipment will              improve the quality of remote sensing and GIS coursework and research           done by students in earth science, earth science education,                     geography/cartography and geology, enhancing their preparation for              graduate work and professional employment.                                                                                                                      The university will match the award with an equal amount of funds.",
