 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurement of water vapor concentration or humidity is                    important in many areas of atmospheric research.  Most existing                 instrumentation does not have adequate sensitivity or time                      response for measurements at high altitudes or in cold regions,                 or for flux measurements in the surface layer.  The purpose of                  this research is to study the development of a high resolution                  infrared absorption sensor for fast-response measurement of                     water vapor, utilizing a liquid nitrogen-cooled lead-salt diode                 laser.                                                                               In Phase I of this SBIR program, a multiple pass                           absorption cell design which has excellent alignment stability                  was demonstrated for application to water vapor measurements.                   A set of absorption lines was identified which can be used to                   achieve a very wide dynamic range sufficient to accommodate                     measurements of humidity under all expected conditions in the                   troposphere or lower stratosphere.  Accurate measurements of                    the integrated line strengths for these lines were made in                      Phase I.  The major objectives of the Phase II SBIR research                    are to study methods for simplifying the instrument design                      using infrared fiber optics and to enhance measurement accuracy                 by using a dual-beam method.  A prototype humidity sensor will                  be assembled for laboratory and local field tests.  These tests                 will include detailed evaluations of sensitivity, accuracy, and                 time response, including intercomparison with other                             instrumentation used for water vapor measurements in                            atmospheric or meteorological research.",
