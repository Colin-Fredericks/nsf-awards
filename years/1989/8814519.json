 "awd_abstract_narration": "Study of the photochemistry of ozone has been an important                 subject ever since it was realized that the protection from                     ultraviolet radiation afforded by ozone in the upper atmosphere                 is of more than academic interest.  Only since the early 1970's                 has public awareness reached the point where newspapers                         routinely carry stories about possible ozone depletion in                       various regions of the atmosphere.  With the recognition of the                 Antarctic ozone hole and the newly published report on                          significant world wide ozone reduction, the need to improve our                 understanding of all ozone related processes has been                           dramatically underscored.  It is important to understand all                    the sources of ozone production, because to the extent that                     there may be sources that are not included in the models, the                   loss mechanisms could be even more significant than has been                    assumed.                                                                             Current atmospheric models of the upper stratosphere and                   the mesosphere are not able to predict ozone concentrations as                  large as are observed.  This project will experimentally                        examine the hypothesis that photodissociation of vibrational                    excited molecular, oxygen, created in the dissociation of                       ozone, may provide an auto-catalytic source of ozone in the                     upper atmosphere.  Confirmation of the hypothesis could resolve                 the current discrepancy of the models with observations.",
