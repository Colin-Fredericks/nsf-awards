 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emerging field of biotechnology has resulted in the need for                the establishment of engineering principles for the manufacture                 of proteins, cells and other cell products.  This field is also                 expanding into the area of tissue engineering.  Critical for the                development of this field is a forum where engineers and                        scientists can present and discuss scientific and engineering                   principles for both animal cell culture processes and tissue                    engineering.  To facilitate this, the Engineering Foundation has                agreed to sponsor this conference in Santa Barbara, California,                 from December 3 to December 8, 1989.                                                                                                                            The participants of the conference are to be from various                       universities, industries and government laboratories.  A special                effort is to be made to attract young investigators.",
