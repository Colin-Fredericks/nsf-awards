 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an ocean engineering proposal to perform a feasibility                  study of the integration of a borehole televiewer (BHTV) with a                 borehole wireline re\u001a.\u001aentry system.                                                                                                                            The proposers have received previous funding from NSF and DARPA                 (APL/JHU) to develop the capability to re.enter boreholes drilled               into the seafloor utilizing a deep sea vehicle supported by an                  electromechanical cable (wireline).                                                                                                                             This proposal is to perform the preliminary engineering studiesto               determine how a BHTV could be integrated into the re.entry                      vehicle.  BHTV's are acoustic devices that scan the inner walls                 of drill holes.  The acoustic signals are converted into                        imagesthat can be used to interpret the sedimentary and                         metamorphic layering as well as the shape of the hole                           (ellipticity and breakouts).  These images can then be used for                 both scientific and operational purposes.  Interpretation of the                hole shape and breakouts can be used to determine stress and                    direction of stress within the drilled section.  The status of                  hole condition and locations of various layers is also useful                   operational information since it may help to locate areas that                  may be in question for subsequent measurement and may indicate                  whether a certain toll would be useful in a particular location.                                                                                                In an effort to improve reliability over existing BHTV's,                       proposers will also investigate the basic sensor design to                      determine if the standard acoustic narrow beam rotating headcan                 be replaced by multiple, simultaneously monitored non\u001a.\u001arotating                preformed beams.                                                                                                                                                If proven feasible, subsequent proposal(s) would be expected for                the further design, construction and testing of the system.
