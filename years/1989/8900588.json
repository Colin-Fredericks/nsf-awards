 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is a systematic reassessment of the role of               dinitrogen fixation in the upper layers of the open ocean using                 diazotrophic cyanobacteria.  Nitrogen fixation in the open ocean                is potentially a major source of nitrogen in seawater, and one of               the few ways in which atmospheric nitrogen is transferred to the                sea.  A procedural redesign of the actylene reduction assay for                 nitrogenase activity will be undertaken so that unconcentrated                  seawater samples can be used for study.  The new technique has to               be perfected, tested and calibrated in the laboratory first.                    Second the technique will be field tested in local waters near                  Woods Hole and in a two week field study in the Sargasso Sea.                   %%%                                                                             The fixation of nitrogen by marine organisms in the open ocean is               one of the few pathways by which nitrogen in the atmosphere is                  transferred to the sea.  Because nitrogen is the fertilizing                    element most often in short supply in the sea, its concentration                often determines the amount of primary production that can take                 place in the open ocean.  In areas of the ocean where nitrogen is               especially scarce, microorganisms have been found that convert                  atmospheric nitrogen to their own tissues.  The methods used for                measuring nitrogen fixation are old and have problems.  An                      attempt will be made to develop and test new methods that are                   more sensitive and less invasive than previous approaches.",
