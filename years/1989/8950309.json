 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over a three-year period, the PRISE project of Grand Valley State               University will coordinate the efforts of a team of scientists and              educators in the design and implementation of a model program of                environment oriented, hands-on science education for preservice                 elementary teachers.  The goals of PRISE (Project to Improve Science            Education) are to use the region's water resources to increase the              students' interest, knowledge, and confidence with science; increase the        students' understanding of the relationships between science, technology        and society; teach science content appropriate to the elementary                classroom; combine the teaching of science content with the process             approach; and motivate and encourage preservice elementary teachers to          elect a major or minor in science.  PRISE is intended to serve as a             model which may be readily transferred to other regions of the nation           where locally prominent resources may serve as the program focus.               Transfer will be facilitated by special written and video materials.                                                                                            The cost sharing will be fifteen percent of the NSF portion.",
