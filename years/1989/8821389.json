 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to examine the generality of recent             findings regarding exchange rate variability and to increase the number         of observations of distinct international monetary regimes by the               assembly of a new data set for the interwar period.  The study consists         of four components.  The first involves the gathering and assembling            the relevant macroeconomic and financial data for the interwar period.                                                                                          The remaining three components will utilize the data to analyze the             interwar experience.  Part two will analyze the statistical properties          of and relationships among exchange rates and interest rates.  The goal         will be to determine whether market efficiency and similar                      relationships differed across exchange rate regimes.  Part three will           analyze the relationship of the exchange rate system to the business            cycle, with the goal of determining whether the form of the exchange            rate system had an independent impact on cyclical fluctuations.  The            fourth part will focus on the origins, operation, and demise of the             interwar system of pegged rates, with goal of identifying domestic and          international preconditions for the establishment and successful                maintenance of fixed-rate systems.                                              $$$                                                                             A disturbing feature of the system of floating, but managed exchange            rates that has prevailed since 1973 is the surprising degree of                 exchange rate variability.  In fact, exchange rates                             have been much more volatile than early proponents of exchange                  rate flexibility anticipated.  Some have argued that recent                     increases in exchange rate volatility and the concurrent growth                 of international trade imbalances are the direct consequences of                abandoning the fixed exchange rate regimes of the Bretton Woods                 System.  However, it is not at all clear why exchange have become               more volatile or that this was necessarily a bad thing, given the               magnitude of recent shocks to the international monetary system.                This research is important because it will provide a better                     understanding of the operating properties of alternative exchange               rate regimes.  The study will involve the assembly and analysis                 of relevant macroeconomic and international financial data for                  the interwar period.  Gathering and analyzing these data will                   help other scholars as well as policy makers to draw sounder                    conclusions about the benefits and costs of alternative exchange                rate arrangements.",
