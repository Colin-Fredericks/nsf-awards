 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insect pests of agricultural plants often show a tendency to               form new populations on new, previously uninfested plant species.               An example is the apple maggot fly, which is a native insect that               originally infested fruits of native hawthorn trees but began                   infesting apples about 125 years ago.  As a result of research                  carried out over the last 20 years, it has become clear that the                original hawthorn fly populations and the new populations on                    apple are genetically different from one another.  This finding                 has important implications for both agriculture and evolutionary                biology.  Evolutionary biology predicts that populations on new                 food plants, like the apple population of the apple maggot fly,                 may continue to accumulate genetic differences and eventually                   become different species.   This prediction is suggested by the                 observation that there are many close relatives of the apple                    maggot fly living on fruits such as blueberry, snowberry, dogwood               berries, and other plants.                                                           The purpose of the current research is to determine how many               species related to the apple maggot fly actually exist in the                   southern United States, and determine their genetic similarity to               the apple maggot fly.  This is important for two reasons.  First,               the southern species are extremely similar to the apple maggot                  fly, and will reveal the first steps in the evolution of new                    species.  Second, production of blueberries and other fruit is                  increasing in the South and control of the fruit flies of these                 crops is impeded by current ignorance of the number and basic                   biology of these flies.",
