 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms                 of this posttranscriptional regulation as part of the long-term                 objective to understand the control of organelle gene                           expression and the role of the nuclear genome in this process.                  Dr. Gruissem will examine in detail the function of inverted                    repeat (IR) sequences at the 3' end on plastid mRNAs.  These IR                 sequences are ubiquitous, their sequences is conserved between                  evolutionary divergent plants, and they do not act as efficient                 transcription terminators, but homogeneous plastid mRNA 3` ends                 are established by processing.  Preliminary experiments suggest                 that proteins bind to the 3` IR sequences, and their abundance                  changes during plant development are correlated with                            differential mRNA accumulation.  This RNA: protein interaction                  is of interest, because it may delinaeate a novel regulatory                    mechanism in the control of plastid gene expression.                                                                                                            This work should provide new results to help fill the gap that                  currently exists in our understanding of posttranslational                      regulatory mechanisms.  Additionally the studies may                            potentially lead to new insights into the role of the nuclear                   genome in the control of organelle expression.",
