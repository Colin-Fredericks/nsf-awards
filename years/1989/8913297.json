This fact has                 lead many researchers on narrative skills to presuppose the                     notion of event.  The present study asks whether appearances may                not be deceiving; whether children and adult's similar linguistic               means function in fundamentally different ways.                                                                                                                      In the first phase of the study adults and children aged                   4-5, 7-8, and 10-11 will watch a short cartoon and then narrate                 the story to a same-age listener.  Analyses of verbal and                       gestural transcripts will focus on the linguistic devices for                   conveying temporal structure in narrative, and on the use of non-               representational gestures which adults produce when they are                    introducing and commenting on narrative events.  In the second                  phase, the same subjects will be presented with stills from the                 stimulus cartoon and asked to \"group the pictures that belong                   together\".  Event groupings will be compared with a frame-                      by-frame analysis of the stimulus cartoon, and with each                        subject's choice of temporal conjunctions and placement of                      beats and deictic gestures.                                                                                                                                          In this way, this study begins to find out how children                    convey the interrelationship of events in narrative with the                    linguistic and gestural means at their disposal, and contributes                to an understanding of the interaction between cognitive ability                and linguistic skills in the development of narrative competence.",
