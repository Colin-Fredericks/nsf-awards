 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to set up an undergraduate                        Developmental Biology research laboratory to be used primarily by               undergraduate Honors students.  The goal of the project is to                   promote a critical and independent scientific approach during the               execution of laboratory experiments in developmental biology by a               group of students who are both motivated and likely to enter some               profession related to Biology or other science.  The funds from                 this award will be used to equip a laboratory with the                          instrumentation to carry out several projects each lasting                      several weeks over the semester.  The projects will involve                     experiments on 1.) Differentiation in cell culture; 2.) Gene                    expression in Drosophila, in vitro fertilization; 3.) Maternal                  control of development; 4.) Induction of genes during                           development.  The instrumentation was selected on the basis of                  the projects proposed by the faculty as being suitable for                      execution by advanced undergraduate students.  The major                        instruments include a variety of quality microscopes and video                  recording and imaging equipment for the detailed analysis of                    morphological and subcellular events. Gel electrophoresis                       equipment of the analysis of proteins and nucleic acids.                        Centrifuges, spectrophotometer, incubators, and balances for the                preparation, isolation and characterization of material.  The                   grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from                  non-Federal sources.",
