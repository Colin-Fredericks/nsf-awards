 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquefaction is a major cause of structural                                     damage during earthquakes. (Liquefaction is a                                   loss of shear strength of soils during strong                                   ground shaking).                                                                                                                                                The accepted procedure for assessing                                            liquefaction hazard is the \"simplified                                          procedure for evaluating liquefaction                                           potential\" developed by Seed and Idriss.                                        Recent observations indicate that this                                          procedure may overestimate the liquefaction                                     hazard for earthquakes of Richter magnitude                                     6.5 or less.  Since modifications to a design                                   to prevent liquefaction damage are usually                                      expensive, any overestimate of the                                              liquefaction hazard is economically                                             undesirable.                                                                                                                                                    The objective of this research program is to                                    examine the hypothesis that the magnitude                                       scaling factors used in this simplified                                         procedure are too small for moderate                                            earthquakes.  This objective is achieved by                                     analyzing field performance data, and                                           statistically deriving magnitude scaling                                        factors that are consistent with observed                                       performance.                                                                                                                                                    The tasks being addressed include, (1) the                                      analysis of sites where geotechnical data                                       have been collected, and where ground motions                                   have been recorded at or near the site; (2)                                     supplementing these few histories by drilling                                   and testing additional sites where ground                                       motions and past liquefaction behavior are                                      known, and (3) reanalyzing tabulated case                                       histories.                                                                                                                                                      This research program is expected to reduce                                     the calculated hazards to a level consistent                                    with observed field behavior, leading to less                                   costly though equally safe design and                                           construction.",
