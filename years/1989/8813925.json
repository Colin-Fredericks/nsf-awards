 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research             project in earth sciences between Nada Horvatincic of the Rudjer                Boskovic Institute and Henry S. Chafetz of the University of Houston            is to study the physical and chemical surficial processes                       influencing the formation of freshwater carbonate deposits                      (travertines) in waterfalls.  Joint field trips in the USA and                  Yugoslavia are an integral part of the research plan and will enable            the investigators to compare the geology, geochronological and                  environmental conditions favoring the development of such deposits.                                                                                             This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The grants are            composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to               Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
