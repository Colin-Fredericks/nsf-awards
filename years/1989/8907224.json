 "awd_abstract_narration": "In all democratic systems, policy outcomes are essentially the product          of coalition formation and bargaining within the legislature.  After a          flurry of basic research on these topics in the 1960's and early                1970's, there has been very little progress in our understanding of the         phenomena.  However, recent analytical advances in theory have opened           up new avenues for productive research.                                                                                                                         This research focuses on two logically distinct issues.  The first              concerns the role of uncertainty in legislative bargaining among                parties in parliamentary democracies.  In earlier work, the                     investigators explored the consequences of a particular type of                 bargaining institution when no party in a three-party legislature held          a majority of seats.  In this institution, the researchers assumed that         the largest party was given the first opportunity to form a coalition           government, proposing a policy to implement and a distribution of               portfolios.  If this party failed, then the next largest party was              offered a similar opportunity, and so on.  The researchers discovered           that if there was no uncertainty about parties' objectives and                  relative evaluations of policy and portfolio, then the largest party            would always form a coalition government successfully with the smallest         party.  Evidently, this does not always happen.  One natural way to             develop the model further, one which offers the possibility of                  predicting a richer set of legislative outcomes, is to make the more            realistic assumption that not all facets of a party's objectives are            known for sure by every other party.  This development is the first             issue that the investigators are studying under this award.                                                                                                     The second issue concerns the role of portfolios in legislative                 outcomes.  In the above referenced work, \"portfolios\" were                      characterized simply as perqs of office.  Because the investigators             assumed that policies had a very simple structure (viz. points on a             line), this characterization was sensible.  However, real policies are          complex and portfolios are essentially allocations of rights and                responsibilities for choosing certain aspects of overall policy.                Recognizing this, the researchers are studying the strategic                    properties of a variety of institutions for determining how portfolios          are allocated in coalition governments, and what policies they                  subsequently generate.  Preliminary work already reveals that minority          governments can occur and be stable under such institutions:  hitherto,         finding a theoretical model that can predict minority governments has           proved elusive.",
