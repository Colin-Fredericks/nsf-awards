 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals frequently make sacrifices that may benefit other members               of their species.  Evolutionary considerations suggest that such                altruistic behaviors are especially likely to be evident in the                 interactions of close genetic kin.  Because kin descend from the                same ancestors, they possess many genes in common.  By aiding                   their close relatives, individuals thus can propagate copies of                 their own genes.  A prediction of this theory is that organisms                 should discriminate, where possible, between their close kin and                other members of their species, and they should direct beneficial               acts primarily toward their close relatives.  An understanding of               the mechanisms by which animals recognize their kin is important                for evaluating theories of the origin and evolution of social                   behavior.                                                                                                                                                       Dr. Waldman is investigating how kin-recognition abilities                      develop in vertebrates.  Because their developmental patterns are               well understood, amphibian larvae are excellent animals for                     exploring factors influencing development.  Dr. Waldman will                    study the responses of tadpoles that are exposed as embryos to                  various artificial odorants to determine whether or not early                   experience of environmental factors has long-lasting behavioral                 effects.  Of course, embryos are normally in contact with                       maternal factors during early development, and cues important for               developing kin-recognition abilities may be acquired from the                   mother.  By transplanting ovaries between genetically unrelated                 females, and later testing the behavioral responses of the                      foster-siblings thus created, Dr. Waldman will examine the extent               to which the mother influences the development of kin-recognition               abilities in her offspring.  To see if individuals may learn the                odors of their siblings at later stages in development, tadpoles                will be reared individually in special containers.  They will be                exposed to water conditioned by either their siblings or non-                   siblings, and their subsequent behavioral responses will be                     recorded to determine whether or not individuals can be induced                 to recognize non-kin rather than kin if they are previously                     exposed to their odors.                                                                                                                                         This study should demonstrate how the development of kin-                       recognition abilities results from the interaction of genetic and               non-genetic factors.  The results may provide insight into how                  higher vertebrates acquire the ability to recognize their                       relatives.  Moreover, the results should strengthen our under-                  standing of how nepotistic behaviors evolve in vertebrate                       populations.",
