The principal                   objectives of this laboratory are:  (1) To provide students with                opportunities for investigating the operational characteristics of              a variety of thermo-mechanical sensors and actuators; (2) To                    introduce students to methods by which the signals detected by                  ideal as well as non-ideal transducers can be processed to recover              information about a point or region in a specimen which may or may              not be adjacent to the measurement point; (3) To provide                        appropriate software for modeling the response of a sensor; and                 (4) To provide students the opportunity for designing, fabricating              and verifying the operation of a sensor meeting specific design                 objectives.  The principal pieces of equipment necessary to                     establish this laboratory include:  (a) sensor and actuator                     systems; (b) signal excitation, detection, and measuring                        equipment; and (c) data acquisition and processing instruments.                 Experiments are planned for a broad range of transducer                         technologies.  Students will learn experimental methods for                     determining a sensor's spatial and temporal transfer                            characteristics.",
