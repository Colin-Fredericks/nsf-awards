 "awd_abstract_narration": "In his 1939 presidential address to the American Sociological                   Association, Indiana University sociologist Edwin Sutherland                    voiced concern over the dearth of research on \"crime in the                     upper, or white-collar, class.\"  The term \"white collar crime\"                  has since become an established part of our vocabulary.  The                    growth of the modern corporation, the expansion of professional                 classes, the advent of computer technologies, and the increasing                complexity and interdependence of national and international                    financial markets have brought about changes in the form of                     crime with which Sutherland was concerned.  In response, the                    study of white-collar crime has become an important field of                    research in its own right.  Research has been sporadic, however,                and there is a need to take stock of the scholarship over the                   years and begin to map out a strategy for the future.                                                                                                           Under this grant, a conference will be convened in May of 1990 at               Indiana University to assess the field of reserch on white-collar               crime fifty years after Sutherland's 1939 address.  The purpose                 of the conference is to address the theoretical, empirical, and                 practical issues facing the study and control of white-collar                   crime.  Panelists from around the world will convene for three                  days to (1) review the research which has taken place over the                  years; (2) provide new research and information which will be                   useful to both scholars and practitioners interested in the                     control of white-collar crime; (3) identify gaps in our present                 state of knowledge and suggest directions for future research;                  and (4) develop a network of individuals interested in the study                and regulation of white-collar crime so as to facilitate research               and public policy efforts in this area.                                                                                                                         The problem of white-collar crime raises important theoretical                  issues ranging from organizational theories of deviance to micro-               level theories of decisionmaking.  Organizational traits such as                hierarchical structures, reward structures, operating policies                  and procedures, and codes of ethics integrated with subcultural,                opportunity, labeling, and control theories offer exciting                      possibilities for accounting for differences in criminogenic                    organizations and their more law-abiding counterparts.  This                    conference will bring together scholars across different                        disciplines to discuss new research relating to etiology,                       enforcement strategies, international perspectives and                          methodological issues which will provide directions for future                  research in this important field.",
