 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationships between the combinatorial and algebraic structure of          problems, and their computational complexity are being studied.  This           investigation is using several approaches and concepts applicable to            many types of problems in the mainstream of computer science and                operations research.  These include: expressing problems either in a            finite algebraic or nonserial dynamic programming framework, efficient          size-bounded reductions, local reductions, the concepts of polynomial           and power index, several hypotheses on the complexity of SAT and                relater problems, the computation dags associated with problem                  instances including their layouts in the plane, separator trees, the            tight coupling of problems to resource-bounded computations, and                various concepts of \"nearness\".  The problem areas being considered             include combinatorial problems, problems for finite or finitely                 presented algebraic structures, problems for recursively or                     hierarchically presented objects, and problems for several particularly         important infinite algebraic structures.",
