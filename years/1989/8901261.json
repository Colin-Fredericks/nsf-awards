 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the techniques used in solving engineering problems                     such as system identification are valid for linear systems.                     However, in certain engineering applications on nonlinear                       systems one must consider nonlinear effects.  In addition input                 loading on some systems such as soil or building, offshore                      platforms etc., can be viewed as random and are usually                         difficult to predict or characterize by traditional means.                                                                                                      This project is to develop a general system identification                      approach to characterize and analyze nonlinear systems with                     unknown and unmeasured random input.  The proposed studies                      will extend and verify the effectiveness of the random                          decrement technique to cover the non-stationary cases.  Such                    applications make it possible to use this procedure to analyze                  nonlinear system problems.  In addition the nonlinear form of                   the system and system signature will be identified from the                     measured system responses without knowing the random input.                     The effectiveness of this general approach will be investigated                 by laboratory simulation.                                                                                                                                       The new technique developed would improve our ability to                        investigate and predict the seismic response of soil and building               taking into account the nonlinear effect of the soil-building                   system.",
