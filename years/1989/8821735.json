The prior research effort has                             identified specific issues requiring additional study                           before wide spread utilization by the design profession                         is possible.                                                                                                                                                    This research project establishes the conditions and                            limits whereby equivalent viscous damping can be used                           to represent various damping device energy dissipation                          characteristics, demonstrates that supplemental damping                         devices can effectively reduce both elastic and                                 inelastic response of multistory buildings, and                                 initiates building code subcommittee consideration of                           appropriate provisions for utilitization of                                     supplemental damping devices in earthquake resistant                            design.  The results achieved in this effort in                                 combination with previous conclusions will provide the                          background information necessary for acceptance by the                          design profession of added damping as a valuable                                alternative for earthquake resistant construction.",
