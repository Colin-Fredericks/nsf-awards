 "awd_abstract_narration": "Herbivores can strongly influence plant fitness, population                dynamics, and community structure.  Plant responses to herbivory                vary along a continuum depending on the spatial/temporal patterns               of defoliation and the competitive neighborhood or physical                     environment of the defoliated plant.  The proposed research will                1) assess the consequences of bison herbivory on tiller growth,                 reproduction, clonal spread, and survivorship of tallgrasses                    (Panicum virgatum and Andropogon gerardii) and 2) determine the                 interacting effects of competitors, spatial and temporal patterns               of defoliation, and fire on plant responses to bison herbivory on               a prairie.  The  studies will test the hypothesis that the                      effects of fire and biotic neighborhood variation alter                         responses to grazing and that the relative grazing tolerances of                different species change under different fire regimes.                          Vegetative growth, seed reproduction, and clonal growth                         performance, and plant responses over  two growing seasons will                 be measured to determine long-term effects of herbivory on                      individuals and populations and whether a single herbivore may                  have opposite or congruent effects on different plant life                      history stages.  These experiments will examine proximal                        consequences of herbivory on herbaceous plants and plant growth                 form and how abiotic and biotic interactions influence plant                    responses to herbivory.  They will also provide insight into the                interactions of grazing and fire effects on tallgrass prairie                   perennials, and its consequences for individual clone success and               species relative abundances.  This proposed project is part of a                longer-term research program that will more fully address                       patterns of variation in responses to herbivory among species and               among years.",
