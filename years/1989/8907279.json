 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This contract continues support for an independent                oversight panel of the National Academy of Sciences/National                    Research Council to assess progess and results of cooperative                   research projects under the U.S.-India Science and Technology                   Initiative (STI).  The oversight panel will be responsible for                  evaluating progress in the four basic areas of STI:  Health,                    Agriculture, Solid State Science and Engineering, Monsoon Research;             and new initiatives in infectious diseases (AIDS, Neurological                  Disorders, Leishmaniasis), the 1987 Monsoon Drought, and                        cooperation on the Superconducting Supercollider.  The Oversight                Panel will report annually its findings directly to the U.S. Senior             Policy Group (SPG) chaired by the President's Science Adviser.                  Panel members will interact with program coordinators of the STI                research areas, with the Senior Policy Group, and with the                      counterpart Indian oversight panel. The proposal was submitted in               response to RFP ESS 89-002.                                                                                                                                     As Executive Agent for STI, the NSF's Division of International                 Programs is responsible for supporting the NAS/NRC oversight panel              as set forth in the January 1983 Scientific Panel Report to                     President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which                 established this initiative.  Since 1983, the STI has been renewed              twice, most recently, in October 1988 for a three year period.  In              view of the importance of this Presidential scientific initiative               and the usefulness of panel evaluations in 1985 and 1988, the NSF               recommends continued support.",
