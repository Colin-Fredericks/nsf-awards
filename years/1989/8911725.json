Conference sessions are                         scheduled on physical, chemical and biological processes                        and systems for treatment of chemical pollutants, including                     new oxidative and reductive methods for destruction of                          hydrocarbons of hazardous significance.                                                                                                                         This conference is the seventh in a series that was                             initiated in 1976.  Dr. Lacy has had a significant role in                      this series, representing the United States.  His                               participation is expected to  be helpful in obtaining                           information that is relevant to the NSF Environmental                           Systems program's exploration of new methods for                                destruction of hazardous hydrocarbons in aqueous systems.",
