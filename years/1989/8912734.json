 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an investigation of metal-support interactions in                       platinum/zeolite-L using a combination of physical and                          chemical probes.  Attempts are made to characterize the                         interactions between platinum particles and zeolite-L using X-                  ray absorption (both near-edge (XANES) and fine-structure                       (EXAFS) spectroscopies) and nuclear magnetic resonance of                       hydrogen-1 and carbon-13.  Results of these studies are                         correlated with catalytic activity and chemisorption involving                  hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, benzene, and toluene.  Test                  reactions used include the isomerization and hydrogenolysis of                  C-6 alkanes, competitive hydrogenation of benzene-toluene                       mixtures, and selective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde.  To                    provide points of reference, many of these measurements will                    also be done using platinum on zeolite-Y and platinum on                        silica.  The reaction studies are done in collaboration with                    Dr. Daniel Resasco of the University of Mar del Plata in                        Argentina.                                                                                                                                                      Catalysts based on zeolite-L and containing platinum-group                      metals represent the newest generation of reforming catalysts                   used to upgrade gasoline in refineries.  Both oil and catalyst                  companies are actively seeking new formulations, but                            systematic studies are rare.  This work not only sheds light                    on how these systems work, but could possibly lead directly to                  improved formulations.",
