 "awd_abstract_narration": "The retina of the eye contains photoreceptors, and in many                      organisms the sensitivity of the retina to light can change.  The               horseshoe crab, Limulus, is an animal that has been used for many               years as a model for vision because it has particularly large                   compound eyes, with large cells that are relatively accessible                  for physiological and biochemical studies.  In Limulus, retinal                 sensitivity is regulated by two factors, light itself, which                    decreases the sensitivity, and nerves coming from the brain to                  the eye, called efferent innervation, which increase the                        sensitivity of the eye to light.                                                                                                                                This project addresses the largely unknown biochemical mechanisms               initiated by light and by efferent innervation in Limulus                       photoreceptors, and explores their interactions at the                          intracellular level.  In particular, changes produced in                        intracellular calcium ion concentration profoundly influence                    photoreceptor sensitivity.  Internal calcium may exert its                      effects by calcium regulation of enzyme processes, such as                      protein kinase activity and protein phosphorylation.  Biochemical               tools are used to isolate and characterize one of the interesting               calcium-activated kinases (known as CaCAM-PK) that also may                     remain active even in the absence of further calcium elevation.                 This property means this kinase can be a kind of molecular                      activating switch.  Another protein kinase studied depends on                   calcium and phospholipid, and acts on photoreceptor proteins.                   These studies will contribute significantly to our knowledge of                 how the sensitivity of photoreceptors is regulated, and also how                calcium influences the function of cells in general.",
