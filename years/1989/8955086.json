 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Appalachian College Program, administered by the University of              Kentucky, will hold a conference for science and mathematics faculty            from 38 private colleges throughout central Appalachia.  The purpose            of the conference is to allow discussion of the benefits of                     collaboration in science education and to identify specific ways in             which this group of colleges might collaborate to improve science               education on the campuses.  A keynote speaker will set the tone at an           opening dinner for the small group sessions to be held on the next              day.  Proposals and recommendations made in group sessions will be              presented and approved on the morning of the following day.  These              recommendations will be presented at a meeting of all of the                    academic deans or vice-presidents of the colleges and a similar                 meeting of all the presidents of the colleges.  In addition, a                  report will be produced outlining the role of these colleges in                 science education and the resources needed to fulfill that role.                                                                                                The consortium and member colleges will contribute an additional 15%            of the award toward the operation of the project.",
