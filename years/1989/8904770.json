 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigation of the earliest events in embryonic polarization in               plants have focused on two genera of closely related brown algae,               Fucus and Pelvetia. Current working hypotheses postulate that                   during polarization ion channels in the plasma membrane migrate                 to one end of the egg. This asymmetry gives rise to net influx in               the region of channel accumulation and net efflux from the other                end. Thus, an ionic current flows through the egg and denotes                   formation of the developmental axis. As a consequence of the                    current, cytoplasmic voltage and ionic gradients are established                and these are thought to regulate regional differentiation within               the egg. One major aspect of this attractive model that has yet                 to be scrutinized is whether a physical reorganization of plasma                membrane components (e.g.ion channels) takes place as the axis                  is established. Dr. Kropf has recently shown that Fucus                         protoplasts made from young zygotes can be polarized with                       unidirectional light. This provides direct access to the plasma                 membrane during axis establishment. He will examine                             rearrangements of membrane receptors on the surface of                          protoplasts undergoing polarization and investigate ionic                       currents generated by the membrane asymmetries in Fucus zygotes                 and in photopolarized protoplasts. The ultimate goal is to                      monitor the spatial distributions of ionic currents, plasma                     membrane receptors and F-actin in single cells as they establish                an axis.                                                                        %%%                                                                             The establishment of the axis (i.e. which end is which) of an                   organism early in development is a fundamental first step in the                pattern formation of that organism. This event has been hard to                 analyze in plants. Dr. Kropf is studying this process in the                    brown algae because of the experimental advantages it presents                  relative to many other plants.",
