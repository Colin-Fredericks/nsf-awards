 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current research in geometric modeling has focused on extending the             coverage of geometric modeling systems.  The most difficult obstacle in         extending the coverage has been integrating freeform surfaces into a            system that allows Boolean set operations such as intersection and              union.  This project is concerned with the design and implementation of         a small-scale geometric modeling system based on algebraic volumes,             those sets that can be described as the intersection, union, and                difference of algebraic halfspaces (solutions to polynomial                     inequalities).  In particular, the project involves:                                                                                                                 Design and implementation of algorithms for creating freeform                   algebraic volumes (the 3D analog of freeform algebraic surfaces).               These algorithms will be based on recent advances in the theory of              polynomial spline spaces.                                                                                                                                       Design and implementation of algorithms for tessellating algebraic              volumes.  Application tasks such as rendering and finite element                analysis will operate on the resulting tessellation.                                                                                                            Design and implementation of algorithms for performing finite                   element analysis on algebraic volumes.  These algorithms would                  analyze the structural and thermal properties of the modeled                    object.                                                                                                                                                         The resulting system would allow the design and analysis of a              range of geometric objects not covered under current geometric modeling         systems.",
