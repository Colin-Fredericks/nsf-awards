 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovak research project                between Dr. Josef Michl of the University of Texas, Austin, and Dr.             Stanislav Hermanek of the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, Rez, is             to explore several aspects of the phyiscal inorganic chemistry of               boranes.  Upper electronic state spectroscopy will be employed to               examine a large number of closo, nido and arachno boranes.                      Additionally, calculations of excited state energies and                        wavefunctions, vibrational information, and results from studies of             matrix-isolated reactive intermediates will be drawn upon to                    characterize boranes.  Through study of boranes chemistry the                   researchers expect to determine principles of behavior for electron             defuicient molecules and to create an order, similar to that                    already available for electron-satisfied elements derived through               study of the chemistry of carbon.                                                                                                                               This project in inorganic chemistry fulfills the program objective              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in                the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                   talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                   interest and competence.",
