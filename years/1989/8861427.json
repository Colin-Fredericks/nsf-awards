 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continued development of construction productivity, quality, and                worker safety depends on innovative technology in computational                 geometry, computer science, data acquisition and monitoring,                    metrology, and control, in addition to traditional construction                 process technology.  ConSolve is developing an operations control               system for earthmoving types of construction, with the principal                focus on hazardous waste site clean up.  This system exploits                   advanced computer science, modern metrology technology, and                     computer based machine controllers on existing construction                     equipment.  Much of the algorithmic development and software                    implementation of this site control system is complete, but the                 technology needs to be physically tested.  This project will                    exercise the site controller system on a 1/20.scale physical                    testbed of an earthmoving site.  The project has four tasks: (1)                to exercise the communication and location system for vehicles,                 (2) to evaluate the feasibility for automated site surveying, (3)               to download cutpath instructions from a central CAE system and                  control vehicles accordingly, and (4) to evaluate a dynamic                     surface model of site operations.",
