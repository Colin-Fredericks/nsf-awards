 "awd_abstract_narration": "Only a small fraction of American high school students today take               physics.   Recognizing this, a partnership of University professors,            high school teachers, and industrial scientists and engineers will              develop teaching materials and strategies to enhance secondary-level            physics education through the integration of mathematical and                   technological applications into the curriculum.  Instructional                  materials needed to accomplish this will be defined, developed, field           tested in a number of cooperating school districts, and disseminated.           Materials developed will include suitable laboratory experiments.               High school physics, mathematics, and technology teachers will work             together on the project to insure that materials will appropriately             interrelate these course areas and meet the needs of students across a          broad spectrum of the secondary student population.   Industrial                scientists and engineers will participate fully in the preparation of           the materials; they will help define pertinent examples of current              technology, provide access to industrial laboratories and other                 facilities, and share insights on future directions of technological            development.                                                                                                                                                    Cost sharing by the partners will total 70% of the NSF funding.",
