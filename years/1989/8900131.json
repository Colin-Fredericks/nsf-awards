 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been found, contrary to prevailing thought, that                         herbivorous fishes, particularly two species--Diplodus                          holbrooki and Lagodon rhomboides--are among the most common                     fishes of coastal and continental shelf habitats throughout the                 southeastern United States, and their feeding habits can                        dramatically affect the structure of hard-substrate benthic                     communities.  These fish are also major prey species for                        commercially important species such as snapper and grouper, and                 may be a significant pathway of energy transfer from shallow                    nearshore waters to deeper offshore reefs.  Experimental field                  studies will be conducted to assess 1) the interactions between                 different herbivorous fishes, the interactions between fishes                   and other herbivores, and the effects of these interactions on                  benthic community structure; and 2) the mechanisms that cause                   dramatic increases in the abundance of unpalatable brown                        seaweeds in the presence of herbivorous fishes. These data will                 then be compared with studies already completed on herbivorous                  fish in tropical communities.",
