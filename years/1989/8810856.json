 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agonistic behavior, which includes aggressive behavior and                      responses to aggression, is one of four general categories into                 which the behavior of humans and all other animals can be                       divided.  The ubiquity of agonistic behavior makes it broadly                   relevant not only to basic science but also to practical problems               from the population to the individual level.                                                                                                                    One kind of site-specific agonistic behavior, territoriality, is                particularly amenable to study because its spatial localization                 allows measurement of its costs and benefits under field                        conditions.  However, it is often difficult to evaluate both                    costs and benefits in a common unit that is strongly correlated                 with survival and reproduction.  Dr. Ewald will carry out field                 experiments with one of the few study subjects for which these                  obstacles can be readily surmounted:  hummingbirds defending                    feeding territories.  For this subject, both costs and benefits                 can be quantified in units of energy and experimentally                         manipulated; moreover, the rapid responses of hummingbird                       territoriality to changes in these costs and benefits makes field               experiments exceptionally feasible.                                                                                                                             Dr. Ewald will conduct the first rigorously controlled tests                    designed to resolve three fundamental, unanswered questions about               agonistic behavior.  First, he will assess the utility of                       controlled field experimentation by comparing the territorial                   responses to highly accurate but artificial energy sources with                 responses to the less-controllable natural energy sources.                      Second, he will test predictions about the existence of                         territoriality in relation to the net benefits obtained from the                territory.  Finally, he will determine whether or not the quality               of the best alternative to territoriality influences the presence               and/or form of territoriality.                                                                                                                                  The areas of agreement and divergence between theoretical                       predictions and actual territoriality in this system should                     clarify the applicability of the cost/benefit approach to                       territoriality.  More generally, by helping to develop the                      cost/benefit theory of agonistic behavior, this clarification                   should eventually improve our understanding of the interaction                  between internal and environmental influences on agonistic                      behavior across the entire animal kingdom, including humans.",
