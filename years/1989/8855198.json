The students will conduct                       investigations in the biology and ecology of the migratory                      monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus L.) at a wintering                          colony in southern California.  The thermoregulatory                            behavior, population dynamics, sex ratios,female                                reproductive status, body size, and physical condition will                     be measured.  The species of plants present, as well as the                     height and diameter (dbh) of the trees at the colony will                       be mapped.  The wind speed, air temperature, relative                           humidity, and cloud cover will be recorded during each                          visit and weekly summaries for the site will be obtained                        from the California Department of Parks and Recreation.                              The data will be compared with the information                             gathered during studies conducted in 1987/88 by students                        from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.                          This program will expose high school students to the duties                     of professional ecologists, wildlife managers, and park                         rangers; increase the students's knowledge about the                            educational requirements for a career in the sciences; and                      provide a solid background in the fundamentals of ecology                       and conservation that will enable them to make informed                         decisions about solutions to environmental problems.",
