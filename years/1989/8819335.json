 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past few years, a large body of work has been published                  implicating a specific bidirectional communication between the                  neuroendocrine system and the immune system.  Neuropeptides are                 biosynthesized by immune cells and immune factors with biological               activity are biosynthesized by nerve cells.  Furthermore,                       neuropeptides and in particular opiate peptides are known to                    activate lymphocytes to secrete Interleukins, and Interleukins                  have been found to specifically modulate the biosynthesis and                   release of peptide hormones by the cells of the neuroendocrine                  system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The focus of research in this laboratory is: (A) on the ability                 of normal and activated lymphoid cells to biosynthesize, process                and secrete Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) related peptides; (B) on                 the modulation of POMC expression in lymphoid cells by neural                   signals; and (C) on the modulation of POMC expression in                        neuroendocrine cells by known immune factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                   Experiments in this area of research have provided good evidence                for neuroimmune signaling that leads to physiologically relevant                hormonal responses.  Dr. Zakarian has demonstrated for the first                time, that the regions of the pituitary can be modulated by T                   cell dependent and T cell independent immune mechanisms giving                  rise to contrasting B-endorphin processing patterns in each                     region.  Thus transplantation immunity seems to modulate                        B-endorphin activation in the pars intermedia while Interleukin-1               modulates the activation and release of B-endorphin and ACTH from               the anterior  pituitary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        With these studies, an understanding may be gained of the                       coordinate activation of multiple signals, \"neuro or immuno\",                   that may be essential for the generation of biologically active                 peptide hormones in the immune system and in the neuroendocrine                 system.",
