 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the qualitative structure of                        small-time reachable sets and piecewise regularity properties                   of optimal controls for nonlinear systems.  For single-input                    systems it is known that optimal trajectories can exhibit                       undesirable features such as chattering bang-bang arcs if the                   dimension of the system becomes too large.  This may be due to                  a lack of possibility to influence the system via the control                   vector field.  To explore that scenario this project seeks to                   analyze the local structure of small-time reachable sets in                     dimension n for increasing values of n, in particular, to                       develop tests for optimality of complex concatenations of bang                  and singular arcs, and ii) to investigate multi-input systems                   using higher-order approximating cones which take into account                  specific structures of trajectories under consideration.  The                   underlying technical framework is provided by                                   differential-geometric descriptions and Lie-algebraic                           computational techniques.                                                            The long term aim of this work is to achieve a qualitative                 understanding of the local behavior of nonlinear control                        systems.  Aside from its evident theoretical relevance, such a                  knowledge might also be practically of interest for any                         possible future approach to design involving nonlinear                          components.",
