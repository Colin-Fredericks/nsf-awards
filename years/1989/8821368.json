Bruce, Center                for Tropical Diseases, University of Lowell, to conduct with                    Dr. Bintare Rukmono, Department of Parasitology, University of                  Indonesia, a U.S.-Indonesia seminar on the application of                       biotechnology in the study of animal parasites and their                        vectors.  The joint seminar, involving eight U.S. participants,                 will be held for ten days, June 26 to July 5, 1989, in Jakarta,                 Yogyakarta, and Denpasar, Indonesia.  The purpose of this                       seminar is to bring together for mutual benefit U.S. and                        Indonesian parasitologists to exchange ideas on the study of                    animal parasites and their vectors and to apply new and                         developing technologies to obtain a better understanding of the                 parasites, their vectors, their biology, and life cycles.  In                   addition to reviewing and updating animal parasitosis in                        Indonesia and other countries in the immediate geographical                     region, projections will be made on the application of new tools                in biotechnology to the study of these parasites.                                                                                                               The containment of animal parasites is important to development                 in many tropical countries.  The seminar will provide to U.S.                   scientists information on Indonesian research on zoonotic                       parasites that are not well known to Americans.  There will be                  reviews on biotechnology and the use of biotechnology in the                    study of nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, protozoa, arthropods,                 and mollusks.  For example, there will be a review of nematodes                 followed by papers on the development of monoclonal antibodies                  to detect nematode antigens, the biochemistry of nematodes, the                 use of isoenzymes and probes to detect nematode antigens,                       genetic differences, etc.  It is intended that the seminar will                 be instrumental in fostering future collaborative research and                  training efforts that will be beneficial to U.S. and Indonesian                 parasitologists.  This project is relevant to the objectives of                 the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to                      increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and                   engineers and their counterparts in developing countries through                the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                      techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefit.",
