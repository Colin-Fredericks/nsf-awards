 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment Grant is for the purchase of a              network analyzer system (Hewlett Packard 8510B) to support current              research by the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University          of Mississippi on three specific projects, and it will be used by all           the staff to broaden the scope and quality of their research                    activities.  The requirement for the proposed network analyzer system,          which has already become an industry standard, has been necessitated            by the need to improve measurement accuracy required for verification           through measurements related current research on analytic and                   numerical solution of EM boundary-value problems, because existing              equipment is obsolete.  The equipment will facilitate research in the           specific areas of 1) cavity method for measurement of material                  properties - an investigation to improve accuracy and error estimates           in measurements of dielectric constant and surface conductivity, 2)             antennas embedded in lossy media - an experimental study of wires               inclined to an air-lossy media interface to verify a well-known                 numerical analysis program, and 3) dielectric radiating elements - an           investigation of non-metallic radiating elements for microwave and              millimeter wave applications.  Auxiliary uses for related network               analyzer measurements are in the areas of new antenna feeding                   techniques, phased arrays, and cavity measurements using the resonance          method for dielectric in rectangular waveguide.",
