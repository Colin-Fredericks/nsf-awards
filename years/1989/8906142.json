 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mating activity in many insects is mediated by chemical,                   visual or auditory courtship signals.  Changes in insect                        courtship signals are closely associated with changes in the                    perception of the signals, so that as the signal produced by a                  particular species evolves, so does the perception of the signal.               Divergence in courtship signals between members of different                    populations is one of the evolutionary processes that may                       eventually lead to the formation of new species.  The proposed                  research will provide a genetic analysis of the coupling between                changes in production and perception of chemical courtship                      signals, sex pheromone.  This will be accomplished by a                         comparison of two divergent strains of the fruit fly, Drosophila                melanogaster.  This study will reveal new information about the                 genetic complexity of the relationship between production and                   perception of courtship signals, and about the complexity of                    genetic events that occur during the formation of new species.                       The results of this study will also be applicable to insect                management strategies.  Modern insect management techniques                     often involve the use of an insect's own pheromone to disrupt                   mating activities or to lure the insect to traps.  These                        techniques are effective on a short term basis, but over the long               term insects may evolve resistance through changes in the                       production and perception of specific pheromone.  Knowledge                     about the genetic basis for changes in the production and                       perception of pheromonal courtship signals will help in                         determining whether resistance to pheromonal techniques is likely               to evolve, and how rapidly such evolution might proceed.",
