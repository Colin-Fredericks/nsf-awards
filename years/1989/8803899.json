 "awd_abstract_narration": "The properties of certain S. coelicolor mutants blocked in the                  initiation of sporulation strongly suggest a direct connection                  between carbon-source catabolite repression, activation of                      antibiotic synthesis genes and morphological development.  As a                 starting point for our investigation of how these complex                       metabolic and developmental processes interact, we have chosen to               characterize in detail the regulatory mechanisms that control the               transcriptional activity of the gal operon of S. coelicolor, a                  relatively simple transcription unit that is subject to both                    glucose-mediated catabolite repression and induction by                         galactose.  It is proposed to: 1) purify and characterize the                   polymerase forms that transcribe gal, 2) define the cis-acting                  elements of the operon that determine its regulation, and 3)                    identify and isolate the trans-acting factors that mediate                      repression and induction.                                                                                                                                       Members of the bacterial genus Streptomyces are of enormous                     industrial importance, since they are the source of about 80% of                known antibiotics.  These species are also of great interest                    from a genetic and developmental point of view because of the                   complexity of their life cycle.  When deprived of nutrients,                    these bacteria undergo a complex morphological differentiation                  culminating in the production of dormant spores which can                       germinate when and where environmental conditions favor                         vegetative growth.  The synthesis of antibiotics is intimately                  related to this developmental process, since it occurs during the               development, and since many mutants blocked in development can't                make antibiotics.  It is clear that one of the signals for                      initiation of development is depletion of an easily assimilable                 carbon source, such as glucose. The mechanism whereby this signal               is translated into a decision to begin the developmental process                is not at all understood, but a working hypothesis is that this                 mechanism is related to one by which, during growth on glucose,                 genes whose activity is not essential under these conditions are                shut off.  The mechanism of this type of shutoff has yet to be                  investigated in detail in Streptomyces, but it is already clear                 that it is very different from analogous but much better                        understood mechanisms in other unrelated species of bacteria.                   This proposal to elucidate the mechanism of shutoff of a gene                   unnecessary for growth on glucose is of particular interest                     because of the central importance of this process in the complex                life cycle of this bacterium (which also happens to be a species                of great industrial importance), and is of general interest                     because it may establish new principles of control of gene                      activity.",
