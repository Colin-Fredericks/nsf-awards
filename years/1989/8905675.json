The                       fellowship is designed to provide 24 months of support divided                  into 18 academic months and 3 periods of two summer months.  The                recipient has the option of a Research Instructorship which                     allows the 18 months of academic support to be taken as 9 months                of full-time support and 18 months of half-time support.                        Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship awards                   allow fellows to choose research environments that will have                    maximal impact on their future scientific development.                               Edward Letzter received his doctoral degree from the                       University of Washington, and will pursue research in the area of               associative algebras under the guidance of K. R. Goodearl at the                University of Utah.",
