 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant permits Ms. Laura Levi, under the direction of Dr.                   Patrick Culbert, to conduct her doctoral dissertation research.                 She will carry out archaeological work at the Mayan site of San                 Estevan which is located in the lowland tropics of Belize.  Prior               work by Ms. Levi and others has revealed the presence of a large                series of prehistoric house mounds which date to the height of                  Mayan development.  Ms. Levi will conduct a survey of the site to               determine mound locations.  She will also collect surface                       ceramics and undertake limited archaeological excavation.                       Through use of aerial photographs, microenvironmental zones will                be defined and the size and distribution of mounds related to                   this ecological variable.                                                                                                                                       Ms. Levi postulates that prehistoric lowland Mayan farming is                   based of the detailed knowledge of slightly different                           microenvironmental zones and that success involved use of more                  than one zone.  She also argues that decision making took place                 on a family or household level, and that household success and                  size is directly related to the ability to farm more than one                   zone.  Through comparison of house mound location (in relation to               microenvironment) and size, it is possible to test this                         hypothesis.                                                                                                                                                     This research has great practical value.  The Middle American                   tropical lowlands today permit human occupation at only low                     population densities.  The ancient Maya lived in the same                       environments in much larger numbers and inhabited regions for                   very long periods of time.  Understanding of Mayan agricultural                 practices may permit more effective contemporary use of such                    regions.  This project will also further the career development                 of a very promising young scientist.",
