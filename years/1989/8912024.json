 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study examines the effects of child care as a possible                     constraint on women's subsequent employment.  As women's                        participation in the labor force has increased, there has                       been growing concern about the impacts of the quality,                          reliability and cost of child care on women's employment.                       Using panel data on a nationally representative sample (the                     Survey of Income and Program Participation) and logistic                        regression analysis, this research will explore the effects                     of women's child care arrangements and expenses on the                          likelihood of women leaving the labor force or moving from                      full to part time work.  For women not in the labor force,                      the investigator will examine the influence of expected child                   care expenses, in relation to expected earnings, on the                         likelihood of homemakers subsequently entering employment.                      This study will make an important contribution to our                           knowledge of how working families balance work and family                       obligations, by documenting the effects of child care costs                     and arrangements on women's abilities to maintain an                            attachment to the labor force.",
