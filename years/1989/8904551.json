 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through selection and characterization of nitrate reductase                     deficient mutants it has been demonstrated that barley has two                  nitrate reductase isozymes, one NADH specific and the other                     NAD(P)H bispecific.  Little is known about the importance or                    regulation of NAD(P)H nitrate reductases in barley or other                     cereal species.  This research will 1) develop techniques for                   specifically quantifying NADH and NAD(P)H nitrate reductase                     proteins and mRNAs, and 2) determine the effects of nitrate,                    light and reduced nitrogen on nitrate reductase proteins and                    mRNA using newly developed quantification techniques.  Nitrate                  reductase mRNAs will be determined by using cDNA clones of each                 nitrate reductase as specific probes.  Monoclonal and/or                        monospecific polyclonal antisera will be used to quantify                       nitrate reductase proteins.%%%                                                                                                                                  Many higher plants, especially cereals, obtain nitrogen from                    the soil as nitrate.  Nitrate reductase, a highly regulated                     enzyme, is often considered to be a key limiting step in the                    nitrate assimilation process in plants.  This research will                     identify translational and transcriptional mechanisms which                     regulate specific nitrate reductase in barley.  By developing a                 thorough understanding of the genetic and biochemical processes                 regulating nitrate reduction this research will contribute to                   improved nitrogen use efficiency in crop plants.***//",
