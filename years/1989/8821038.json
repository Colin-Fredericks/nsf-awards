 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support to Prof. Thomas Gardner of              The Pennsylvania State University for a sabbatical stay in Costa                Rica to calculate uplift rates determined from fluvial terrace                  sequences along the northwestern portion of Costa Rica and to                   relate that data to the plate tectonic model for subduction of the              adjacent aseismic Cocos Ridge.  The research should provide                     critical data on crustal uplift rates resulting from \"normal\"                   subduction in northwestern Costa Rica during the time of subduction             of the Cocos Ridge in southeastern Costa Rica.  The proposed site               provides the ideal location for determining the needed tectonic                 data because the Quatenary plate tectonic history of the region is              well known.                                                                                                                                                     The subduction of buoyant, ocean lithosphere in the form of oceanic             plateaus, aseismic ridges, or very young lithosphere may be                     responsible for anomalous tectonic activity along convergent plate              boundaries.  While the latter activity may be broadly understood,               its specific causes and quantifications remain largely                          unaddressed.  The Pacific coast of Costa Rica represents an                     unsurpassed site for a study of one specific case among these                   phenomena: the vertical motions of the crust in proximity to a                  subducting oceanic lithosphere that contains an aseismic ridge.                 This study, which is part of a larger study supported by the NSF,               will involve scientists from the Instituto Geografico Nacional, the             Universidad de Costa Rica, and the Instituto Costarricense de                   Electricidad.  In particular, Prof. Ana Chinchilla of the                       Universidad de Costa Rica will formally participate in the field                work.  By closely involving scientists from Costa Rica in the                   research, this award serves to advance the objectives of the                    Science in Developing Countries Program.",
