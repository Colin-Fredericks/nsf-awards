 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the remarkable scientific trends during the 1980's has                   been the convergent movements of molecular biologists to pursue                 questions of neuroscience and of neuroscientists to pursue                      questions of gene structure and regulation.  The increased                      interactions of these two groups of researchers promises to be                  particularly important in elucidating the molecular bases of                    neural function and the genetic bases of human neurological and                 neuropsychiatric disorders.  The basis for future therapeutic                   products will depend upon gene-based molecular pharmacology to                  produce molecular assays for neural protein systems, upon gene-                 based discovery of new neural systems, and upon engineered                      (transgenic) animal genetic models for human diseases.  Already                 we are aware of our increased power to identify important neural                genes in which defects may lead to recognized deficits in                       behavior or neuronal fitness.  In the last few years, researchers               have made progress in understanding genetic predisposition to                   Huntington's disease, muscular dystrophy, retinal degeneration,                 schizophrenia and manic depression.  Molecular and mechanistic                  understanding should closely follow.  Molecular genetic                         technologies have been used to describe the neuronal receptors                  that are targets for several important pharmaceutical compounds.                These descriptions are leading to more precise assays for                       receptor function while providing explicit structures for                       molecular modeling.                                                                                                                                             This MOLECULAR NEUROGENETICS conference will cover these topics                 by combining presentations about vertebrates and invertebrates,                 cell linages and cell interactions, cell biology, pharmacology,                 electrophysiology, biochemistry, and descriptions of the genetics               underlying several neuropathologies.",
