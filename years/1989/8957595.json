 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Jeffrey S. Banks under the National          Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards Program.            The objective of this program is to provide research support to the             Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and engineering           faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the capability of U.S.             academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified             science and engineering personnel for academic and industrial research          and teaching.                                                                                                                                                   This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research                   concerning the fundamental structure of collective choice and public            institutions.  His theoretical, statistical and experimental work on            this broad topic spans the disciplines of political science and                 economics and methodologically ranges across game theory.  The main             thrust of his current research involves a signaling games approach.             Signaling games are two-person sequential-move games in which the first         mover possesses information concerning payoffs relevant to the second           mover's decision calculus.  They can serve as an appropriate framework          for the study of a variety of economic interactions in which asymmetric         information is available to the participants, among them job market             signaling, limit pricing, predatory behavior, and tax auditing.                 Dr. Banks' early research led to the derivation of well-defined                 refinements of the sequential equilibrium concept which permits                 narrowing the focus of attention to a tractable set of strategies.              Next, he applied the signaling games framework and the selection                criteria to a variety of political economy models including models of           agenda control, electoral competition, legislative oversight, and               regulatory auditing.  He is currently extending his analytic approach           to wider classes of incomplete information games which facilitates              generalization of previous signaling models to a more dynamic setting.          His work is moving toward the development of models which will better           mirror the reality of complex substantive issues in political economy.          Dr. Banks' excellent technical skills along with his broad vision of            the applicability of economic and political concepts offer an important         contribution to the development of knowledge about information                  transmission across electoral, legislative and bureaucratic settings.",
