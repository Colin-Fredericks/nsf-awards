 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall purpose of Dr. Cook's research is to understand how                 different kinds of pattern recognition systems perceive and                     process visual information.  This project contributes to that                   important purpose by studying visual perception in pigeons.                     Birds are ideal for comparative visual studies because flight                   requires accurate and rapid visual perception.  This requirement,               combined with the need to minimize body weight, has produced in                 birds a small, compact visual system that is structurally                       different from that of mammals.                                                                                                                                 Dr. Cook's research investigates how pigeons discriminate                       different kinds of computer-generated visual stimuli.  He is                    using a new type of visual discrimination task, which                           specifically allows the direct comparison of visual perception in               pigeons and humans.  The results of these experiments will reveal               whether the mechanisms proposed for vision in humans are present                in pigeons, or whether the birds use an entirely different set of               mechanisms for producing their extraordinarily keen vision.                                                                                                     Thus, the project will supply evidence on the type, number, range               and generality of specific visual information-processing                        principles and mechanisms.  Such information will lead to a                     better understanding of vision in humans and aid in the                         implementation of visual pattern recognition in computers.  This                information will also be useful for developing diagnostic and                   remedial procedures for visual-related health problems in humans,               such as computerized visual prostheses or substitutes for the                   blind.",
