 "awd_abstract_narration": "A special laboratory room is being equipped for teaching introductory           and service oriented Computer Science courses that will greatly enhance         efforts to introduce a laboratory component across the lower-divisional         curricula.  Interacting with the students in the laboratory, the                instructor observes and assists students in the entire programming              process from design through implementation and debugging.  The                  microcomputer-based laboratory, linked by a Local Area Network, permits         students to gain a better appreciation of the often non-linear nature           of program development from conception to design to working program             through an iterative process that is difficult to impart in                     traditional classroom settings.
