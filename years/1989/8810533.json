 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, researchers in the atmospheric sciences                     have had great needs in the area of computational support.                      This is due to the emphasis in the science on observations                      (hence, the need to manipulate and display large quantities of                  data) and the requirement for solutions to non-linear partial                   differential equations which can only be solved numerically                     with the aid of high speed computers.  Many of the needs of                     atmospheric scientists can be satisfied by large centralized                    computer facilities (e.g. the National Center for Atmospheric                   Research Scientific Computing Division; National Science                        Foundation Sponsored supercomputer centers), but it has long                    been demonstrated that on-site access to mid-range computers                    with good computational and graphical capabilities can                          substantially enhance education and research productivity.                                                                                                           In conjunction with cost sharing by Purdue University,                     this award will assist in the purchase of a mid-range                           departmental computer which will directly support educational                   activities and the research of seven faculty members who are                    either currently supported by the Foundation or have pending                    proposals.",
