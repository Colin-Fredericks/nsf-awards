 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental mechanisms involved in the resuspension and                     deagglomeration of particles on a surface when other particles                  bombard the surface will be studied.  Experiments will be made                  with monodispense, spherical particles and with agglomerates of                 these particles, as well as with polydisperse, nonspherical                     particles.  Controlled parameters include size, particle shape,                 and surface material.  Particle size distributions before and                   after impact will be measured with optical counters.  The number                and location of particles remaining on the impaction surface will               be measured by scanning electron microscopy via automatic image                 analysis and fluorescent tracers.  Thus, the elementary processes               in particle collisions will be identified and parametized.                                                                                                      Resuspension and deagglomeration are among the least understood                 but most important aerosol phenomena.  The production of dust                   during the process of soil erosion is not well understood; the                  resuspension of radioactive or toxic chemicals from soil has                    resisted major efforts at modelling. Dust from coal and ore piles               and dust generated during the handling of powdered materials are                other important problems affected by this work.  The accuracy of                sampling devices used to measure aerosols will also be improved                 by results of this work.  The basic understanding provided by                   this project will advance the theory and control of these and                   other important engineering problems.",
