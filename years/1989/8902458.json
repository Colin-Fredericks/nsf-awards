 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Carey will continue his investigation of index                   invariants for operator ranges, a far-reaching extension of the                 classical index theory for Fredholm operators. He will also                     pursue a project in multivariable spectral theory having to do                  with the coherent sheaf associated with the Koszul complex of a                 commuting n-tuple of operators. This sheaf, after it has been                   filtered through the algebraic topology of the complement of the                essential spectrum of the n-tuple, yields an invariant whose                    properties Professor Carey will study.                                               This is mathematical research in the theory of operators on                Hilbert space. Operators may be thought of as enriched numbers,                 obeying the same laws of arithmetic as ordinary numbers with two                notable exceptions: multiplication of operators depends upon the                order in which the factors are taken, and not every non-zero                    operator has an inverse. For finite-dimensional operators, i.e.                 square matrices of numbers, these phenomena account for the                     richness of the subject of linear algebra. In the infinite-                     dimensional setting of Hilbert space, there is furthermore the                  phenomenon of non-zero index, of operators obeying the laws of                  arithmetic for numbers except for error terms that are small in                 an appropriate sense and that contain important information about               whatever situation gave rise to the operators. Index theory in                  this sense is the underlying theme of Professor Carey's project.",
