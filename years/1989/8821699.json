 "awd_abstract_narration": "Testosterone is one  of the three major female steroid hormones                 (along with estrogen and progesteron).  Testosterone is important               in female reproductive function for its effects on both                         folliculogenesis and sexual behavior.  Yet, despite                             demonstratations that testosterone levels change under a number                 of differenct ecological conditions, testosterone has not                       received much attention in studies of reproductive ecology.                                                                                                     Assays of salivary testosterone offer several advantages,                       including non-invasive collections techniques and a measure of                  the non-bound fraction of the hormone levels is an appropriate                  means for analyzing ovarian function.  Daily salivary samples                   will be collected for a single menstrual cycle from Boston women                between the ages of 20 and 40.  All samples will be assayed for                 testosterone, and for estradial which will be used to align the                 cycles.                                                                                                                                                         The results of the research will further our understanding of                   gonadal function in women.  The data will not only demonstrate                  the use of salivary assays of testosterone as an indictor of                    ovarian function, but may have implications for changes in sexual               behavior, such as coital frequency.  This will be the first step                towards incorporating the measurement of salivary testosterone                  into field studies of reproductive behavior and ecology.",
