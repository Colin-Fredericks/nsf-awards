 "awd_abstract_narration": "A relatively new area of research in information theory                    concerns coding and information capacity concepts for storage                   systems. As new high.density recording media are developed ;                    e.g., optical and magneto.optical techniques, there is need for                 mathematical models for a variety of storage systems in order                   that maximum efficiency and reliability can be attained. This                   project is concerned with the development of these models as well               as the development of good codes for efficient storage. The                     implementation and complexity aspects of the codes are examined                 and the information storage capacities of the various models are                determined. The models include \"Write.once memories\" (WOM),                     \"Write.unidirectional memories\" (WUM), and their unification and                generalization, \"Write.efficient memories\" (WEM).",
