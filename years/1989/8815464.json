 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in astronomy between             Dr. Gibor Basri, University of California at Berkeley, and Dr.                  Claude Bertout, Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris, France.  The                 objective of the project is the investigation of the physical                   properties of T Tauri disks and winds.  The  T Tauri evolutionary               stage represents the first time during a young star's evolution                 that its surface can be directly observed.  At this time the                    observed spectrum is somewhat abnormal, showing a number and                    variety of emission lines, and continuum excess in the infrared and             ultraviolet.  These spectral peculiarities have eluded a unified                explanation, though many theories have been proposed.  Current work             by the investigators has shown that the origin of these anomalies               can be understood if these young stars are still surrounded by flat             equatorial disks of gas and dust (out of which planets could                    form).  There is evidence that material is continuing to flow                   through these disks and onto the stars.  The systems are also                   ejecting a considerable amount of material in bipolar flows.                                                                                                    In this joint project, the investigators propose to develop and                 expand this understanding of new stars through a collaboration                  involving both coordinated observations and theoretical                         development.  They will study both the disks and the winds from                 young solar-like stars, which should shed light on conditions in                our own early solar system and eventually on the prevalence of                  planetary systems in the galaxy.  This project will benefit from                the large set of high dispersion echelle spectra collected by Dr.               Basri, as well the theoretical expertise of Dr. Bertout.",
