 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the New Deal through the 1970s, levels of party voting and of              party loyalty had declined among members of the House of                        Representatives.  Since the 1970s, however, there has been a sharp              resurgence of partisanship, and previous explanations do not anticipate         or account for this recent change.  The objective of this research is           to develop a theory of party voting which explains both partisan                decline and resurgence, and to determine whether the theory's                   predictions are consistent with available evidence on politics in the           House.                                                                                                                                                          The development of the theory begins with a focus on the factors that           influence the choice of a single member on a single vote.  It builds            from there to a consideration of the way choices of individuals                 eventually are combined into the aggregate of all votes on all issues           within an entire Congress.  The relevant factors include influences on          members' preferences, institutional processes that shape alternatives           for choice, and outside or inside forces that vary the mix of issues            over time.  Based on this analysis, it is argued that the variations in         partisan voting depend on changes in electoral influences (particularly         realignment of voters at the district level and changes in the kinds            of candidates recruited by the two parties), on changes in the agenda           of issues considered by the House, and on alterations of the                    institutional arrangements that govern how bills are shaped and how             they are considered on the House floor.                                                                                                                         In marshalling data to determine whether the theoretical arguments are          supported, the study of electoral influences will include analysis over         time of changes in the issue preferences of voters for House candidates         of the two parties, and collection of information on the political              positions of candidates competing for House nominations within each             party over the last 36 years.  The consideration of the changing issue          agenda will include analysis of all roll calls on the House floor from          1953 through 1988, focusing on the degree to which voting patterns              remain consistent within issue categories.  Finally, the analysis of            institutional arrangements will trace the impact of decreases in the            power of committee chairmen and the adoption of new rules to strengthen         party leaders on the kinds of alternatives members are faced with on            the floor.  This segment of the study also considers the influence of           particular party leaders and particular presidents on the kinds of              choices members confronted.                                                                                                                                     If the theory of congressional partisanship is supported by the                 evidence, it will require a significant revision in the current                 conceptions of political conflict in the House, which regard political          parties to be weak and member ties to them of little importance.  The           analysis will also show how greater partisanship can be exhibited by            elected representatives even when traditional ties between parties and          voters are growing progressively weaker.  Finally, the theory will              enable a specification of the conditions which are likely to lead to            greater or lesser partisanship in political institutions in the future.",
