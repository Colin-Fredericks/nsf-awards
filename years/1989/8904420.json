 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mid-cenozoic ignimbrites of western Mexico constitute the                   largest rhyolite province in the world, and definitive evidence                 regarding their genesis must be recorded in the deep crust and                  upper mantle beneath the region.  In previous petrogenetic                      studies of voluminous ignimbrites from Mexico and elsewhere, it                 has not been possible to quantitatively evaluate the relative                   contributions of crustal and mantle components for the following                reasons: (1) The deep crust is heterogeneous, and almost                        invariable, its age and composition beneath the volcanic field                  can only be inferred.  (2) The sub-crustal isotopic compositions                of continental arc basaltic magma  are rarely known because any                 magma that passed through the continental crust may acquire a                   crustal isotopic signature.  The La Olivina area of chihuahua,                  Mexico provides an unusual opportunity to elucidate the origin                  and evolution of calc-alkalic rocks, including voluminous                       ignimbrites, by drawing on data from crustal and mantle                         xenoliths.                                                                      The primary goals of this research are as follows: (1) Determine                the igneous and metamorphic history of the deep crust beneath                   central chihuahua by dating zircons from granulite facies                       xenoliths using the SHRIMP ion microprobe and conventional                      techniques.  The SHRIMP analyses will be made by Roberta Rudnick                at the Australian National University.  (2) Completely                          characterize the deep crustal xenoliths and volcanic rocks from                 the region by major element, isotopic (Sr, Nd, Pb), and                         geothermic-geobaric studies.  (3) Quantitatively test                           petrogenetic models relating the volcanic rocks to specific deep                crustal lithologies.  These models are uniquely constrained by                  data from mantle metapyroxenite xenoliths that record the                       isotopic compositions of \"uncontaminated\" continental arc                       basaltic magmas.  The final result of this research should be an                exceptional documentation of the impact of voluminous silicic                   magmatism on the deep crust.",
