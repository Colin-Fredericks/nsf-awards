 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this investigation is to continue work on the                    development of effective computational methods for nonlinear, parameter         dependent equations.  The equations involve a state variable, which is          usually infinite dimensional, a finite dimensional parameter vector.            Under appropriate conditions, the solutions of the state space and the          parameter space.                                                                                                                                                Problems of this type arise in numerous, practically important                  equilibrium studies in physics and engineering.  For example, the               equation may describe the equilibrium positions of a mechanical                 structure, in which case the state variable characterizes, say, the             deformations while the parameter vector incorporates information about          the load points, load directions, material properties, geometrical              data, etc.  In this, as in most applications of this type, interest             centers rarely on the computation of a few solutions for fixed choices          of the parameters, but instead one has to address, what is often                called, the sensitivity problem.  This concerns the question of the             change of the solutions under variation of the parameters.  In                  particular, one needs to determine those values of the parameters where         the character of the solution changes, for instance, where stability is         lost.  Thus, in essence, the sensitivity problem requires a                     computational study of the shape and properties of the solution                 manifold.                                                                                                                                                       The assumption of the existence of the solution manifold presumes that          the problem has been suitably unfolded.  This turns out to be a very            natural assumption in most applications and to have considerable                advantages for the numerical solution of parametrized equation.  Up to          now, the numerical analysis literature has paid little attention to             this differential-geometric aspect of multi-parameter nonlinear                 equations.  But a consistent utilization of differential-geometric              concepts and results can provide a powerful tool in the development of          effective computational methods for a unified analysis of the solution          properties of the parametrized equation.",
