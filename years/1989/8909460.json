 "awd_abstract_narration": "Snow covers many parts of the earth's surface for a                        portion of the year; and in areas that experience seasonal                      snowmelt, the runoff plays an important role in recharging                      surface water and groundwater systems.  Snowpacks, however,                     accumulate manmade and \"natural\" pollutants.  This accumulated                  material will enter aquatic systems during spring melt.  The                    chemical load does not enter the aquatic systems gradually; a                   substantial fraction of the chemical load is released from the                  base of the pack in the initial melt period.  The result is                     some watersheds receive significant amounts of acids, trace                     metals, and other contaminants in a short period of time.  It                   is expected that the results of this work will contribute to                    the understanding of snowpack processes, in particular the                      scavenging of gases and the formation of acidity in the                         snowpack.                                                                            The purpose of the proposed work is to gain insight into                   the physical and chemical processes involved in the formation                   of acidity in snowpack.  The experiments are designed to                        investigate the incorporation of sulfur dioxide and the                         oxidation/reduction reactions that can contribute to the                        acidity of snow.   The amount of gas sorbed on the snow as a                    function of time and the oxidation products in the snow will be                 modeled to gain insight as to the chemical and physical                         mechanisms.",
