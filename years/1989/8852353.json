 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to meet the needs of new                               interdisciplinary approaches at the interface of physical,                      bio-, and inorganic chemistry.  The proposed experiments are                    designed specifically to introduce the techniques and style of                  modern chemical research as it is applied to molecules of                       proven biological relevance.  For this purpose model systems                    have been chosen and include porphyrin and metalloporphyrin                     compounds which have been intensively studied and have rich                     chemical properties in liganding, catalysis, electron transfer,                 and oxygen transport.  Further, the well documented and                         rationalized spectroscopic properties of these compounds make                   them ideal for laboratory instruction.  Students will use                       several techniques including absorption, fluorescence, IR, NMR                  and ESR spectroscopy to characterize the structure, binding,                    and redox properties of these molecules.                                                                                                                        This ILI award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation                        Program will help the Department of Chemistry at New York                       University to acquire UV/VIS and IR spectrometers, fluorescence                 spectrometer accessories, and four PC's for data acquisition,                   digitization and manipulation.  Upgrades for a fluorimeter, NMR                 and ESR instruments are also supported by the award.  The                       instrumentation will be used to enhance undergraduate                           laboratory instruction and impact on chemistry curriculum                       development.",
