Given the increasing population of homebased                      workers, a future market demand for such homes is likely.  In                   order to undertake a research study of the development and design               of such homes nationwide, certain preliminary activities need to                be developed and refined in a planning study:  locating cases                   (which is currently an on-going activity), gathering information                of such cases from documents and site visits, and developing a                  coding instrument for analysis of such sites on characteristics                 of architectural design and layout, materials, construction                     techniques, sociodemographics, financial arrangements, codes and                ordinances, insurance factors, etc.",
