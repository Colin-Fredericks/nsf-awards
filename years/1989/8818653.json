 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanism controlling vortex-induced motion of marine cables                and   tethers is of great interest to those who work in the                     ocean.  In almost   all marine applications, the fluid flow,                    which induces themotion, is   sheared due to local current                      variations or is effectively sheared due to  curvature of the                   cable.  Shear flow causes the amplitude response of a   tow cable               to be modulated by a traveling wave.                                                                                                                            The basic mechanism affecting the formation ofamplitude-modulated               traveling waves in a tether subjected to a shear flow will be                   investigated.  Experiments will be performed on a cylinder that                 is forced to oscillate with a modulated motion, measuring                       simultaneously the motion of the cylinder, the forces acting on                 the cylinder, and the amplitude and phase of the fluid forces.                  One application of such information is in the prediction of the                 forces on long cables.  The experimental will include                           numerical calculations of two-dimensional flow around a cylinder                that is  forced to oscillate with amplitude-modulated motion.                   The coupling of   experimental measurements and numerical                       calculations should lead to an   improved understanding of how                  shear flows and slender cylinders interact.",
