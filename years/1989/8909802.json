 "awd_abstract_narration": "Corrugated thin-film waveguides have played a significant role in the           development of optical devices, including distributed feedback lasers           (DFB), waveguide couplers, and optical filters.  The objective of the           proposed research is to develop and test a new design technique for             aperiodic corrugated waveguide (CWG) filters.  This technique will be           based on second order Fourier synthesis methods, which have been                recently applied to the design of multilayer dielectric stacks.  Using          these methods, aperiodic CWG filters will be designed to satisfy                specified spectral transmittance and reflectance characteristics.  The          devices will be subsequently fabricated in glass waveguides, and their          characteristics will be measured using a tunable dye laser.  The                fabrication of some of the proposed filters is unique in that attempts          will be made to vary both the corrugation depth and the period along            the guide.                                                                                                                                                      The proposed research will also permit the accuracy of several                  important propagation analysis techniques (for aperiodic structures)            to be experimentally compared.  This comparison will be based on the            measured spectral transmittance of the fabricated devices.",
