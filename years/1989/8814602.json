 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of Analytical and Surface                   Chemistry and in the subfields of molecular spectroscopy and                    separations science. The thrust of this experimental                            program,under the direction of Professor Mary Wirth of the                      University of Delaware, focuses on the applications of                          molecular reorientation measurements to the field of analytical                 chemistry. The overall goal of the research is to determine the                 amount of solute geometry information that can be obtained by                   quantitative measurements of rotational diffusion parameters.                   This goal will be achieved by studying 1) solutes that are very                 similar in structure to one another, e.g. isomers, 2)large                      polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons suspected of changing                         conformation in strong chromatographic solvents, 3)solute                       attachment to micelles and to silica surfaces, and 4)                           solute/solvent systems having poorly understood solvation                       interactions.                                                                                                                                                   The research proposed here will be used to examine the rotation                 of various molecules in different solvents. Lasers will be used                 as probes to measure this rotation as well as the interaction                   of these molecules with the various solvents. Molecules that                    are very similar in structure as well as large organic                          molecules composed of carbon and hydrogen will be used in this                  study. The results of these studies may be used to predict the                  separation of similar molecules in liquid chromatography.",
