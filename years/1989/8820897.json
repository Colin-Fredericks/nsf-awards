 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most interesting and fundamental areas of economic analysis          concerns the provision of public goods.  As a generic term, a \"public           good\" is one which is provided and financed by many people, but can be          used by individuals.  Obvious examples are goods and services provided          by governments to citizens in general.  On a smaller scale the term             can be applied to any situation in which a group, by acting in a                collective fashion, can provide goods and services that the individual          members of the group could not finance themselves.                                                                                                              The pricing of public goods, that is to say the charges levied on the           individual members of the group, is very important.  A difficult                problem is to invoke a pricing policy in which each user of the good            pays a fair share of the cost of providing that good.  Often, because           of asymmetric information about usage, some members of the group pay            more than their share while other members \"ride free\".                                                                                                          The project explores two new research areas and expands our knowledge           of public goods provision within the context of a voluntary                     contribution mechanism.  The first topic examines a \"nested\" public             goods problem in which groups may communicate only if they pay the              organization costs associated with communication.  The second area              involves an experimental inquiry into the properties of public goods            provision in large groups.  Past work has shown that group size,                particularly when endogenously determined,  can significantly affect            the outcome of public goods experiments.                                                                                                                        The project is done in collaboration with Mark Isaac of the University          of Arizona.                                                                     %%%                                                                             One of the most interesting and fundamental areas of economic analysis          concerns the provision of public goods.

This project applies the framework of experimental economics in two             main areas of public good provision to assess the impact of                     information sharing among group members.  In the first part                     communication costs are borne fully by the members.  The second part            of the work studies the affect of group size on the outcome of public           good pricing.",
