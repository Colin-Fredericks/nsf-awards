 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to enable econometric and economic              models to better represent economic behavior and, thus, provide better          answers to questions confronting decision makers in the private and             public sectors.  The project will involve the reformulation of problems         in statistical inference and optimization, inspired and made possible           by recent advances in widely available computational capacity.                  Research methods iterate between the problems that define and motivate          economic analysis and econometrics, computational experiments, and the          development of new analytical tools.  In economic modeling, the                 emphasis is on numerical mapping from decision rules to objective               functions.  Much of this development is in the context of particular            problems, including seasonal adjustment, nonstructural representations          of macroeconomic time series, cointegration models, the solution of             nonlinear or rational expectations models that are generic and                  algorithmic, and can, therefore, be used systematically in studying a           wide range of problems.  This and related research by others over the           next decade will enable economists to address policy problems much more         directly, with emphasis shifting from the constraints of analytical             approaches to a greatly enriched modeling of behavior.",
