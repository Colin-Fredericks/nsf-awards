The series will            look at medicine in transition around the would, examining the complex          forces shaping its future using a multi-disciplinary approach and               illustrating the differences in medicine among different cultures.              Explaining the scientific underpinnings of advances in medicine, the            series will explore how they are challenging our fundamental definitions        of sickness and health, treatment and cure, doctor and patient, life and        death.  Program topics will include Drugs, Surgery, Prevention, Babies,         The Elderly, The Doctor, Learning to Heal, The Hospital, and the Doctor-        Patient Relationship.                                                                                                                                           The series will involve rigorous research of topic areas in                     collaboration with a highly qualified board of scientific advisors.             Companion materials including college and high school curricula and             trade books will extend the series to additional students and to the            general population.  The series should be among the most viewed programs        on the PBS schedule.  NSF support will be leveraged by more than ten            times over in support from other governmental agencies, CPB and PBS, and        corporate sources.//",
