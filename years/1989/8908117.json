 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemosensory functions of taste and smell are particularly                  important for many insects to use for finding appropriate food,                 mates, or sites for egg deposition.  Insects provide relatively                 simple systems for examining the molecular basis for stimulant                  binding to receptors, and how nerve cells code information for                  the brain to control behavioral responses.                                                                                                                      This workshop will exchange information and techniques for                      addressing insect chemosensory mechanisms.  The emphasis is on                  discussion of ideas and experimental analysis of chemoreceptor                  biochemistry, physiology, and coding; and of new techniques,                    including computer processing of data as well as some                           standardization to allow easy communication of information among                investigators who are widely distributed around the world.  This                conference is unique, the first international workshop                          specifically addressed to chemosensory function in insects.                     Because of their relation to plants, insects are very important                 to world ecology and world agriculture.  The increased                          understanding from this workshop, of why insects eat or lay eggs                on some plants but not others, will have substantial impact on                  ecology and insect biology, as well as on chemosensory science.",
