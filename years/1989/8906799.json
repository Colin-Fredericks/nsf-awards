 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central problem addressed by this project is the synthesis of               randomization with geometry.  We propose to study the theoretical as            well as the practical implications of such a synthesis.  A tradition            study of randomization in the context of geometry-as in stochastic              geometry - studies the expected value of various quantities of                  interest, when the geometric elements in question are chosen randomly           from a nice distribution.  Unfortunately, this approach has only a              limited algorithmic applicability, because the distributions actually           found in practice are not always well behaved.  On the other hand, the          approach in this project assumes nothing about the input, and only the          order, in which the elements are chosen, is supposed to be random.              More precisely, this project studies the random evolution of the                configuration as the geometric elements in the given input set are              chosen, and put at their already specified locations, in a random               order.  It turns out that, this approach helps one design algorithms            for geometric problems, which are very efficient, and robust.  A                distinguishing characteristic of these algorithms is that they are              randomized, and incremental:  they proceed by considering the geometric         elements, one at a time, but in a random order.  This project further           develop the underlying theory, and uses it to design efficient                  algorithms for various geometric problems in computational geometry,            graphics, and robot motion planning.
