 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase Two of Operation Physics continues this national project to               improve the teaching and learning of basic physics concepts in the upper        elementary and middle school grades.  Thirty-six three-member leadership        teams, geographically distributed throughout the United States will             participate in an intensive activity-oriented three-week training               program held at San Diego State University.  This team, consisting of a         teacher, a supervisor or administrator and a college/university person          from the local region, will focus on the physics content typically              identified for inclusion in the K-8 curriculum, current methods and             materials appropriate for teaching physics to elementary and middle             school children, recent research related to learning theory and teaching        practice using especially designed workshop kits developed during the           first phase of the project.  The teams will also receive training and           assistance in using these kits to plan and conduct a required number of         inservice workshops in their own area.                                                                                                                          The Operation Physics teams will be assisted in their dissemination             efforts through the services of the Education Division of the American          Institute of Physics and the Operation Physics State Facilitators.              These State Facilitators will coordinate the implementation and                 dissemination of the Operation Physics programs in the state.                                                                                                   The cost-sharing for this project represents a significant part                 of the total cost.  Contributions from the school districts, San                Diego State University, and AIP represent an amount equal to 49%                of the NSF request.                                                              //",
