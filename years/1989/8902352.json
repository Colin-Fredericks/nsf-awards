 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important and inspiring viewpoint in the representation                 theory of semisimple Lie groups has been the attempt of realizing               representations as certain geometric objects, typically as the                  space of global sections of certain vector bundles on various                   homogeneous spaces of the underlying group. The project of                      Professors Zierau and Chang will investigate further this                       interplay between geometric operations and the corresponding                    representation-theoretic implications. Chang will study discrete                series for semisimple symmetric spaces using D-module techniques,               while Zierau will study the space of harmonic forms on Kahler                   semisimple symmetric spaces in order to unitarize certain                       representations.                                                                     This project has to do with the representation theory of Lie               groups, which bear the name of the Norwegian mathematician Sophus               Lie. These fundamental mathematical objects arise naturally in                  several ways. One basic example of a Lie group is the group of                  rotations of a sphere, where the group operation consists of                    following one motion by another. Detailed information concerning                this group is very helpful in solving mathematical or physical                  problems in which spherical symmetry is present. Other groups of                motions capture other kinds of symmetry. A more algebraic (as                   opposed to geometric) source of examples of Lie groups comes from               the multiplication of matrices. The group of all invertible real                (or complex) matrices of a given size is a Lie group, as is just                about any subgroup thereof that can be described in a natural                   manner. It is desirable to be able to go back and forth between                 the geometric and algebraic points of view, for instance to                     consider the numerous ways in which the rotation group of the                   sphere can be realized as a group of invertible matrices. This,                 roughly, is representation theory. It is useful because facts                   about the representations of a given group tend to store a lot of               information very economically. The research of Professors Zierau                and Chang will concentrate on ways to build representations of a                group by letting it act on certain kinds of geometric structures.",
