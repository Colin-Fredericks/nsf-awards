 "awd_abstract_narration": "An analysis of the built environment that incorporates an examination           of economy and society has been heralded as a key to developing a more          fundamental understanding of society and space, yet few studies have            attempted such a synthesis.  This project will comparatively study              Boston and New York City, documenting the changing locational patterns          of each city's retail and elite residential districts and analyzing a           number of case studies that will serve to link landscape features with          their social and economic contexts.  The research will address                  questions such as the extent to which a city's position in an urban             hierarchy is related to that city's built form; the degree to which a           city's economic elite shape the urban landscape; and how the city's             social structure is expressed in its landscape.                                                                                                                 By providing a detailed study of the links between economy, social              structure, and built form in a historical context, and by examining             both commercial and residential structures, this project will make a            major empirical and theoretical contribution to our understanding of            the general relationship between landscape, society, and economy.  It           will advance the frontier of a new cultural geography by placing                landscape in a broader societal context in order to derive explanation          rather than description, and it will facilitate the development of new          directions in historical urban geography.  It will add a spatial                dimension absent from the work of urban historians and urban                    architectural historians, a dimension essential to explaining the               evolving urban morphology of American cities.",
