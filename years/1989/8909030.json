 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) is essential for development and                      survival of sympathetic and sensory neurons in the peripheral                   nervous system.  In PC12 cells, NGF stimulates the                              differentiation of the cells into sympathetic-like neurons.                     Previous studies have shown that NGF stimulates the hydrolysis of               phosphoinositides in PC12 cells by a phospholipase C-mediated                   reaction.  This hydrolytic reaction occurs with a time course and               dose-dependence that is consistent with the hypothesis that                     phosphoinositides may play a role in the mechanism of action of                 NGF.  To analyze the role of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the                 actions of NGF, the research plan is divided into three sections:               1) The effect of NGF on the formation of inositol phosphates, and               DAG, and release of arachidonic acid will be examined to                        determine the identity of potential second messengers in the                    action of NGF.  2) To explore the role of phosphoinositide                      hydrolysis in differentiation of PC12 cells, the metabolism of                  phosphoinositides induced by fibroblast growth factor, another                  differentiating factor, or by NGF in NGF-primed cells will be                   examined.  3) The phosphoinositide metabolism in adrenal                        chromaffin cells from neonatal rats will be assessed to determine               whether NGF-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis occurs in NGF-                  sensitive nonneoplastic cells.",
