 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major problems in computer understanding of natural                  language is the ever present ambiguity.  Words have multiple                    meanings, sentences can be grammatically parsed several different               ways, noun phrases can refer to several possible objects in the                 text, etc.  Typically it is not possible to make the correct                    choice because the others are logically impossible.  Rather the                 correct choice is simply more plausible, or probable, than the                  others.  This investigator will integrate the use of probability                theory into language comprehension in order to better solve                     these and related problems (like plan recognition deciding on a                 story character's plans on the basis of the character's actions).               In particular, the proposed system will use the various clues                   from the sentence as well as the context, to build up a Bayes                   network representation of the probability distribution.  As in                  current work by this research the probabilities will be used to                 guide processing and eventually to completely clip less likely                  alternatives.",
