These collaborators intend to                   examine the design decision making process and structure of design              knowledge used in architectural offices or firms both in the United             States and in Turkey.  There is an professional concern                         internationally among architects about their profession and its                 educational processes.  This comparative study of skill of                      architects and the implications for architectural education will                have its main focus on the structure of the information network                 between members of design teams, the content of this information,               what are the knowledge areas used by architects in their collective             design efforts and the integration of these knowledge or                        information areas with each other and with whole design effort.                                                                                                 Scope:  The study method proposed will be undertaken in three major             stages.  The first will build a theoretical model for design                    decision making in architectural office settings.  In the second                stage different office settings will be selected for data                       collection concerning structure and the content of the information              flow between design team members at sites in the U.S. and in                    Turkey.  The last stage  will be to develop a descriptive model of              design decision making in architectural office settings.  The goals             of this study are:                                                                  o    to advance the exchange of knowledge between the U.S. and              Turkey                                                                              o    to advance the exchange of knowledge between the two                            collaborating universities                                                 o    to contribute to the development of a theory of the                             expertise of architects and to describe the design                              decision making process in architectural office settings,                       and                                                                        o    to increase understanding of the collective design process                      for potential contributions to education and practice in                        architecture                                                           This proposal does meet the objectives of the Science in Developing             Countries of advancing the international exchange of scientific                 knowledge and of contributing to the enhancement of science in the              developing country.",
