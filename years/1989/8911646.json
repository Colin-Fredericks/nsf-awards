 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethics and Values Studies supports research and educational                     projects on ethical and value aspects of the interaction between                science, technology and society.  Projects examine the social                   values and mutual obligations and responsibilities that arise in                these interactions.  This project will produce a handbook and                   supplementary materials that will provide social science faculty                and students with the practical knowledge required to plan the                  ethical aspects of social and behavioral research, and to obtain                Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.  These materials will                bridge the gap between what is required by federal regulations of               human research and what methods texts cover. In particular, the                 results will provide education and training that new researchers                and new IRB members need in order to be effective and meet                      ethical requirements.  The project involves review and revision                 of a currently drafted handbook.  A needs assessment and indepth                evaluation by IRB members, social science faculty and their                     students will ensure that the final product is acceptable and                   useful to all three constituencies.  The project will obtain                    expert and peer review before the materials are published.                      This study comes from a very well-qualified researcher who plans                to use appropriate undergraduate research assistance.  The                      review and dissemination plans are appropriate; institutional                   support is very good.  The project has important implications for               the assurance of quality social science research that meets                     ethical requirements; also, it provides assistance in future                    curriculum development.  Support is recommended.",
