 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project titled \"The Solvent Cage Effect in Organometallic                  Chemistry\" will be carried out by Thomas W. Koenig and David R.                 Tyler of the University of Oregon and is funded within the                      Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program.                   The research will examine the fate of organometallic radicals                   in a solvent cage. The results of this study are expected to                    lead to enhanced knowledge of the reactivity of organometallic                  radicals and thus a greater understanding of the mechanism by                   which many organometallic reactions occur.                                                                                                                      Studies will be carried out on cage radical pairs that are                      formed both reversibly and irreversibly from selected precursor                 molecules. The reversibly formed cage pairs will be generated                   by thermolysis of metal-metal or metal-carbon bonds, such as in                 octacarbonylbis(triphenylphosphine)dimanganese(0). The                          irreversibly formed cage pairs will be generated by photolysis                  of dimetallic complexes which eliminate an intervening atom or                  molecule, such as bis(tetracarbonylcobalt)mercury in which the                  mercury atom is eliminated as the small spacer molecule between                 the cobalt groups. Specific goals in addition to the increased                  understanding of radical reactivity are: determining                            substantially improved values of bond dissociation energies for                 organometallic complexes; determining the cage efficiency,                      i.e., cage combination compared to cage escape of radicals; and                 assessing the effects of steric size and mass of the radical as                 well as the viscosity of the solvent on the cage efficiency.",
