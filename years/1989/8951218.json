 "awd_abstract_narration": "In keeping with the \"learn by doing\" philosophy at Cal Poly,               Pomona, the Chemistry Department has developed a strong set of                  upper division laboratory courses which allow the students access               to a variety of state-of-the-art instruments.  One clear                        deficiency in this program is the lack of an NMR comparable to                  one which is used by the students in post-graduate or industrial                positions.  This is a rapidly expanding area for all of                         chemistry-organic, organometallic, inorganic, physical and                      biochemistry.  To remedy the deficiency a 200Mhz FT-NMR was                     purchased.  Experiments have been designed to use this NMR in                   upper division courses.  The majority of these experiments                      utilize the multinuclear capability of the FT-NMR.  The most                    important use for the new spectrometer is in selected upper                     division chemistry courses and in the required senior project                   research courses.  We believe that students can only begin to                   appreciate the role of NMR in problem solving through first hand                experience in the measurement of spectra.                                                                                                                            The institution is matching NSF grant with an equal amount                 of funds.",
