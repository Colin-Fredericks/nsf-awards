 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to investigate an efficient static             state estimator for very large power systems.  The proposed estimator           consists of performing a two-level calculation:  in the lower (first)           hierarchical level, a conventional state estimation is performed                simultaneously for all subsystems; these local estimations are then             coordinated at the upper level.  The approach exploites the physical            properties of power systems and formulates the local state estimation           problem as two linear programming sub-problems which would be                   sequentially solved by a proposed method.  It also suggests                     investigating a form of the decomposition principle of Dantzig and              Wolf to reduce the size of the problem.  Standard IEEE and other                existing power systems will be used for testing and comparison                  purposes.  The proposed research suggests innovative techniques to              solve the problem of state estimation on large scale power systems.             It will certainly increase the understanding of the properties of               linear programming state estimators and would suggest remedies to the           problems which they might have.  It is also expected to result in a             new approach for decomposing the state estimation problem that is               suitable for application with linear programming state estimators.",
