 "awd_abstract_narration": "The body of literature relating to the population-                         community interface in marine soft-bottom systems falls roughly                 into two classes.  The more common view has been to approach                    the interface from above, by studying patterns of community                     structure and function and relate these patterns to theories                    concerning the interactions between populations and how species                 life histories relate to the nature of the environment.  The                    other class of studies approaches the population-community                      interface from below by examining details of selected                           populations of organisms and relating theses patterns to                        theories concerning the interactions between populations and                    the nature of the environment.  This research provides a direct                 assessment of the contribution that population-level processes,                 including life history dependent demographic dynamics, make to                  key processes controlling infaunal community structure. More                    generally, it will add significantly to our understanding of                    infaunal demographic dynamics and how they vary with habitat                    conditions. In addition it will provide population-level                        information with bearing on other areas of benthic research                     such as secondary production, foraging tactics and deposit                      feeding.",
