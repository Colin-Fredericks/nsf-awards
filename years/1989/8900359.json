 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to initiate a summer undergraduate                    research experience for 8 students in physiological ecology at                  Alma College and is intended to provide \"practicum\" in scientific               research.  The goal is to better prepare undergraduate students                 for graduate programs by enabling students to bridge the gap from               student to practitioner of science.  Special attention will be                  given to searching and reading literature, framing testable                     hypotheses, devising experimental protocols, developing technique               and expertise with instrumentation, analyzing data, and writing a               paper.  Weekly meetings to discuss progress and problems and                    monthly seminars (by students and visiting scientists) will                     underscore the notion of communication among scientists.                        Students will work on individual projects with faculty mentors.                 The three proposed projects include: desert adaptations, body                   temperature regulation, biophysics, and histology of desert                     reptiles; plant disease and epidemiology involving \"ash-yellows\",               a bacterial disease of significant ecological and economic                      importance; and symbiotic relations between a wood-boring beetle                and a fungus living in infested maple saplings.  Each project has               laboratory and field components and each project will invite a                  prominent researcher to present a seminar and consult with                      students.",
