The program is designed to                      introduce gifted undergraduates into on-going, productive Cell                  and Molecular Biology research programs.  Participants will be                  actively recruited nationwide, but emphasis will be given to                    undergraduates who would not otherwise have the opportunity for                 original research, especially women and minority students.                      Minority students will be encouraged to apply by visiting Texas                 colleges and universities with high minority enrollments, and at                least 40% of the positions will be allocated to minority                        students.  Participants will have access to well-funded and                     equipped labs in which the research covers both prokaryotic and                 eucaryotic systems and deals with DNA replication, transcripion,                development processes, immunobiology, oncogenesis, protein                      transport, and membrane function.  Participants will work                       individually with faculty mentors but have access to all faculty                through seminars and informal discussions.  The three women (one                hispanic) on the Graduate faculty will serve as role models to                  encourage the female and minority participants.  Follow-up                      procedures will promote interest in research careers.  UT Austin                has already made a strong commitment to this program, including                 organizing a Pilot Program in 1988 and funding recruiting trips                 plus room, board, and fees for minority participants.",
