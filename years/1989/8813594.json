 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sulfur is one of the major elements which is essential for                 metabolic processes in all forms of biological organisms on our                 planet.  Sulfur in its various chemical forms continuously                      cycled between the biosphere and other terrestrial reservoirs,                  such as the hydrosphere and the atmosphere.  Natural sources                    emit a considerable number of organic and inorganic sulfur                      compounds into the atmosphere.  These sulfur compounds are                      chemically transformed under atmospheric conditions into other                  sulfur species which are eventually removed from the atmosphere                 and led back to the biosphere and other reservoirs via dry and                  wet deposition processes.  This cycle counteracts a build-up of                 toxic levels of sulfur in the atmosphere and, at the same time,                 supplies the biosphere with critical life-supporting sulfur                     compounds.  Although emissions of man-made sulfur compounds are                 reasonably well documented, a major uncertainty in assessing                    the anthropogenic impact to the environment (such as acid rain                  and visibility) is the lack of understanding of the natural                     sulfur cycle.  This project will develop measurement techniques                 for the major sulfur compounds in the natural atmosphere,                       including those in aerosol particles and cloudwater.  The                       program is aimed at elucidating the relative importance of                      various natural environments with respect to the global                         atmospheric sulfur cycle.  The sampling and analytical                          techniques developed in this work will be critically examined                   through intercomparisions.  The result of this project should                   aid in laying a foundation for future comprehensive field                       experiments dedicated to a quantitative determination of the                    major chemical pathways of sulfur in the atmosphere and to an                   accurate assessment of natural verses anthropogenic                             contributions to the global atmospheric sulfur budget.",
