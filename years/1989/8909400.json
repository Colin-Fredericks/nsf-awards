 "awd_abstract_narration": "This objective of this project is to determine the effects                      of chemical addition and flocculation on the performance of                     deep-bed granular media filters that are utilized to remove                     particles from dilute aqueous suspensions.  The effects of                      variations in the duration and intensity of mixing in                           flocculation and of coagulant type and dose on particle                         deposition and head loss development will be studied using                      a continuous flow direct filtration apparatus.  The study                       is focussed on the effects of changes in particle size                          distributions on filtration, comparison of effects between                      coagulants, and sensitivity to changes in chemical                              conditions.  Measurements of electrophoretic mobility,                          particle size distributions, light scattering phenomena,                        particle removal, and head loss development will be made.                                                                                                       The removal of particles from water is a primary objective                      of engineered treatment processes because many waterborne                       pollutants of concern to human health are particles or are                      associated with particles.  These pollutants include                            viruses, bacteria, Giardia lamblia cysts, adsorbed heavy                        metals and synthetic organics.  Recent federal regulations                      that stipulate removal requirements for microbiological                         particles and a more stringent turbidity standard will                          result in a requirement of new or improved filtration                           facilities for many water supplies.  An improved                                mechanistic understanding of the effects of chemical                            addition and flocculation on filtration performance should                      lead to more rational and cost-optimal designs for new                          facilities and better operation and control of existing                         filtration systems.",
