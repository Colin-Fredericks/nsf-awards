 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main focus of the research is the development, and use                 in physics measurements, of a particle detector system for the                  DO proton-antiproton intersection region of the highest energy                  collider in the world located at Fermilab.  This detector                       system, called the DO detector, is expected to be one of the                    most important instruments for elementary particle physics                      research during the next decade.  This work is a large                          collaborative effort amongst more than 20 institutions in which                 Willis, et al. play a significant role.  The DO detector will                   be used to:  measure the properties of the \"weak bosons\",                       carriers of the weak nuclear force; study the properties of the                 strong nuclear force (quantum chromodynamics); and search for                   yet undiscovered phenomena.  Willis, et al. will also complete                  the analysis and publication of their work on Fermilab                          experiment E653, which measures the properties of short lived                   particles (e.g., charmed and beauty mesons) produced in nuclear                 emulsion.  The field of research is that of experimental                        elementary particle physics.  This research studies the basic                   building blocks of matter (e.g., electrons, positrons, quarks,                  and weak bosons) at very high energies.  The experiments use                    accelerators and colliders which provide the highest energy                     particles made in the laboratory.  The data is collected and                    analyzed using highly complex and sophisticated apparatus and                   techniques.",
