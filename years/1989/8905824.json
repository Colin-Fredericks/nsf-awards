 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two families of new polymers will be prepared:  a)                              methylenealkoxy-substituted poly(isocyanates) and the unknown                   poly(isocyanic acid) and b) methylenealkoxy-substituted                         poly(carbodiimides) and the unknown poly(carbodiimide)                          \u0131poly)cyanamide) or poly (guanidine)! as well as copolymers                     within each family.  Because of the highly polar repeat unit,                   these polymers are expected, upon polarizing in high electric                   fields, to produce ferroelectric solids akin to poly (vinylidene                fluoride).  Ferroelectric solidss have applications as                          peizoelectrics (e.g., transducers such as sensitive microphones)                and nonlinear optics (mode converters, modulators, Y-branch                     interferometers, and directional couplers).  Other salient                      features of this research are:  1.) Poly(isocyanic acid), due to                its high degree of hydrogen bonding and the strength of the amide               linkage, is expected to be superior to any known synthetic fiber                in strength, strength on compression, toughness and oxidative                   stability.  2.) The substituted poly(carbodiimides) will be                     prepared in chiral form and depolymerized.  Thus, a novel                       carbodiimide optical resolution procedure based on thermal                      depolymerization of a chiral poly(carbodiimide will be prepared.                The chiral carbodiimide is a fundamentally new functional group.                3.)  The parent, unsubstituted poly(carbodiimide), will become                  conjugated at intermediate protonation levels and will be                       converted to a highly conducting form upon further protonation                  via a new concept of protonative positive soliton generation.",
