 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an observational study of the formation, evolution, and         dissipation of mesoscale cyclones along the Pacific coastline of the            antarctic continent.  It will be carried out jointly with a                     complementary effort at Ohio State University.                                                                                                                  It has been known for some time that the higher southern hemisphere             latitudes are regions of decay for synoptic-scale cyclones.  It has             however only recently been found that smaller mesoscale cyclones can            frequently occur over the sea ice and the adjacent coastal areas of             Antarctica, and significantly affect the coastal climate.                                                                                                       This study will include both climatological and dynamical aspects of            mesoscale cyclones and will be based on the digital satellite data              recorded at McMurdo and Palmer Stations and on the extensive array of           automatic weather stations and drifting sea ice buoys in the Ross Sea           area.  Specific tasks to be undertaken include the definition of                characteristic satellite signatures associated with various stages, the         identification of development and dissipation regions, and preferred            tracks from the Ross Sea eastward to the Antarctic peninsula.  Existing         upper air soundings and satellite-derived atmospheric profile data will         be used to investigate mesoscale dynamics in the southwestern Ross Sea,         one of the active formation regions.  The quantified results will be            applied to the problem of forecasting mesocyclones affecting the western        side of the Antarctic Peninsula and southern South America.",
