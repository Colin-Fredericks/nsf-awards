 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much recent research has focused on the role of place in social            organization and activity.  An active debate has ensued regarding the           relative importance of the residential community versus the workplace           as sites for the establishment of class identity and the creation of            conditions that encourage workers to organize labor unions.  This               doctoral dissertation research project will attempt to assess the role          of work- and home-based activities in the success of the International          Ladies Garment Workers Union and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of            America in New York City in the years before World War II.  Through             examination of archives containing papers from both unions and labor            leaders, through analyses of other printed materials, and through               interviews with labor and community leaders, the investigator will              demonstrate how community-related programs played a crucial role in the         unions' success and how abandonment of those programs contributed to            the unions' decline after World War II.                                              This research will provide detailed insights based on primary              materials to clarify the nature of residential locales in the social            process of union organization and activity.  Although focusing on a             case study, the analysis will provide a basis for comparison with               studies of other organizations in other locales, thereby expanding              general understandings of these important processes.  This project also         will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising graduate student          to expand and refine her basic research skills.",
