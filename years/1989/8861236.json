(1) To                    explore \"image compression technologies\" to determine the capability            of \"StyleBits, StyleBytes and StylePieces\" as the means to reduce a             complex garment pattern to a manageable index that can be sorted for            databases and be manipulated in an electronic interactive                       encyclopedia of apparel information and for Electronic Data                     Interchange.  (2) To determine the feasibility of \"StyleBits,                   StyleBytes & StylePieces\" as a foundation or base for codification              and a language that could manipulate most style information in the              fashion industry.  (3) To examine CD ROM and Hypercard, as the                  technologies with enough memory and multimedia capabilities, for                being the computer tools to build an interactive encyclopedia of                codified style and fabric information.  (4) To study the broad needs            of the whole fashion industry for a language that would enable them             to communicate faster and better with each other.  Groups will be               utilized that contain every possible future user of an encyclopedia             index of fabric and style information ... such as, consumers who                wear clothing and consumers who sew clothing; retailers, buyers and             editors who evaluate clothing; designers, pattern technicians and               production managers who create and produce clothing; consumer                   consultants, public and private educators and both vocational-high              school and college level students who train and learn in fashion                retailing, manufacturing or related three-dimensional product                   industries.  (5) To compare the visual and tactile cognition of                 fabrics and styles to the most recent discoveries in cognitive                  psychology, in electronic pattern recognition and in developments of            Expert Systems that could support interactive decision making with              this visual and tactile information.",
