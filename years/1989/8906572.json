 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides resources to procure equipment to support                   research in four areas, including peg in hole insertion in                      compliant assembly using industrial robots, bearing fault                       detection, mechanisms of segregation in vibratory particulate                   motion, and mechanical structural responses.  The equipment                     comprises a vibration exciter system, several accelerometers and                displacement sensors, a stroboscope, an IBM PC-AT based data                    acquisition system, and an X-Y plotter.  The assembly task focuses              on vibration assisted compliant insertion, and includes analysis                of the kinematics and dynamics of the insertion process as well as              an experimental study to investigate the effects of various process             parameters including vibration frequency, vibration amplitude,                  compliance, and tolerance.  The fault detection research is an                  alternative machine diagnostics approach to the classical detection             scheme which uses experimental results.  The method's effectiveness             is tested experimentally for bearing systems.  The particle                     dynamics research attempts to understand the mechanisms of                      particle-particle and particle-wall collisions which are                        characteristic of many processes involving powdered and granular                materials.  The mechanical responses study focuses on machine                   subsystems including machine supports and gear trains.",
