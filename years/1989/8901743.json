These radio sources are                        associated with the nuclei of quasars and active galaxies, where                enormous amounts of energy are emitted on very short timescales,                probably due to the infall of material onto a supermassive black                hole.  The energy manifests itself as radiation on all parts of                 the electromagnetic spectrum.  At radio wavelengths we see                      compact radio-emitting `cores' and `jet-like' features, that vary               rapidly in both total intensity and polarization.  In many                      sources, bright knots of emission appear to be moving down the                  jets at several times the speed of light.  The goals of the                     observations are:  (1), to map the topology of the magnetic field               structures and to study their evoulution; (2), to obtain                        kinematic and geometric information to constrin models of                       superluminal sources; (3), to help understand the differences                   between differnt classes of compact radio sources; (4), to probe                the plasma surrounding the rdio sources in the innermost regions                of quasars and active galactic nuclei; and (5), to study the                    relationship between the milliarcsecond radio structure and the                 large scale (much greater than 1 arcsecond) jets and lobes found                in extended radio sources.",
