 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase equilibrince will be determined for the polyethylene - propane            system, including both solid-liquid and liquid-gas phase boundaries,            using a view cell (isopleth method).  This method was successful in             earlier work with unfractionated polyethylene at 100 to 130 degrees             centigrade and 9,000 to 11,000 psi.  Data will be collected on                  fractions of high density polyethylene.  The effect of agitation                during crystallization on polymer morphology will also be examined.             The data will be used to design and test a semi-continuous process for          the fractionation of high density polyethylene by crystallization from          a supercritical fluid.  Although polymers have been shown to be                 fractionable by molecular weight from supercritical fluids, such                processes have been based on the coexistence of liquid and gas phases.          The process attempted here will be based on solid/supercritical gas             coexistence.                                                                                                                                                    Advanced polymer technology plays a central role in scenarios for               development of advanced engineering materials.  One critical aspect of          advanced polymer manufacturing is production of polymers with a narrow          molecular weight distribution.  By economically separating polymer              molecules by molecular weight after polymerization this technology              becomes another tool for producing advanced materials.",
