 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will analyze how cartilages, bones, and muscles               develop in the various stages of developing fish larvae and                     juveniles.  Changes in the proportions and relative sizes of the                skeletal elements and muscles will result in drastic changes in                 the respiratory and feeding abilities.  Whether a developing fish               will survive these critical periods depends on the proper timing                and differentiation of functional systems which will be studied                 in this project.  It is known that there is an enormously high                  mortality of fish larvae during critical developmental stages.                  These studies will elucidate the patterns and mechanisms of                     development in fishes with free-living larvae and in live-bearing               fishes in which the larvae are protected from environmental                     hazards.  By comparing these two groups it will be possible to                  gain a precise knowledge of the factors governing the development               of fishes.  Such a study is expected not only to promote                        theoretical evolutionary knowledge, but also practical                          applications in reducing or managing mortality of fish larvae.",
