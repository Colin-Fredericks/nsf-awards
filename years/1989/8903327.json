Mark, Director of Polymer Research Center, University                  of Cincinnati and Drs. Burak Erman and Ivet Bahar of the Polymer                Research Center, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey.  The                    research is to study polymer chains of short length arranged in                 networks under very high levels of deforming forces.                            Observations of particular interest will be to determine the                    segmental orientation, preferential orientation and the                         rotational changes of the polymers, particularly the                            crystallization of materials under large strain loads causing                   rupture.  This study is intended to develop a molecular                         understanding of the ultimate properties of elastic materials,                  and the use of such information in the design of better                         high-performance materials.                                                                                                                                     Scope:  This proposal is a real opportunity for the two Turkish                 co-principal investigators to begin to establish an active                      research group working in polymers at Bogazici                                  University.  Such a research group is a needed addition to the                  University, which is experiencing a growth in the number of                     highly capable undergraduate students.  These students are                      selected from the top 1% of the 500,000 high school students                    examined annually in nationwide central examination.  Bogazici                  University is modeled on the U.S. university system and conducts                its courses in English, which makes is popular with those                       students hoping to take higher degrees outside of Turkey.  There                is a growing interest in polymers in Turkey spurred by a rapid                  growth in Turkish production of polymeric systems.  This                        proposal fulfills an objective of the Science and Developing                    Countries Program through the exchange and transfer of                          scientific knowledge.",
