Based on work                                       done on storm regionalization and a                                             probabilistic approach to storm                                                 transposition, the first part of the                                            investigation includes the assessment of                                        extreme storm data base and development of                                      estimation methods to account for record                                        incompleteness; develop stochastic spatial                                      models; study the feasibility of analytic                                       asymptotic approximations to the tails of the                                   distributions using extreme value theory; and                                   determine the reliability of alternative                                        estimation procedures and quantify the                                          uncertainty of the exceedance probability                                       estimates.  The second part comprises                                           research on the spatial variability of                                          several basin characteristics relevant to                                       rainfall/runoff transformations under extreme                                   conditions; study and assess the effects of                                     land use changes on resulting floods for the                                    homogeneous conversion of storm data bases to                                   floods; investigate the performance of                                          several rainfall/runoff models for converting                                   extreme rainfall into flood hydrographs; and                                    integrate all findings into a method for                                        estimating probabilities of extreme floods                                      and assess the reliability of those                                             estimates.  The third part is to apply the                                      developed models to real systems and to                                         incorporate them into a risk-based decision                                     making framework.",
