 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an interdisciplinary project to study the chemical engineering          aspects of organometallic vapor phase epitaxy (OMVPE).  It involves an          interdisciplinary team of two chemical engineers and two materials              scientists.  The team has selected a known but important system, the            homo- and heteroepitaxial growth of cadmium telluride onto cadmium              telluride and gallium arsenide surfaces.  There are three aspects of            the study:  1.  Modeling of the deposited films as a function of                temperature, alkyl mixture, and flow in an impinging jet reactor with           uniform heat and mass transfer characteristics.  2. Study of the                surface chemical kinetics by thermogravimetric analysis to develop              surface kinetic constants to feed into the model developed in the first         study.  3.  Evaluation of the electronic and structural quality of the          films as they are formed under different conditions, as identified with         the help of the model.                                                                                                                                          The great value of this project is in the combination of well                   thought-out reactor geometry and materials selections, with adequate            tools for materials characterization, together with a well-planned,             fundamental approach to understanding and controlling the physics and           chemistry of the OMVPE process.  Processes of this type will play a             central role in the development of future high-tech industries, which           richly justifies the investment necessary to understand these processes         in as full a manner as possible.  This improved understanding will              translate into improved quality of products and into greater                    efficiencies in the industries which employ them.",
