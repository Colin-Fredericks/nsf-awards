 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to conduct research on a novel                 water treatment process that offers promise in accomplishing a                  disinfection effect without producing halogenated hydrocarbons                  which have been determined to be carcinorganic.  The project                    involves determination of the ability of selected chemical                      nucleophiles, especially sulfites to decompose mutagenic or                     carcinogenic chlorination byproducts, to evaluate the degree to                 which additional chlorination byproducts form upon                              rechlorination following electrophilic decomposition, and to                    identify some of the degradation products of these halogenated                  compounds. The identification and recovery of specific                          compounds will be achieved by liquid/liquid extraction and                      closed loop stripping in conjunction with gas chromatography                    and mass spectrometry.  Such information will be combined                       with health-effects data from on-going research elsewhere to                    provide an overall evaluation of the potential of nucleophilic                  decomposition for drinking water treatment.  This research may                  lead to the development of a full-scale application of                          nucleophiles in the form of dechlorinating agents or anionic                    resins.                                                                                                                                                         The single most significant contribution of drinking water                      treatment to public health in the US has been the widespread                    use of chlorination.  Since its general acceptance in the US in                 the early part of this century, water borne diseases have been                  effectively controlled, and in some cases virtually eliminated.                 Now, concerns over organic chlorination byproducts are                          threatening to remove chlorination from consideration for many                  raw waters.  This research may lead to concepts that will                       continue to permit use of chlorine for disinfection without                     production of potentially harmful by products.",
