 "awd_abstract_narration": "The time-varying nature of ex ante predictable movements across                 different assets has emerged as an empirical regularity in recent               studies of foreign exchange, the term premium, and stock returns.               Dr. Lewis will investigate the potential effects upon these ex ante             returns from changing variances of fundamentals.  She will study these          effects by addressing three basic questions:  (1) During periods of             significant changes in the variance of fundamentals, do risk premia             across different types of assets move systematically in the direction           implied by the ICAPM?  (2) Are the variances of fundamentals                    sufficiently mean-reverting to help explain the empirical puzzle found          in Lewis (1988), that the constant covariance (\"beta\") ICAPM is                 rejected at shorter but not longer horizons?  (3) If variances of               fundamental change periodically, do market expectations of these                potential shifts exacerbate the time-varying nature of returns?                                                                                                 Dr. Lewis will teach a Ph.D. level course in international                      macroeconomics/finance.  In addition, she will conduct faculty                  seminars based on her research, attend faculty meetings, counsel women          graduate students, and present business and government women economist          guest speakers to undergraduate students.                                                                                                                       This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
