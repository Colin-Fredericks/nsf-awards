 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry provides                     support for the research of Dr. Robert Moss, Rutgers                            University. The work is focused on the direct observational                     studies of carbenes, which are a class of important reaction                    intermediates in organic chemistry. They are important because                  of their unusual reactivity which arises because carbenes are                   electron deficient and can exist in more than one accessible                    electronic state.                                                                                                                                               Fundamental studies of carbenes and other highly reactive                       intermediates will be carried out by direct spectroscopic                       observation and absolute kinetic methods.  The diazirine halide                 exchange reaction will be used to prepare novel diazirine                       precursors for dimethoxycarbene and fluoromethoxycarbene.  For                  dimethoxycarbene, spectroscopic, absolute kinetic, activation                   parameter, and reactivity studies will define the behavior of                   this representative nucleophilic carbene. Parallel studies will                 be made with fluoromethoxycarbene.  The free energies of                        activation of the carbene/alkene addition reactions will be                     determined and analyzed for enthalpy/entropy partition. Other                   carbenes to studied include methoxymethylcarbene,                               fluoromethylcarbene, and dimethylaminomethoxycarbene.                           Activation parameters will also be measured for additions of                    phenylhalocarbenes to hindered alkenes, where unusual behavior                  has already been observed. Finally, several methods of                          generating carbonium ion from diazirines and carbenes will be                   studied.",
