 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by Anthony Czarnik of Ohio State University is                     within the Organic Dynamics Program, and will investigate the                   rate of organic reactions based on proximity effects.  Model                    chemical systems will be designed so that reactants and                         catalysts will be brought together by stable chemical bonds                     which may later be broken through known, reversible chemical                    reactions.  This work will lead to increased knowledge about                    the way molecules recognize one another.                                                                                                                        Work will be continued on the development of catalytic systems                  based on reversible covalent bond formation that will mediate                   synthetic conversions of alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl                        compounds.  In this context, work will continue on the                          Diels-Alder approach to enzyme models and enzyme mimics.                        Methods to remove the degree of freedom between ligand and                      functional groups in cycloadducts will be investigated using                    bridged imidazole-anthracenes and tetraazaanthracene adducts,                   as well as the adducts with 2,5-bis(TMEDA)furan.  The reverse                   Michael addition reaction will also be explored as a basis for                  catalytic cycles operating at much lower temperatures than the                  cycloaddition processes.  Metal complexes based on the \"proton-                 sponge\" structure (N,N,N'-trimethyl-1,8-diaminonaphthalene)                     will be evaluated as Michael donors and as part of activated                    Michael adducts.  An analysis of the metal-catalyzed retro                      Michael reaction is also planned.",
