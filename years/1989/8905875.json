 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Professors Lipsman, Herb, Kudla, and Rosenberg               is made under the Mathematical Sciences Research Groups                         initiative. It will support postdoctoral associates, visitors,                  and graduate students in a series of collaborative projects in                  representation theory. Specific foci are representations of p-                  adic groups, symmetric spaces, and group C*-algebras.                                The research will deal with various aspects of the                         representation theory of Lie groups, which bear the name of the                 Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie. One basic example of a Lie                  group is the group of rotations of a sphere, where the group                    operation consists of following one motion by another. Detailed                 information concerning this group is very helpful in solving                    mathematical or physical problems in which spherical symmetry is                present. Other groups of motions capture other kinds of symmetry.               A more algebraic (as opposed to geometric) source of examples of                Lie groups comes from the multiplication of matrices. The group                 of all invertible real (or complex) matrices of a given size is a               Lie group, as is just about any subgroup thereof that can be                    described in a natural manner. It is desirable to be able to go                 back and forth between the geometric and algebraic points of                    view, for instance to consider the numerous ways in which the                   rotation group of the sphere can be realized as a group of                      invertible matrices. This, roughly, is representation theory.                   Facts about the representations of a given group tend to store a                lot of information very economically. Depending on where the                    group in question comes from, this information can impinge on                   almost any subject from number theory to mathematical physics.",
