 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transformation of manufacturing activities in the United               States and the rest of the world has engendered profound changes in the         location of industrial activity.  Similarly, changing patterns of               foreign investment have been documented and analyzed.  Relatively               little effort has been made to merge these two themes, however, thereby         shedding new light on how investments by foreigners have altered                production patterns in the U.S. and elsewhere.  This doctoral                   dissertation research proposal will analyze two facets of Japanese              investment in U.S. manufacturing.  First, data on Japanese investment           in different states will be statistically analyzed in order to provide          a more detailed description and theoretically based explanation of              those patterns.  Second, an analysis of the ways in which U.S.-based            Japanese manufacturers have used materials transfers to integrate               themselves into the economy at a number of geographic scales will be            based on data gathered through a survey of manufacturing executives.                 This project will provide direct and indirect benefits.  It will           contribute to general scientific understanding by providing an                  empirical analysis of some relevant theories.  It will have practical           implications through its examination of the geographic patterns of              investment and materials linkages of Japanese industrial firms                  operating in the U.S., and it will provide an excellent opportunity for         a promising graduate student to expand and refine his basic research            skills.",
