 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work continues mathematical research on boundary value                problems for homogeneous equations of elliptic systems and higher               order equations.  The work emphasizes domains whose boundaries                  lack the smoothness assumptions often assumed in such studies.                  It is this lack of smoothness (corners and edges are allowed, for               example) which  provides an avenue for direct application of the                results to concrete physical problems where relatively rough                    boundaries are the rule rather than the exception.                                   The equations are multi-dimensional, given with boundary                   data belonging to various function classes such as the Lebesgue                 spaces, Hardy spaces, BMO and Sobolev spaces.  Solutions are                    given in terms of boundary integral equations.  However, because                the boundaries lack smoothness, the resulting integral equations                must be solved without recourse to the classical Fredholm theory.               Certain techniques have been developed which have led to                        significantly improved maximum principle results of Agmon-Miranda               type for higher order operators such as the bilaplacian and                     certain systems.  Specifically, one wants to estimate integrals                 of gradients of solutions in terms of the gradient along the                    boundary.  The estimates are to be independent of the boundary                  function and should only depend on the shape of the domain's                    boundary. This leads to singular integrals which require new                    techniques.  For the bilaplacian, very general results                          have been obtained in two and three dimensions.  The methods                    cannot be extended to higher dimensions, and it will be the                     primary goal of this project to find the correct estimates for                  the higher dimensional cases both for single equations as well as               for systems.  Typical sources for such equations are                            hydrostatics and electrostatics.",
