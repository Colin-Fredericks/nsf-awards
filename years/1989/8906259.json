 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two of the major factors that affect the foraging patterns                 of insect herbivores are hostplant chemistry and natural                        enemies.  However, the relative importance of hostplant chemistry               and predation in determining foraging patterns of insect                        herbivores and the degree to which these factors interact are                   largely unknown.  The range of expression of hostplant defensive                chemistry, using a system of iridoid glycosides in plaintain,                   will be controlled using cloned genotypes that have been                        previously characterized chemically.  In an experimental garden,                the foraging patterns of two caterpillar species, a specialist                  and a generalist, in the absence and presence of two different                  kinds of invertebrate predators, wasps and stinkbugs, will be                   assessed.  Concurrently, the corresponding iridoid and                          nutritional chemistry of the hostplant , and the iridoid                        chemistry and growth rate of the caterpillars will be determined.               In addition, plant fitness due to the presence and absence of the               herbivores' predators will be examined.  The results will                       indicate the relative importance of hostplant chemistry and                     predators in determining the ecology of foraging patterns of two                representative caterpillar species and the ensuing effects on the               herbivores' hostplant.",
