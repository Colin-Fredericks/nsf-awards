 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to provide education in                          science content and instructional methodology to 35, grade 4                    - 8 teachers.  The teachers will be from the predominantly                      Hispanic and Black areas of Los Angeles Unified School                          District (East Los Angeles and Watts).  Major outcomes of the                   proposed project include increased teacher knowledge of                         science content; increased integration of reading,                              mathematics and science; and increased skills in teaching                       science through a process approach.                                                                                                                             The program will be conducted by science and education                          faculty from California State University, Los Angeles; they                     will be assisted by classroom teacher consultants from                          previously funded National Science Foundation projects.  The                    program will consist of 24 six hour days in a six-week summer                   session during July and August of 1989.  During two days of                     each week of the summer session, presentations on major                         science concepts will be made, followed by two days of hands-                   on experience with appropriate science instructional                            activities which are related to the science content                             presentations.  Along with the introduction of a process                        approach to science instruction, project participants will be                   prepared to integrate reading/language and mathematics skills                   in the science program.  Participants will initiate and carry                   out projects related to their classroom responsibilities.                       Graduate students from underrepresented minority groups will                    be employed to supervise the day-to-day work of project                         participants during the workshop.                                                                                                                               During the academic year period from October 1989 to March                      1990, project staff will make monthly follow-up visits to                       project participant teams in their schools.                                                                                                                     This program presents the opportunity of offering a program                     in a metropolitan area with a high percentage of minority                       students.",
