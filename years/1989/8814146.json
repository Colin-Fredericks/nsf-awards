 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. James                Bamburg, Colorado State University, and Dr. Dennis Bray, Cell                   Biophysics Unit, Medical Research Coucil, London.  In this project              Dr. Bamburg and Dr. Bray will investigate the sites of assembly of              actin into the neuronal cortex using fluorescence  and electron                 microscopy.  Actin filaments are the major cytoskeletal element of              the neuronal growth cone and comprise the core structure of                     microspikes, pseudopodia which extend from the growth cone and                  which generate the tension required for directed neurite growth.                Drs. Bamburg and Bray plan to identify putative complexes between               actin and other proteins in transit to the axonal cortex.  The                  proposed experiments should determine if actin subunits exchange                between the filament population in the axon during transport, and               if the cortical actin layer of the axon arises from deposition at               the growth cone or the shaft.                                                                                                                                   During the course of the project, Dr. Bamburg will prepare                      proteins for microinjection; Dr. Bray will prepare antibodies                   against the fluorescent labels.  The microinjections studies will               be carried out in both laboratories.  The proposed studies are                  well suited for collaboration between these two laboratories.  Dr.              Bray has been a leader in the development of neuronal culture                   methods, production of antibodies to neuronal cell proteins, and                the application of immunocytochemical methods for other                         localization of proteins within neurons.  Dr. Bamburg has been                  active in isolation and characterization in vitro of proteins                                                            ________                               involved in cytoskeletal structures and in regulating assembly of               cytoskeletal components.",
