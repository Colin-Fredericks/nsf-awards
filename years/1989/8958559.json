 "awd_abstract_narration": "Van Veen         This research involves the development and evaluation of  efficient, high performance signal processing algorithms for  signal estimation and detection.  Algorithms for processing data  collected at arrays of sensors and for analysis of time series  are of particular interest.  One technique for reducing the  complexity and improving the performance of signal processing  algorithms is based on mapping data into subspaces prior to  processing.  Mapping of data into subspaces is appropriate for  almost all signal processing problems, and is especially  applicable, if not mandatory, to problems in which large  quantities of data must be processed.  A key issue under study is  the design of linear transformations which maximize performance  while minimizing subspace dimension.         Processing of data mapped into subspaces is being explored  in adaptive beamforming, adaptive filtering, spectrum estimation,  and source location estimation problems, as well as in more  general nonlinear signal processing algorithms.  Determination of  appropriate performance criteria for transformation design and  tradeoffs between performance and complexity are under  investigation.  Statistical analysis and simulation are being  utilized to analyze the performance of the resulting algorithms.",
