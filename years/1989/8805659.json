 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lichens are important not only as the best-known example of                biological symbiosis but also as sources of a huge array of                     unusual chemical products.  These compounds characterize chemical               races or \"chemotypes\" into which many morphological species have                become differentiated over evolutionary time.  The interpretation               of these chemotypes, whether as polymorphisms within chemically                 variable panmictic species (and potentially of microevolutionary                importance) or as reproductively isolated sibling species (and                  consequently of taxonomic significance), is the root of a long-                 standing controversy.  The Culbersons at Duke University will                   investigate possible measures of gene flow among lichens, looking               at the six different chemotypes of the morphologically identical                Ramalina siliquosa complex.  These lichens grow in bands on the                 rocky coasts of western Europe, and in this respect behave                      ecologically like distinct species.  Tests will be made on                      laboratory cultures of lichen thalli grown from single-spore                    isolates taken from nature; parent and progeny samples will be                  made at the interfaces of the bands or zones of lichen                          chemotypes.  Mixtures of chemotypes among the progeny of                        individual lichens will indicate the presence of sexual                         reproduction and gene flow in these lichens.  The results will                  introduce new experimental techniques for study of the biological               species concept into lichen systematics and open the door for                   genetic studies of these dual organisms.",
