 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is directed at the development of a novel and                 highly selective membrane for the continuous purification of                    valuable proteins such as interferon from complex and dilute                    mixtures.  Production of proteins requires three main steps:                    fermentation or cell culture, isolation, and purification.                      Fermentation and cell-culture processes have undergone much                     development; isolation and purification are now the weakest parts               of the overall scheme.  The goal of the Phase I program is to                   establish the feasibility of employing \"affinity membranes\" to                  purify hydrophobic proteins.  The affinity membrane consists of a               microporous membrane in which the pores have been filled with an                affinity ligand that selectively binds the desired protein.                     Transport of proteins across the filled pores occurs by                         dissolution into and diffusion through the pores.                               Alpha-chymotrypsin is an inexpensive protein that will be used as               a model compound in Phase I; it is a good substitute for proteins               like interferon, which are of very high added value.  Preliminary               calculations indicate that the membrane-based purification of                   interferon can be performed by the membranes to be developed in                 the project at a cost as low as $0.46/million units of                          interferon--less than 1 percent of the current selling price.

The goal of the Phase I program is to                   establish the feasibility of employing \"affinity membranes\" to                  purify hydrophobic proteins.  The affinity membrane consists of a               membrane in which the microscopic pores, which normally allow                   water to channel through the membrane, have been filled with an                 immobilized solution of molecules which selectively bind the                    desired protein.  Proteins will be transported across the filled                pores as they dissolve into the immobilized solution inside the                 pore and diffuse through to the other side, where they will be                  collected in an appropriately buffered water solution.                          Alpha-chymotrypsin is an inexpensive protein that will be used as               a model compound in Phase I; it is a good substitute for proteins               like interferon, which are of very high added value.

In               contrast, a general rule of thumb in conventional separations of                proteins produced by fermentation or cell culture is that the                   separation costs account for 90 percent of the final cost of the                product.",
