 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Discovery will bring 20 junior high school students from                Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa to Central Missouri State                  University for interdisciplinary science exposures.  The three-week             program will provide lecture, laboratory, and field experiences in              chemistry, physics, biology, and earth science.  Program activities will        help students determine science fields for which they have aptitudes, to        make more informed career choices.  Students will select a \"discovery           project\" from one of the four science disciplines.  Students will be            guided in application of the scientific method as they work on their            projects.  Students will report their progress to their peers and, where        appropriate, will be encouraged to continue their project at their              school.                                                                                                                                                         The students will tour four scientific concerns in the Kansas City area         to learn of career opportunities in science.  Panel discussions will be         conducted during the three-week program which will deal with research           methodology, science careers, and the philosophy and ethics of science.",
