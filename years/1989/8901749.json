 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will further expand our understanding of the                      biochemical bases for the antimetabolic and insecticidal                        properties of canavanine and canaline and the ability of                        resistant insects to detoxify and degrade these compounds.                      Lysozyme is employed to analyze the overall process whereby                     canavanine ultimately replaces arginine within a structurally                   aberrant, canavanyl protein and Manduca sexta is used to                        probe the molecular details of the relationship of canavanine                   to arginine in protein synthesis.  Studies involving the                        interaction of canaline with pyridoxal phosphate will expand                    our knowledge of its effects in and metabolism by insects.                      The biochemical basis for the ability of resistant insects to                   detoxify and degrade canavanine and canaline will be                            elucidated by:  a) isolating, purifying and describing the                      enzymes constituting the canavanine and canaline metabolic                      detoxification system of the canavanine-resistant, tobacco                      budworm, Heliothis virescens, b) isolating and identifying                      the in vitro and in vivo reaction products of canavanine and                    canaline catabolism, c) analyzing the interaction of other                      protective allelochemicals with this metabolic detoxification                   system, and d) preparing inhibitors of the                                      canavanine-canaline metabolic detoxification enzyme(s).%%%                                                                                                      Living systems produce at least 600 nonprotein amino acids.                     These compounds possess a rich structural diversity and                         elicit unusual and valuable biochemical and biological                          properties.  Two of these compounds are canavanine and its                      metabolic derivative, canaline.  Canavanine is interesting in                   that it is a highly toxic natural product that exhibits                         deleterious effects in a diversified array of procaryotic and                   eukaryotic organisms ranging from viruses to humans.  Yet, it                   is innocuous to producer organisms, some of which are                           veritable canavanine storehouses.  Since both canavanine and                    canaline are widespread in legumes including some that are                      important for human and domestic livestock consumption, a                       more detailed knowledge of its metabolism by animals is                         desirable.  An understanding of the ability of resistant                        insects to detoxify and degrade these compounds is also                         important for any future use of natural products in insect                      control.***//",
