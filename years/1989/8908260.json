 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researcher will investigate the acquisition of general theory               of causality by observing examples of events and their                          consequences.  A theory of causality is information about the                   principles that lead one to believe that an action has a                        necessary consequence.  For example, people tend to select a                    cause which is close in space and time to an effect.  The work                  builds on prior implementation of a computer model which uses a                 theory of causality as an explicit bias to facilitate the                       acquisition of a theory of causation (i.e., inference rules                     encode knowledge of the effect of actions, such as \"glass objects               break when struck with sufficient force.\").  The new work is an                 investigation of computational models for acquiring these general               principles from examples.  Input to the learning program will                   consists of a temporal sequence of propositions representing the                states of the world.  The input representation will be                          constructed by simulation (to allow systematic experimentation by               varying parameters such as the amount of noise in the data) and                 by hand coding examples of causal changes from children's                       introductory  science texts (to insure that the learning program                will be able to account for a wide variety of common causal                     relationships).",
