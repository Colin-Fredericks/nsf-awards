Carroll of the University of              Oregon to conduct collaborative research for one year with Dr.                  Naohiko Sagara at Kyoto University and Dr. Naliaki Yoshida at the               Kyushu Branch of the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute            in Kumamoto, Japan.  They will investigate conifer - gall midge -               fungal endophyte associations to test whether the presence of                   symbiotic endophytes is responsible for preventing insect infestation           of the host conifer.                                                                                                                                            Endophytes are a recently discovered group of fungal symbionts which            form inapparent infections in the stems and leaves of higher plants.            In several cases, endophytic fungi have been shown to deter insect              attack or to kill insect larvae within the plant tissues.  Study of             the conifer - gall midge - endophyte association may have strong                practical implications in the forestry industry.  Likewise, it will             impact on studies of plant-insect interactions in general, including            the areas of coevolution, mutualism, and biocontrol.  The strong                research groups at Kyoto University and the Forestry and Forest                 Products Research Institute will complement Dr. Carroll's expertise             on conifer-endophyte systems.",
