 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell locomotion is characterized by a rearward flow of structures           at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm.  The objective of the proposal        is to test two current models of the mechanism of metazoan cell                 locomotion that explain  this rearward movement: Membrane flow, and             Cortical actin flow.  Fibroblasts will be surface labelled with                 antibodies to membrane proteins and microinjected with fluorescent              actin.  The redistribution of these probes during cell locomotion will          be monitored using digital video fluorescence microscopy,                       photobleaching, and electron microscopy.  The mobility of the membrane          probes with respect to actin assemblies in lamellipodia, arcs and stress        fibers will provide a critical test of the two models.  By                      microinjecting cells with actin-binding proteins the existence of a             forward flow of actin through the cytoplasm will be tested.                         The elucidation of the mechanism of cell movement will be of                fundamental importance to our understanding of the role of cell                 migrations in embryonic morphogenesis, in the inflammatory                      response, in wound healing, and other physiological process.",
