 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concentrated at the interface of                          probability and analysis, where martingales, harmonic analysis,                 analytic functions, and Brownian motion overlap.  Part of the                   research involves the study of a class of operators which are                   called the projections of martingale transforms.  Basic                         properties of these operators ares examined together with their                 connections to probabilistic products and to singular integrals.                     This research conducted at the border between analysis and                 probability, demonstrates an extensive and balanced knowledge of                both and results in a cross-fertilization where fundamental tools               in one area are applied to the other.  The research goes a long                 ways toward answering Gundy's 1983 conjecture that the law of                   the iterated logarithm, which holds for martingales, should also                hold for harmonic functions.  This is a fundamental question                    which asks for a precise description of how the two basic                       operators on harmonic functions, the nontangential maximal                      function and the Lusin area function, control each other.",
