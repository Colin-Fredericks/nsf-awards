 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued collaborative research between                Dr. Thomas O'Keefe, University of Missouri at Rolla and Dr. Rene                Winand, Free University of Brussels, Belgium.                                                                                                                   A major area of current technical importance is the processing of               high technology materials.  The electronics, chemical, aerospace                and automatic industries all rely heavily on such processing                    techniques.  Surface coatings and interfacial phenomena continue to             play a role in the material science related to these areas.  In                 this project, Drs. O'Keefe and Winand will expand their previous                research efforts on the topic of metal film processing on both                  conductive and non-conductive substrates.  The areas of primary                 emphasis will be the fundamental principles of thin metal film                  production.  The characterization and evaluation of the performance             and properties of such metal coatings, as a function of deposition              process parameters, will be included.  The techniques used will                 include both electrolytic and RF plasma enhanced organometallic                 deposition.  Specific work will also be carried out on mass                     transport measurements in aqueous metal deposition systems.  This               data is important to future high current density processes.  The                results of this joint work may lead improved understanding of                   factors affecting the properties of thin film.  Dr. Winand is a                 leading European electrochemist specializing in electrodeposition               of metals.  Dr. O'Keefe is well known for his work on zinc                      deposition.  This project will benefit from their combined                      expertise.",
