 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program, offered by the University of Michigan-Dearborn,                   will provide a four-week summer program and academic year                       follow-up activities for 30 secondary school natural science                    and social science teachers from the Detroit Metropolitan                       area.  The program will integrate the areas of biology,                         chemistry, earth science, social science, and environmental                     science.                                                                                                                                                        The Rouge River Watershed is the subject of intense scrutiny                    by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the                         media.  The pollution levels of the river are extreme and a                     Remedial Action Plan, which cites the importance of                             education, has been developed.  This interdisciplinary                          science program which relates the scientific, technological,                    and social dimensions of the problem and solutions will lead                    teachers and students to a greater understanding of science                     and its role in social problems.  Preference will be given to                   teachers who apply as a pair representing the natural                           sciences and the social sciences from a school so that team                     work and reinforcement can take place.                                                                                                                          The summer program will use a systematic approach to the                        analysis of the watershed.  Beginning with the geological                       history of the area and the formation of the watershed, the                     program will observe the numerous facets of the watershed and                   the quality of the environment by making visits to locations,                   such as point sources of pollution on the river as well as                      non-point sources away from the river.                                                                                                                          Subsequently the teachers will work in small groups as they                     analyze the component parts of the watershed, specifically                      the chemical, biological, and social components.  In the                        chemical analysis they will learn techniques for reliable and                   accurate water quality tests, the determination of dissolved                    oxygen, pH, biological oxygen demand, total phosphorus,                         nitrate, turbidity, and total solids.  In the biological                        analysis the teachers will learn sampling techniques,                           identification of aquatic organisms, significance of                            indicator organisms such as coliform bacteria, and flood                        plain ecology. In the social analysis they will learn the                       laws relating to water quality and flood plain usage,                           implementation of community water management programs, and                      the role of the citizen in their community.                                                                                                                     Throughout the program the workshop sessions will mold and                      incorporate the Rouge River Watershed information into the                      individual teachers' classroom materials.  The academic year                    follow-up program will include update sessions on the status                    of the Watershed and workshops on successful techniques of                      implementation of the material into the classroom.                                                                                                              This project focuses on the needs of minority and inner-city                    students.  The use of the environment where the teachers                        teach and the students live and conduct their everyday lives                    makes this project particularly suited to the Detroit                           Metropolitan area.",
