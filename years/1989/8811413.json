 "awd_abstract_narration": "Birds that naturally encounter high carbon dioxide, low oxygen                  environments as a consequence of nesting in underground tunnels or              cavities, show  blunted ventilatory responsiveness to carbon dioxide.           The altered thresholds and sensitivities of burrow-dwelling birds               clearly indicate that the set-point for their ventilation is different          from that of nonburrowers.  It is not known if the bluntered                    responsiveness of these birds to carbon dioxide is a genetically                determined and selected trait or if it is a phenotypic characteristic           that can be ontogenetically determined by the environment during                development.  The proposed research addresses this fundamental                  question of what establishes ventilatory set-points (i.e., are they             inherited or acquired).  In answering this question, the PI will                experimentally manipulate the gaseous environments during embryonic and         post-embryonic development of a burrower to determine if either                 treatment, or both, effects adult ventilatory set-points.  A parallel           set of experiments will be conducted with a nonburrowing bird.  The             proposed project will significantly contribute to our understanding of          respiratory control in birds, which is to date very incomplete.",
