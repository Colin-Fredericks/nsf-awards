 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines phenolic metabolism in disease development               in corn.  Hosts will provide genetically differential resistance                and susceptibility to the fungus Helminthosporium maydis, race O.               Changes in phenolic metabolism after infection include a                        significant increase in hydroxycinnamic acid: CoA ligase                        activity, and resistant and susceptible interactions are                        distinguishable by the CoA ligase isozyme response after                        infection.  The goals of this study are to: (1) characterize                    these isozymes, (2) define the isozyme response in resistant and                susceptible interactions, (3) purify the enzyme for polyclonal                  antiserum production, (4) clone and characterize the CoA ligase                 genes, and (5) characterize antisera for CoA ligase specificity.                                                                                                Symptoms of resistance suggest the involvement of phenols in                    response to infection in plants.  Blocking phenolic synthesis at                the level of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (an enzyme of                          phenylpropanoid metabolism) changes a normally resistant                        interaction into one of susceptibility.  Significant changes in                 phenols are detected throughout the infection and disease                       development processes, and the changes in resistance differ from                those in susceptibility.  This research will examine expression                 and regulation of phenolic metabolism in the fungal pathogen,                   Helminthosporium maydis.  This research will provide important                  information about the infection response processes in corn as                   well as new insights into disease resistance in general.",
