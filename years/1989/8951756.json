 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the quality work done by                             undergraduates in a required laboratory in the measurement of                   electronic, magnetic and optical properties of ceramic materials.               Acquisition of an impedance analyzer and a temperature controlled               chamber allows students to collect data for a variety of                        electronic materials over a wide range of frequencies and                       temperatures.  A group of instruments to measure the DC                         resistivity of materials from insulators to superconductors,                    including a versatile constant current source, a digital                        multimeter and a scanner were also purchased.  Funding support                  for these items represent the finalization of experiments that                  have been developed using borrowed research equipment and the                   refinement of educational experiments by instructors with over                  fifteen years experience in the teaching of materials                           characterization.  The permanent experimental systems also allow                the completion of a long desired laboratory manual.  This award                 is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                          investigator's institution.",
