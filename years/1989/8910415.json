 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optoelectronic light modulators, i.e. devices through which the                 transmission of light may be modulated by variation of an applied               control voltage, are of interest for applications in which electronic           control of guided light waves is required (e.g. fiber-optic                     commlunications systems).  The current state-of-the-art in such                 devices is the multiple-quantum-well (MQW) waveguide modulator, which           makes use of an electroabsorption effect called the quantum-confined            Stark effect (QCSE).  Significant improvements in MQW modulator                 performance may be possible, however, by exploiting an                          electroabsorption enhancement mechanism proposed here and termed the            \"field-induced absorption-edge mixing\" (AEM) effect.  The unique                valence-band configuration required to achieve this effect is                   available only in certain types strained-layer heterostructures which           have not yet been considered in electroabsorption studies.  A detailed          investigation of the hitherto unexplored AEM effect is the topic of             this proposal.                                                                                                                                                  Theoretical models of the field-dependent near-gap absorption                   characteristics will first be developed and used to design optimum              structures for maximum AEM effect.  Appropriate strained-layer MQW              structures will then be grown by metalorganic chemical vapor                    deposition (MOCVD), evaluated using low-temperature luminescence                techniques, and used to fabricate test structures.  Demonstration of            the AEM effect will then be attempted and, if observed, the effect              will be further characterized and its potential usefulness in optical           modulators assessed.  Observation large AEM effects at reasonable               control voltages - which seems promising based on fundamental                   considerations described in this proposal - could lead both to                  improvements in existing MQW waveguide modulators and to new                    optoelectronic devices such as voltage-controlled polarizers as well.",
