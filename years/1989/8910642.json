 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Frank               Joe, Jr. of the Food and Drug Administration to conduct collaborative           research for one year with Dr. Kunitoshi Yoshihira in the Division of           Food Additives at the National Institute of Hygienic Sciences in                Japan.  They will study the nature of the substances which arise from           the decomposition of antioxidants in synthetic oils, which are taken            up by foods prepared in these oils.  Relationships between the                  structural features of these decomposition products and those found             in real (natural) fat systems will be investigated.                                                                                                             Chromatographic separation techniques will be developed and used to             separate the major decomposition products of both artificial and real           fats subject to high-temperature treatment.  These compounds will               then be subjected to spectroscopic studies to determine their                   structural characteristics, and evaluated for whatever deoxidizing              properties that remain.  The past experiences of the U.S. and                   Japanese investigators in chromatographic techniques and food                   analysis complement each other in this project.",
