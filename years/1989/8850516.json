 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to prepare 50 outstanding                              middle/junior high school teachers (25 each year) in those                      field geology skills necessary to teach in the field and in                     incorporating field data/samples in their classroom and                         indoor laboratory teaching.  These resource teachers will                       then serve as resource persons for other teachers in their                      school districts as well as the surrounding areas.  The 28                      month program will begin in October, 1988 and terminate in                      January, 1991.                                                                                                                                                  The program will be comprised of the following four major                       components:                                                                                                                                                     Laboratory Institutes I & II.  These institutes will be held                    in the spring term of each year and will consist of three                       sessions lasting two days each.  These sessions will be                         centered around background information related to the summer                    activities.                                                                                                                                                     Field Geology Institutes I & II.  These institutes will be                      held during the summers of 1989 and 1990.  Each institute                       will consist of four weeks centered around field projects.                      Each week will be comprised of six days during which the                        participants will engage in field activities in Kansas                          geology in the area around the university.  The participants                    will also develop, utilizing a database, relevant activities                    for their own areas.                                                                                                                                            Site Visitations I & II.  During the fall and spring                            following each Summer Institute each participant will receive                   two site visits.  One visit is for the purpose of assessing                     the implementation of their in-service activities and one                       visit will be for the purpose of accompanying the teacher and                   class on a designed field activity.                                                                                                                             Master Science Teacher Development.  Five teachers will be                      selected during the fall semester of 1989.  In addition to                      leadership training, these Master Teachers will participate                     along with the project staff in planning activities for the                     second year.                                                                                                                                                    Six hours of graduate credit will be made possible, but not                     required, for each participant.                                                                                                                                 Most teachers of earth science have had only limited, if any,                   field experience in geology and rarely utilize the outdoors                     in teaching earth science.  This project allows the Teacher                     Enhancement Program the opportunity of providing content and                    methodology and ascertaining if students are subsequently                       provided with quality field experiences.                                                                                                                        Kansas State University and the school systems have                             contributed an amount equal to at least 15% (and probably                       higher) of the National Science Foundation award.",
