 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for the support of Communications, Signal Processing            Expert Systems and the Application Specific Integrated Circuit Design           (CSA) Laboratory in the Departments of Electronics and Computer                 Technology, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at North                Carolina A&T State University.  This Laboratory is an integration of            three ongoing research programs at NC A&T: i) the Communication Methods         Research Laboratory, ii) the VLSI Design Laboratory and ii) the Signal          Processing Laboratory which support a total of 7 faculty members 20             graduate (MS) students and 25 undergraduate students in the                     departments.                                                                                                                                                    This project will support an integrated facility of which algorithm             development, computer modeling and simulation, and application specific         VLSI design can take place in the aforementioned research areas.  The           facility will consist of 2 image processing/graphics workstations, 5            VLSI CAD workstations, 4 AI expert system workstations, dedicated file          and computational servers, data acquisition equipment, image I/O                devices, a high speed IC packaged chip tester, several application              software packages, and networking capabilities to SURNet.  The new              facility will not only expand and enhance current research projects but         will also create an environment which can initiate new projects in              communication, expert systems, and ASIC design.  Another byproduct of           the proposed facility is the support of computing activities for the            entire university, showing by example the impact that a dedicated               research laboratory can have at a Historically Black College or                 University (HBCU).",
