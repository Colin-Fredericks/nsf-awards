 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary research objective is to implement a program in                     which the nonlinear and unsteady fluid-body interaction                         problems that constitutes a free surface are solved                             accurately and efficiently.  Such problems are, for                             instance, the determination of exciting forces and                              responses of ships and platforms which are either partially                     restrained or freely floating, and of submerged bodies,                         like fixed and catenary pipelines in the coastal areas,                         Because of the computational difficulties in solving the                        exact governing equation of an Eulerian fluid subject to                        exact free-surface and solid-boundary conditions, most of                       the present research in this area is either concentrated on                     the solution of linear problems or on empirical methods.                                                                                                        The computational hydrodynamics research program proposed                       here will start with the determination of the relative                          efficiency and accuracy of several major numerical methods,                     such as the boundary-element, finite-difference, marker-                        cell and finite-element methods in solving the exact                            equations of potential theory for simple boundary                               geometries.  Because of the rather simple body geometries                       chosen initially, we will be also able to theoretically                         analyze the same problems by higher-order perturbation                          methods and compare the results with the numerical                              predictions.",
