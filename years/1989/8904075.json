 "awd_abstract_narration": "Removal of a number of regulatory proteins from photosystem II                  (PSII) results in a preparation containing seven protein                        subunits which is capable of light-induced oxygen evolution                     activity.  At the same time, these purification routines alter                  the properties of oxygen evolution and electron transfer in                     PSII.  These experiments will determine the origins of the                      changes in electron transfer activity.  Studies will be                         conducted to quantify the contents of pigments and                              plastoquinone in PSII during purification.  Removal of a 28 kDa                 chlorophyll-binding protein can be shown to induce alterations                  to herbicide-sensitive photoreduction of quinones; the                          properties of this protein will be examined to place it in the                  context of other known chlorophyll binding proteins as well as                  to determine its role in regulation of herbicide binding and                    quinone photoreduction.  Additional investigations will assess                  the roles of several PSII-associated proteins in providing                      sites for the binding of extrinsic polypeptides and attempts                    will be made to determine whether low molecular weight peptides                 which copurify with PSII are essential components of                            activity.%%%                                                                                                                                                    Photosystem II (PSII) catalyzes the light-driven 4-electron                     oxidation of water to molecular oxygen.  The use of relatively                  simple biochemical procedures permit the isolation of PSII from                 thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.  Application of non-ionic                  detergents to these membrane sheets permits the isolation of                    simpler preparations which contain reduced numbers of                           polypeptides, but which at the same time retain oxygen                          evolution activity.  Removal of various polypeptides from PSII                  induces alterations to electron transfer activity, and the                      repair of these alterations has proven useful in discovering                    new cofactors for the oxygen evolving reaction.  This research                  will deduce the roles of a selected set of largely                              uncharacterized polypeptides which, upon removal from PSII,                     induce changes to electron transfer activity.  It will also be                  determined whether low molecular weight polypeptides associated                 with PSII preparations play significant roles in electron                       transfer activity.***",
