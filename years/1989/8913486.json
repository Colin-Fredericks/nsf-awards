 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University         of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez (UPRM) will acquire new computing resources          to enhance the established academic programs and strengthen research            efforts.  These computing resources are required to attain the                  following goals:                                                                                                                                                     Develop a Master's Program in Computer Engineering within three                 years.                                                                                                                                                          Attract minority students, from the island and the mainland                     states, to careers and graduate education in computer                           engineering.                                                                                                                                                    Increase significantly the research output and the number of                    technical publications in learned journals.                                                                                                                     Strengthen the computing and connective infrastructure so that                  researchers can join the knowledge and information intensive                    environments made possible through networking within the academic               and industrial communities.                                                                                                                                     Build an infrastructure to promote faculty development and to                   create an environment for research.                                                                                                                             Develop a program of manufacturing-related research and                         development that will forge close ties with industry and foster                 future entrepreneurial product development for a world market.                                                                                             As the final outcome of this project, the number of trained minority            computer engineers entering the workforce from the institution at both          undergraduate and graduate levels will significantly increase in                quantity and quality.  The students and faculty will be able to use             computing equipment comparable to that used in industry in their                studies and their research.  Faculty will be able to conduct state of           the art research for both government and industry sponsors.",
