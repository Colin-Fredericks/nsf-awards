 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the sources of low-frequency                       variability in the extra-tropical atmosphere using simple                       numerical models of the general circulation and focusing on the                 role of synoptic variability in generating low-frequency motions.               These investigations, to be carried out using the two-layer                     primitive equation model on the sphere, will comprise the                       following:                                                                                                                                                      1)  Detailed diagnostic studies of the dynamics of low-frequency                variability generated during long integrations of the full model,               with and without orography.  These simulations are designated the               \"controls\".                                                                                                                                                     2)  Studies of \"truncated\" models that exclude the scales at                    which high-frequency variability is generated.  Only the average                effects, computed from the controls, of the high-frequencies will               be included.  Low-frequency behavior in these models will,                      therefore, be autonomous to large spatial and slow time scales.                                                                                                 3)  Experiments that include the forcing of low frequencies by                  synoptic variability:  the linear and nonlinear time-dependent                  barotropic responses to the forcing calculated from the controls                and to stochastic models of that forcing.                                                                                                                       4) comparisons, between the control and truncated models, of the                loss of predictability of low-frequency motions.                                                                                                                     This work will lead to an understanding of how synoptic                    scales contribute to low frequency variability of the atmosphere                and will enhance our capability to predict seasonal climate.",
