 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help fund a computerized undergraduate laboratory               in human sensory processing.  This laboratory will provide the                  tools for a wide range of experiments in audition and vision that               were not previously possible.  It will also provide a long                      lasting and versatile base for future experiments in the skin                   senses and motor control.                                                                                                                                       Twelve IBM/ATs have already been acquired through a grant from                  IBM for an undergraduate computer laboratory.  Funding of this                  proposal will enable seven of these computers to be quipped with                interfaces for the generation and presentation of auditory and                  visual stimuli and the collection of data.  Each of the seven                   computers will have one combined digital-to-analog and analog-to-               digital converter, an amplifier and headphones, an image frame                  store, display and software.                                                                                                                                    The laboratory will train undergraduates in modern computer                     laboratory skills, including programming, data analysis and                     instrument control.  Much of the recent progress in understanding               sensory processing has been made possible by computer technology.               The students will experience some of the excitement of these                    contemporary research issues in sensation and perception.                       Student will have the opportunity to develop individual research                projects that address current issues in sensation and perception.               The grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds                   from non-Federal sources.",
