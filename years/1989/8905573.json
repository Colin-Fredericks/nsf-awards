 "awd_abstract_narration": "In future distributed field production environments, intelligent                machines, like their human counterparts, will need to harness                   considerable knowledge to plan and control autonomous tasks in                  spite of the fact that they will be limited in their own                        knowledge.  However, no unifying theory and few guidelines exist                for defining and communicating knowledge about designs and field                operations in a way that can effectively be utilized by such                    machines.  Standard researchers are working toward such a theory                in  order to support the research of others on future                           applications of robotics in field conditions.  The research seeks               to discover and formulate a general cognitive and communications                core of theory and software for such machines, and do so in a                   fundamental way that can enable these robots to have common modes               of \"thinking\" and communicating that would provide them with the                ability to better deal with unexpected events and exploit the                   knowledge in their environment.",
