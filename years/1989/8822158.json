 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, powerful and inexpensive computers are situated near              individual users, and these computers are linked together either                locally or across long distances.  The computers are heterogeneous              because users require different capabilities; legislating the use of            identical systems in any organization seems as unlikely in the future           as it has been in the past.  Together with parallel processing,                 heterogenity and distribution are likely to be the dominant                     characteristics of computer systems during the next decade.                                                                                                     The advent of distributed, heterogeneous systems has led to some new            problems.  One particularly important problem is the lack of support            for sharing of programs and data in a safe and convenient manner across         a heterogeneous network.  This project is aimed at correcting this              problem by providing a language-independent object repository.  The             repository can be used by programs written in different programming             languages, and running on different hardware and under different                operating systems, to share information.  The new repository will be            language independent, will store typed, structured objects, will                support atomic transactions, will be both highly reliable and highly            available, will control access to its objects, will perform well, and           will be scalable, so that it can support a wide range of system sizes.",
