 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maintenance and repair are by far the greatest problems in the                  effective utilization of modern scientific instrumentation.  This is            particularly critical at community colleges and smaller colleges and            universities where the requisite expertise and adequate funds for               repair and maintenance may not be available.                                                                                                                    To provide assistance in dealing with these problems, Iowa State                University is offering a repair and maintenance service for                     scientific instrumentation to colleges and universities within Iowa             and adjacent states--a total of nearly fifty institutions.  The                 service is provided by trained electronics personnel working from a             mobile van outfitted as an electronics shop.  The project is                    patterned after, and was developed following consultation with, a               similar project at Georgia Tech that has received Foundation support            in the past and has been notably successful.                                                                                                                    Significant university support is also dedicated to support of the              project which, after the term of this award, is expected to become              self-supporting.",
