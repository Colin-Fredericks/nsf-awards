 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooperation is rare in animals, yet in species such as the                 African lion cooperation permeates all aspects of their lives.                  Cooperation is only expected to occur where animals associate                   persistently with their close kin, or where social interactions                 result in mutual benefit to each participant.  Gaining a full                   understanding of the evolution of cooperation therefore requires                information on the precise ways that cooperation is elicited, the               distribution of cooperative acts among companions of varying                    degrees of kinship and the effects of such cooperation on the                   participants' lifetime reproductive success.  Many different                    kinds of cooperative behavior in lions can be elicited by playing               the recorded roars of intruders in their territories.  In the                   next three years the investigators will perform playbacks both                  where the willingness of an individual to cooperate is visible to               its companions and where its behavior would be unseen.  Several                 other forms of cooperation will also be investigated under                      natural conditions.  The consequences of cooperative behavior in                these lions can be estimated from the 22 years of demographic                   data available on the study populations.  These studies provide a               unique opportunity to learn how animals have evolved complex                    forms of cooperative behavior.  The long term demographic data                  will also be used to develop detailed models of lion population                 dynamics.  These will be used to simulate the fates of                          populations of varying sizes and to calculate the potential                     impact of human disturbances on natural populations.",
