 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is concerned with developing and applying ideas from                complexity theory to three distinct but related areas of computation:           Under continued investigation are the theoretical possibilities for             general purpose parallel computers.  The problem is to devise idealised         high level models that are both convenient for the programmer as well           as efficiently simulated in realistic technologies.  As a distinct              topic in parallel computation the computational capabilities of                 brainlike models of computation are being studied.  Such neural models          appear to become more distinct from other complexity models if                  biologically plausible restrictions on time and space resources are             imposed.  Thirdly, partly in support of this latter work, the PI will           continue to investigate the limits of what can be learned or induced,           as imposed by such criteria as polynomial time computability.",
