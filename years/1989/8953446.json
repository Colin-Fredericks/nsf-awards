 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Policy Research in Education (CPRE) and the                 Center for Research on the Context of Secondary School Teaching                 (CRC) propose a three and one half-year study of the content and                effects of post-reform secondary school math and science.                                                                                                            The overall goals of this study are (1) to provide answers                 to the next generation of questions that local, state, and                      national policymakers will ask about the effects of reform and                  (2) to increase policymakers' understanding of the factors that                 affect curriculum decisions and student achievement in response                 to increase academic requirements.  The specific objectives of                  the study are (1) to fill a gap in existing research on                         curriculum regulation and student standards by conducting an                    intensive empirical study of actual content and its effects, (2)                provide the policy community with a complete picture of the                     effects of curriculum standards as they are actually implemented                in classrooms and schools and (3) to suggest how the design of                  state and local indicator systems can be modified and augmented                 to fill current gaps in understanding about student course-taking               and achievement.                                                                                                                                                     The project will be conducted under the guidance of Susan                  Fuhrman (Rutgers), CPRE's director.  Michael Kirst (CPRE-CRC,                   Stanford University) and Andrew Porter (CPRE-Wisconsin) will be                 co-principal investigators.  William Clune will serve as senior                 researcher.  Two project managers and several research assistants               will participate in the research.  Thomas Romberg (Center for the               Center Learning and Teaching of Mathematics), Senta Raizen                      (National Center for the Improvement of Science Education) and                  Brian DeLany (CRC-Michigan State) will consult with the project.                Milbrey McLaughlin (Stanford), CRC's director, will assure                      coordination with CRC research.  Other consultants include                      university and practitioner experts in math and science.                                                                                                            The study extends and builds on current CPRE and CRC                        research.  The up-close, classroom-level look at reform comprises               a critical but otherwise unaffordable element of the mission of                 both centers.  Conversely, without the existing research on                     district- and school-level effects of curriculum and student                    standards reforms at the two centers, the proposed study could                  not be efficiently mounted.",
