 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor                       William H. Saunders, Jr. of The University of Rochester will                    study the effect on chemical behavior caused by replacing one                   or more atoms in a molecule with an isotope (an atom with the                   same qualitative chemical behavior but a different atomic                       weight).  The difference in reaction rates caused by such                       replacements will lead to conclusions about the detailed                        pathways (mechanisms) of the particular chemical reactions in                   question. Such knowledge facilitates the use of the reactions                   to synthesize compounds of industrial and pharmaceutical                        interest.                                                                                                                                                       Major emphasis will be placed on exploring the influence of                     quantum mechanical tunneling on rates and isotope effects in                    proton transfer reactions.  In order to obtain such                             information, isotope effects and their temperature dependencies                 will be determined for bimolecular eliminations and                             deprotonation of aliphatic nitro compounds.  Another                            characteristic of tunneling that will be explored is                            noncumulative behavior of isotope effects in multiply labeled                   species (isotope effects on isotope effects).  Kinetic enolate                  formation and other reactions showing attenuated temperature                    dependencies will be studied.  Dr. Saunders will test the                       hypothesis that such abnormal temperature dependence can in                     many instances be attributed to reaction via more than one base                 species.  Isotope effect calculations will be performed as they                 are needed to interpret experimental results.",
