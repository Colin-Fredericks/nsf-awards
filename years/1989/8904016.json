 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program supports the work of                    Dr. Ihsan Erden.  Erden, an assistant professor of chemistry at                 San Francisco State University, is  studying how                                cyclopropanones, in equilibrium with allene oxides, can                         function as building blocks in organic synthesis.  This study                   will investigate fundamental structural and orbital influences                  on reactivity.  As knowledge is gained, applications to the                     synthesis of natural products will be attempted.                                                                                                                The project is concerned with the exploitation of                               functionalized allene oxides and cyclopropanones as                             multipurpose building blocks in organic synthesis.  A novel                     endoperoxide rearrangement will serve as a new route to these                   reactive species.  The cycloaddition reactions of these                         intermediates with appropriate 4-pi cycloaddends will be                        studied by examining new entries into a variety of natural                      products.  The main emphasis of the planned research is to                      establish the chemical behavior of these intermediates.  In the                 short term this will be the examination of the scope and                        limitations of the reactions, often tested in natural products                  synthesis.  Long term goals will be the complete understanding                  of the structure and reactivity of these reactive intermediates.",
