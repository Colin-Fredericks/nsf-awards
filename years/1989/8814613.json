 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Juan Sanchez of Columbia                      University in a research collaboration with Professor Francisco                 Mejia-Lira of the Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi, Mexico.              The investigators plan to continue their previously established                 research collaboration in the following areas:  phase equilibrium               in magnetic alloys; surface phenomena in close-packed structures;               ordering phenomena in superconducting ceramics; and thermodynamics              of small metallic clusters.  The main objective of the research is              the characterization of the effects of magnetic interactions and of             planar defects on alloy phase stability.                                                                                                                        To accomplish these objectives, several real and model alloy                    systems will be investigated using the cluster variation method of              statistical mechanics from which free energies can be calculated.               Because the techniques used by the researchers lie between strictly             analytical techniques and very computer intensive techniques (Monte             Carlo simulations) they are able to apply them to increasingly                  complex systems.  Consequently, the proposed work has the potential             for further application, particularly in the areas of magnetic                  recording where surface properties of magnetic materials are of                 critical importance.",
