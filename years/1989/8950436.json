 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infrared spectroscopy is one of the oldest and most                        important instrumental methods for identifying unknown                          substances.  In recent years there has been a breakthrough in the               instrumentation available for measuring infrared spectra.  Using                modern computer technology, it is now possible to obtain spectra                from samples which were previously difficult or impossible to                   analyze due to their weak absorbance or limited quantity.  The                  new experimental methods which the FT-IR spectrometer make                      possible for the first time.  This instrument allows use to carry               out rate studies for fast reactions and facilitates the                         conversion of the organic and inorganic chemistry labs to micro                 scale.  The instrument also serves as an example of the power of                using computers in data collection and digitized library                        searching, and provides students with hands-on experience working               with the type of instrumentation that they are likely to                        encounter in their future work.  The institution is matching the                NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
