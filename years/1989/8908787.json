 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the midst of growing participation of women in the labor force               generally and in service jobs in particular, numerous studies                   have explored the effects of women's employment per se on family                life. What these studies have largely neglected, however, are the               processes by which these effects (for example, on marriages) come               about, as well as the emotional aspects of work roles. This                     planning grant proposes several activities relevant to the PI's                 future research into the relationship between women's management                of emotional expressions on the job and the performance of                      women's roles in the home. Among these activities is the                        identification and measurement of emotional components of jobs,                 largely overlooked in the previous and extensive literature on                  job characteristics. Also planned are interviews with                           samples of women whose jobs involve extensive vs. modest                        emotional components and interviews with personnel managers of                  companies.",
