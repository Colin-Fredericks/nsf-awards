 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is              in the general area of analytical chemistry and in the subfield of              molecular spectroscopy.  The goal of this activity is to develop a              sensitive, stable, spectroscopic technique for the detection and                quantification of gas phase molecular species.  Gallium Arsenide                Laser Line-Locked Absorption Spectroscopy (GALLS) uses a near                   infrared laser-diode which is actively locked to a molecular                    absorption line to monitor the concentration of that molecular                  species in a gas sample.  This technique is species selective,                  sensitive, and can be used to monitor a large number of molecular               species.                                                                                                                                                        During the tenure of Phase I research under NSF grant ISI-8760819,              the principal investigator demonstrated continuous monitoring of                atmospheric water vapor with a detection sensitivity of ten                     microabsorbance units and a dynamic range in excess of four orders              of magnitude.  Research in Phase II will lead to the production                 of a laboratory prototype instrument having improved sensitivity                and stability.  This device will be used to measure detailed                    spectrometric constants for water vapor and to demonstrate the                  sensitivity, accuracy, and precision of GALLS sensors for various               monitoring applications.                                                                                                                                        This research should lead to the development of a new class of                  remote sensors for the real-time monitoring of gas phase species                concentrations in hostile environments.",
