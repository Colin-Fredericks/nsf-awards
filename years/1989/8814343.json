 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents continuing support by the Organic                       Dynamics Program for the research of Gerald R. Stevenson and                    Richard C. Reiter of Illinois State University.  The work                       involves the establishment of equilibria between neutral                        compounds and their negatively charged counterparts.  Since the                 position of equilibrium varies with particular isotopes, this                   has led to a new method for isotope separation.                                                                                                                 This research is directed at developing a thermodynamic scheme                  that can be utilized for the separation of molecular isotopic                   isomers.  The Illinois State group has previously observed that                 the solution state and solid state electron affinities of                       conjugated organic materials differing only by the substitution                 of one or more atoms with isotopically different atoms                          experience rather dramatic (up to several hundred cal/mol)                      changes.  This means that the reduction of organic isotopic                     isomers (e.g., benzophenone and benzophenone-O-18) with                         deficient molar amounts of alkali metal in solution will result                 in a competition between the two isotopic isomers for the added                 electrons.  Since the solution electron affinities of the two                   materials are not the same, the partial enrichment of the O-18                  isotope can be achieved as easily as separating the radical                     anions from the neutral molecules.  This method of isotope                      enrichment will be explored for a variety of isotopes including                 C-13, O-18 and N-15.  Further, a statistical thermodynamic                      model will be developed that can be utilized to predict the                     equilibrium constants for electron exchange between the                         isotopic isomers.",
