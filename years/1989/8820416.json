 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will be used to acquire computer hardware and general-               purpose peripherals to be incorporated into a panchromatic data                 reduction and analysis facility to meet the needs of the ground-                based astronomy programs at the Center for Astrophysics and Space               Astronomy.  By emphasizing the \"panchromatic\" needs of modern                   astronomical research, this facility should have the ability to                 reduce and analyze area-format data regardless of wavelength and,               moreover, should have the ability to intercompare these data as                 driven by scientific objectives.  Because this facility is being                designed to meet the needs of both ground- and space- based                     observations, funding for this facility is split among NSF, NASA,               and the University of Colorado.                                                                                                                                 Currently, the data load has far outstripped the capabilities of                the current system, based upon a micro-VAX II, so to be that a                  system with superior computational power and input/output                       implemented bus speed is now required.  The system is based upon                the recent purchase by the University of an Alliant FX/8 and                    allows an elegant solution to 2-D data reduction needs.                         Peripherals will be added to the Alliant to provide the                         computational power needed for major manipulations involving                    large format area detectors (e.g. bias subtraction and flat-                    fielding of CCD images and sorting, Fourier-transforming and                    \"cleaning\" of VLA images).  A workstation is also needed to allow               transfer of reduced data from the Alliant to CASA for image                     display, analysis and final output.  Thus, this proposed facility               neatly separates the CPU intensive tasks from the I/O intensive                 ones and provides the most efficient machines to deal with each.",
