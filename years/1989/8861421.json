 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key consideration in a variety of manufacturing                          processes is controlling either the position or shape of an                     interface defined as the boundary between liquid and solid                      materials of dissimilar composition or density to within                        certain allowable tolerances.  Examples of such diverse                         processes are vertical freeze Bridgman and Czochralski crystal                  growth Electroslag remelting for metal refinement.                                   A technique based on gamma ray transmission is ideal to                    provide information regarding interface position and curvature.                 However, existing methods that provide positional information                   are not suitable for application towards industrial automation.                 A method to monitor and subsequently control and interface                      boundary using an appropriate gamma ray emitting radioisotope                   and a rugged semiconductor detector will be developed.  The                     detector will be either a modified version of an existing                       device or a new unit, developed in-house, with superior                         detection performance capabilities.                                                  Research will focus on the development of gamma ray                        transport models and algorithms that will determine what the                    ideal component properties needed to fulfill specific                           requirements in terms of position resolution, detection                         efficiency and a timely presentation of the measured gamma ray                  intensity.  Experiments will be performed to demonstrate                        measurement capabilities such as sensitivity to small changes                   in either interface curvature or density.",
