 "awd_abstract_narration": "The instrumentation requested in this proposal will enhance                     the PIs research in animal-cell culture engineering and                         metabolic engineering of anaerobic bacteria by enabling the                     PIs to more closely monitor changes in cell metabolism and                      product expression.  The requested instruments will be                          initially used for three major research projects.  The first                    project investigates the effect of various environmental                        stresses on monoclonal antibody production by hybridoma cells.                  It will also examine the utility of stress-protein promoters                    for production of recombinant glycoproteins by animal cells.                    The second examines effects of the bioreactor hydrodynamic                      environment on the viability, metabolism, macromolecular                        synthesis, and product expression of animal cells in                            microcarrier and free-suspension reactors.  The third project                   will investigate the ability and means of altering the primary                  metabolism (metabolic engineering) of butyric-acid anaerobic                    bacteria (clostridia) in order to construct more efficient                      whole-cell biocatalysts for large scale anaerobic                               fermentations.",
