 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Jamie Thomerson of Southern Illinois          University at Edwardsville in collaboration with Professor Donald               Taphorn of the Universidad Nacional Experimental de los Llanos                  Occidentales in Guanare, Venezuela.  The investigators intend to                clarify the taxonomy, distribution, and natural history of Venezuelan           rivulids.  Members of a large Neotropical freshwater fish family the            Rivulidae, rivulids, live in marginal habitats.  Study of their                 distribution will provide tests for zoogeographic hypotheses based on           other fish groups.  While they are relatively well understood in terms          of higher phylogenetic relationships, the taxonomy of the non-annual            Rivulus species is muddled and inadequate study material is available.                                                                                          The PI's will concentrate their collecting on habitats where rivulids           live.  Many known localities are in areas undergoing rapid environmental        modification.  Live material will be collected for aquarium observation         and hybridization studies.  This study will:  (1) increase our knowledge        of diversity and distribution of Venezuelan rivulids; (2) clarify               taxonomic and systematic problems in the difficult genus Rivulus; and           (3) dramatically increase the amount of Venezuelan fish material                available for study.",
