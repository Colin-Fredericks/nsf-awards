 "awd_abstract_narration": "A rapidly growing body of research in the social sciences relates          to the development and distribution of human services.  Medical care is         an especially important service, but analyses of how and where care is          available have been limited by the absence of theory regarding the              development of medical care delivery systems that would integrate               findings from numerous case studies.  This project will develop the             theoretical basis for future research by building on findings in the            extant scholarly literature through a detailed analysis of the                  reciprocal development of primary medical care and residential patterns         in San Francisco between 1870 and 1930.  Information on the provision           of medical care and on the changing geography of people and housing             will be gathered from archival sources as well as from public data              sources.  This information will be analyzed statistically and                   cartographically to determine how changing population and housing               patterns affected and were reflected in changing patterns of primary            medical care.  Following the conclusion of the San Francisco historical         study, theory about the geographic evolution of urban medical care              will be explicitly reevaluated and enhanced in order to better explain          and interpret how urban and medical transformations have evolved.                    This research will provide one of the most rigorous and well               documented case studies of medical care system development ever                 conducted, but even more important, it will explicitly expand the               general theoretical framework relating to service system development            and residential development.  This theory will more effectively focus           future research projects, and the methodology used in the San Francisco         case study will be replicable in other locales and over different time          periods to permit ongoing reevaluation of the theory.",
