 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support to obtain a Time-Resolved                        Spectrofluorometer.  This equipment enables one to measure very                 fast processes, occurring in the time scales of microsecond to                  100 picoseconds, in biological energy conversion and light-                     induced structural changes in biomolecules and membranes.                                                                                                       The proposed instrument will be the only one of its kind at the                 University of Nebraska.  Since this instrument is essential in                  studying very fast reactions involved in biological energy                      conversion (as in photosynthesis and photobiology) and structural               changes of the biomolecules systems (as biomembranes and                        proteins), a number of researchers at UNL are expected to make                  use of this equipment in their research.  Graduate students will                also be exposed to this equipment for their training and                        graduate research.                                                                                                                                              The initial experiments anticipated to be performed with this                   equipment include studies of (1) the phototransformation of                     phytochrome, a light-regulator of gene expression for the                       biogenesis of photosynthetic apparatus in green plants, (2) the                 structure and topography of photosynthetic pigments, and (3)                    structure-function relationships and dynamic properties of DNA,                 proteins and model biological membranes.  The first two areas of                the proposed studies focus on elucidating the primary molecular                 processes of the tetrapyrrole-based photoreceptors in plant                     photobiological systems.",
