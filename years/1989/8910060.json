 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of maize developmental genetics is the                             identification and characterization of the genes that direct and                regulate the morphogenesis of the embryo and the plant.  The                    principal investigator and his coworkers have been characterizing               embryo-lethal mutations in several genes that play essential                    roles in the normal morphogenesis of the embryo.  A second                      project is aimed at characterizing two genes that regulate the                  development of the axillary meristems.  A major goal of these                   projects is to investigate the cellular autonomy of mutant                      expression of these genes.  This will be done by using x-rays to                break a chromosome arm carrying the normal allele, thereby                      producing genetically mutant sectors in otherwise genetically                   normal immature embryos.  Specially constructed stocks will be                  used so that the mutant sectors will be marked by a lack of color               (anthocyanin) while the normal tissues will be colored.  If the                 genetically mutant sectors are phenotypically mutant, then the                  expression is cell autonomous, but if the mutant sectors are                    phenotypically normal, then mutant expression is non-autonomous.                                                                                                Similar approaches will be used in studies on dominant mutants                  affecting mature plant traits.  Finally, x-ray induced sectors                  will be used in normal embryos to examine cell lineages and cell                fate in the developing maize embryo.                                                                                                                            The acquisition of the portable x-ray unit would be of                          extraordinary significance for the research.  This is so                        because, instead of having to bring heavy pots containing the                   corn plants with their attached developing ears into a building                 containing an x-ray unit, the mobile unit can be used to                        irradiate ears in the field.  As a result, it will be possible to               increase the scope of this area of research by at least an order                of magnitude.",
