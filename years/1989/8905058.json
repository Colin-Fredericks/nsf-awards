 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Elizabeth Stone and her colleagues will continue their                      archaeological excavation and mapping of Tell Abu Duwari, an                    ancient Mesopotamian site which dates to the second millennium                  B.C.  Unlike most major centers of the time period, this major                  Iraqi site, scattered over 56 hectares, was occupied for only a                 short period of time.  Abu Duwari was apparently destroyed in a                 conflagration and totally abandoned.  Because cultural materials                and architectural remains are covered by only a thin layer of                   sand, large scale horizontal excavation is feasible.  During two                field seasons of work, the team will complete their survey of the               site, surface scrape a large area to gain information on                        residential layout, and conduct intensive excavation in one large               public structure.  Clay tablets will be deciphered and analyses                 conducted on ceramic, floral, and faunal remains.                                                                                                               Although much research has been conducted in the Near east,                     almost nothing is known about city organization.  This is because               excavation has concentrated on deeply stratified temple mounts,                 and the kind of horizontal excavation necessary to reconstruct                  how cities function has not been undertaken.  Tell Abu Duwari was               purposely selected from among a large number of potential sties                 because it offered the possibility to recover such information.                 This research should provide insight into the degree to which                   much authority was centralized.  Dr. Stone suggests that it may                 have been spread across a number of religious and civil                         institutions.  The study will also yield information on the                     degree of status differentiation among inhabitants and the role                 of neighborhoods in social organization and control.                                                                                                            This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of how complex societies, such as our own, first                  emerge and are maintained.  Because it deals with extended                      periods of time, archaeology is in a unique position to                         investigate such long term processes.  Together with information                from other sites, this excavation will contribute to our                        understanding of this phenomenon.",
