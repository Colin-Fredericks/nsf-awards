 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Arthur G. Humes of Boston University proposes                          continuation of his study of the taxonomy and distribution of                   copepods (a common representative of the Crustacea) found in                    deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems in several oceans.  Dr. Humes                has been actively describing representatives of these unusual                   ecosystems since their discovery through the use of submersibles                ten years ago, and he has discovered dozens of new species under                the auspices of an earlier award.                                                    The existence of heretofore unknown species on these                       isolated patches of biological richness in the deep sea raises                  important questions about evolution and biogeography.  Are they                 the survivors of previously widespread species that dwindled and                became isolated, or are they specialized and long-lived                         inhabitants that diverged long ago, or are they recently evolved                and short-lived residents on these ephemeral food-sources?  Can                 they disperse among the distant vents, or do they arrive there                  infrequently and accidentally?  The proposed taxonomic work will                form the foundation for future research projects that explore                   these controversial subjects, and will have impact on a wide                    audience of biologists.",
