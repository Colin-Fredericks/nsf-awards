 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to construct a critically-                verified historical data base of snowfall, snow cover and snow                  water equivalent in the United States for the last 100 years                    using the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) archives.  The                   data base will be used to assess the capabilities of general                    circulation models in the simulation of snow cover and snow-                    climate interactions and assess the utility of using snow records               as indicators of climatic change.  The data base will be                        assembled at NCDC by the principal investigator during the first                year of the project, and analysed in cooperation with modelers                  during the second year.                                                              Snow is a critical element of the climate system.  Climate                 models and empirical studies suggest that snow anomalies are                    associated with synoptic and long-term weather events and may                   play an important role in climate change.  However, there remain                many unanswered questions regarding the variability of snow, the                representativeness of short-term empirical studies and the                      accuracy of the modeling of snow-climate interactions which need                to be addressed with a long-term data base.",
