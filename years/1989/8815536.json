 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Colorado Museum Herbarium contains 435,000               catalogued specimens.  It is the principal state repository of                  botanical specimens and information for Colorado, with                          representation balanced between vascular plants, lichens,                       bryophytes, fungi and algae.  While its emphasis centers on the                 Colorado flora, the geohistorical nature of the phytogeography of               the Rocky Mountain area has required it to reach out and develop                excellence in other areas, particularly the Altai of Middle Asia,               the Caucasus, and Arctic America and Kamtchatka.  The curator's                 field work has made the herbarium a leading international                       repository for lichens and bryophytes, including those of the                   Galapagos Islands, Australia and New Guinea.  The herbarium is                  listed as a National Resource Herbarium by a committee of the                   American Society of Plant Taxonomists.                                               This project provides funds to replace the static-aisle                    arrangement of the herbarium with a mechanically-assisted,                      mobile-aisle compactor system.  Compactors are needed because of                nearly filled cases and storage area.  Over the past forty years,               the herbarium has grown from the original 30,000 specimens at an                average rate of 10,000 new specimens per year.",
