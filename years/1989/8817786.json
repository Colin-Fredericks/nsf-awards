 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aquatic herbivores utilize a food base that can vary widely                in its C:N:P ratio.  The animals adjust their assimilation of N                 and P so that the element in shorter supply is assimilated more                 efficiently.  The hypothesis of this proposal on the                            stoichiometry of grazing, assimilation and release of nutrient                  predicts that grazers make nutrient limitation patterns diverge,                leading their algal prey away from co-limitation by N and P and                 toward limitation by either N or P.  A Mass balance technique                   will allow ingestion, assimilation and re-release of N and P to                 be measured simultaneously for Daphnia faced with different                     concentrations of algae of differing C:N:P.  Determinations of                  tissue C:N:P of Daphnia that have been reared on algae of                       different C:N:P will also be performed.  This project will                      determine the recycling efficiencies of N and P and whether                     nutrient concentration ratios are related to supply ratios, as is               commonly assumed.  Also, it will explore fundamental consequences               of food web dynamics in aquatic ecosystems while providing badly                needed basic data on the N and P physiology of a major aquatic                  organism.",
