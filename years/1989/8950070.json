 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop introduces participants to the basic theoretical                  concepts of computergraphics and solid modeling and provides \"hands.on\"         experience with state.of.the.art graphics systems.  Emphasis is placed          on the integration of these concepts into undergraduate design courses          in aerospace, agricultural, bioengineering, manufacturing, mechanical,          and industrial engineering programs.  This workshop, held for one week          during the summer of 1989, features an extensive follow.up in which             participants will be required to integrate these concepts in an                 undergraduate design courses upon returning to their home institution.          The workshop staff serves as a resource group during the follow.up              activities.  Participant institutions are cost. sharing the                     participants travel expenses to this workshop. Results are to be                published in the journals of the American Society for Engineering               Education.",
