 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with two areas of polymer materials research                (1) phase transitions, morphology, and properties of block                      copolymers; and (2) high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) of               crystalline polymers.                                                                                                                                                The first area involves the detailed study of neat linear                  and star diblock copolymers and block copolymer/homopolymer                     blends as concerns order-disorder transitions and order-order                   transitions.  Emphasis will be placed on understanding the                      molecular parameters which govern phase morphology and stability.               Both small and especially large-strain mechanical behavior of                   these model ordered microcomposites will be examined and related                to the evolution of domain morphology with extent of deformation.                                                                                                    The word in HREM will focus on understanding the details of                chain packing in flexible chain-folded crystals particularly as                 regards regions where the chain arrangement reflects fundamental                information on crystal growth (primary nucleus, twin boundaries,                reentrant growth fronts).                                                                                                                                            The main investigative techniques are transmission electron                microscopy diffraction, small-angle x-ray scattering, digital                   image analysis, computer graphics of surfaces and mechanical                    testing.  The goal of the research is to contribute to the basic                understanding of structure-property relationships which can                     provide a basis for development of materials and improvement of                 their properties.",
