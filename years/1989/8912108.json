 "awd_abstract_narration": "Light is detected by photoreceptor cells in the retina of the                   eye.  Phototransduction is the process of converting the light                  energy into a neural signal for relay to the brain, and generally               depends on activation of a phosphate-containing compound as an                  agent to trigger release of intracellular calcium; the free                     calcium in turn triggers changes in the membrane to initiate the                neural signal.  Biochemical mechanisms in the photoreceptors                    initiate and control light adaptation, which is necessary to keep               the eye sensitive over a huge range of light intensities, from                  darkest night to brightest day.  Recently some invertebrate eyes                have been found to utilize phosphate compounds incorporating the                inositol molecule, rather than the guanine molecule as in the                   vertebrate eye, and these inositol phosphates have been                         implicated in light adaptation.  This project will use squid for                a model invertebrate eye providing abundant material for                        biochemistry.  The aims are to measure the spectral sensitivity                 and determine the rate and formation ratios of the inositol                     phosphates; to identify the subcellular location of the precursor               molecules; and to study enzymes related to activity of these                    inositol compounds and calcium release, particularly protein                    kinase C that is important in many cellular activities.  Results                will be very important for visual physiology, other sensory                     transduction systems, and for other aspects of cell biology                     related to intracellular signalling.",
