 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will focus on mechanisms of soil                     organic carbon and nitrogen dynamics in agroecosystems in the                   warm, humid southeastern U.S. where highly weathered Ultisols                   present unique problems for soil organic matter (SOM) management.               Studies of OM dynamics in Piedmont soils have shown rapid losses                of SOM under conventional cultivation and reduced or even                       reversed SOM losses under conservation management.  These                       patterns appear to vary with soil texture, landscape position and               management practices.  The investigators hypothesize that the                   activities of soil biota are important in regulating the turnover               and stabilization of SOM through their effects on water-stable                  aggregates.                                                                          The objectives are to investigate the regulatory role of                   plant roots, saprophytic fungi, microarthropods and earthworms on               turnover and stabilization of C and N in water-stable soil                      aggregates, and on transformations of C and N from plant litter                 to soil pools and plant biomass in SOM aggrading and degrading                  ecosystems.  Specifically, the project will quantify the effects                of each biotic manipulation on: 1) particulate OM decomposition                 and biotic abundances 2) aggregate formation and stabilization 3)               aggregate associated and bulk soil pools of particulate, active-                unprotected, active-protected, passive and soil solution organic                C and N and 4) transfer rates between pools using C-13 and N-15                 tracers.                                                                             The investigators have been very productive on their                       previous grants and institutional support and facilities are                    more than adequate for running the project.",
