 "awd_abstract_narration": "A family H of Hermitian matrices is efficiently structured                 if it contains members of every order n and the number of                       independent parameters required to specify an arbitrary n x n                   member of H is O(n).  Hermitian Toeplitz matrices and real                      Hankel matrices, for which the element in the i-th row and j-th                 column depends only on i-j or i+j, respectively, are                            efficiently structured.  Matrices of the form A+B, where A is a                 Hermitian Toeplitz matrix and B is a real Hankel matrix, are                    also efficiently structured, as are Hermitian matrices of a                     given displacement rank, i.e. Hermitian matrices which can be                   written as the sum of a fixed number of products of upper and                   lower triangular Toeplitz matrices.  There are two interesting                  spectral problems for efficiently structured matrices:  (a) the                 ordinary eigenvalue problem; i.e., finding the eigenvalues and                  eigenvectors of a given efficiently structured matrix by                        methods which take specific advantage of the simple structure,                  and (b)  the inverse eigenvalue problem; finding a matrix in a                  given efficiently structured family which has as its                            eigenvalues a  given set of real numbers.  The objectives of                    the proposed research are to consider these two problems, which                 are both in relatively primitive stages of development.",
