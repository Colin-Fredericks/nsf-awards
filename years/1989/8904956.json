 "awd_abstract_narration": "To provide insight into the substrate specificity, catalytic                    mechanism and structure of trypsin, current methods of molecular                genetics, biochemistry and biophysics will be used to generate                  and analyze mutant trypsins.  Three general approaches are used                 to alter the enzyme: 1) targeted substitutions, 2) region                       specific substitutions and 3) natural adaptation analysis.  In                  each case site-directed mutants of trypsin are generated                        according to structural and/or functional principles.  The                      novel trypsins are then over-expressed in bacteria.  The variant                proteins of interest are isolated, purified and their parameters                compared with the native enzyme.  Selected mutants are then                     chosen for more detailed kinetic, molecular dynamic and                         coordinated three-dimensional structure analysis.  Results from                 the initial modifications will provide a basis for introducing                  future amino aid changes into the enzyme.  Initial experiments                  have been successful in addressing the role of specific amino                   acids in substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism of the               enzyme.  Proposed experiments involve amino acid replacements of                active site residues for studies of the catalytic mechanism,                    substrate binding pocket residues and surface loop residues.                    These studies will contribute to our understanding of                           structure/function relationships in the enzyme trypsin and                      related serine proteases.  In addition, these studies will help                 provide a framework for the de novo design of enzymes.",
