 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polarization pulsations in lasers represent one of the simplest forms           of coupled mode dynamics and have led to the study of increasingly              complex forms of field-atom interactions.  Research under this RUI              grant will conduct detailed experimental studies of a coupled mode              polarization-isotropic standing wave laser in which the two modes have          the same spatial pattern and same frequency and differ only in the              polarization of the electromagnetic fields.  In the absence of                  symmetry breaking, recently developed models predict new types of               behavior (depending on laser parameters) such as: a) bistability                between the two modes; b) pulsations in the total laser intensity; c)           more complex and partially anticorrelated pulsations between the two            modes.  Experiments will be initiated with 3.39 micron He-Ne lasers             and may be extended to 3.51 micron He-Xe lasers.  Measurements will be          made on individual phases, phase differences, individual amplitudes,            and amplitude changes as a function of adjustments in operating                 conditions such as gas pressure, gas mixtures, cavity length, cavity            losses, and excitation.  Using digitized data, the oscillations will            be analyzed to determine whether they occur chaotically or are merely           random.  Theoretical and numerical work, extending or modifying                 existing models to match conditions, will be used for comparisons with          the experimental results and used to predict amplitude and phase                dynamics.",
