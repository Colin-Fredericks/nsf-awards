 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of an earlier project that                       investigated the accumulation of fine-grained sediment on the                   continental shelf near the mouth of the Amazon River.  The                      earliest research proved that sediment was actively                             accumulating, and later research identified the sedimentary                     processes controlling accumulation.  This project will examine                  in detail the operation of the processes and how they affect                    the formation of sedimentary strata.  This new research will be                 done as the Sedimentology and Stratigraphy portion of AmasSeds                  (A Multi-disciplinary Amazon Shelf SEDiment Study), which is a                  cooperative project between US and Brazilian scientists.  The                   project involves collaboration of Physical, Chemical,                           Biological, and Geological Sciences.                                            %%%                                                                                                                                                             The project will examine mechanisms of Holocene strata                          formation over a range of time and vertical-length scales.                      Time scales will be evaluated using several radiochemical                       techniques (Th-234,Pb-210, Cs-137, C-14) and length scales will                 be examined using a range of coring (box cores, kasten cores,                   piston cores, borings) and high-resolution seismic techniques                   (3.5-kHz system, lower-frequency system).  Cooperation with the                 other groups of AmasSeds will provide much information about                    the sedimentary processes controlling strata formation, and the                 resulting stratigraphy will be characterized by a range of                      observational techniques (SEM, optical microscopy, x-                           radiography, seismic stratigraphy).  The research derives                       importance from its evaluation of a major subaqueous delta,                     which is typical of the largest dispersal systems for fluvial                   sediment in the world.  These large systems have a profound                     influence on modern oceans, and have a good potential for                       reaching the geological record.  The study area is the                          continental shelf near the mouth of the Amazon River, where the                 previous research associated with this grant allows                             establishment and testing of advanced hypotheses regarding                      strata formation.",
