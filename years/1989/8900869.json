The ten-week program will emphasize student                         participation in the research activities of faculty affiliated                  with the Center for Research in Learning, Perception, and                       Cognition in the College of Liberal Arts.  Twelve undergraduates                will participate, half from private liberal arts colleges in the                state of Minnesota and half from the University; they will be                   expected to have completed their sophomore or juniors years.                    Students will: (1) assist with faculty member's research                        including opportunities to work as a member of a research team,                 (2) complete an independent research project, the final products                of which will be a written report and a presentation to peers and               participating faculty, and (3) participate in a multi-                          disciplinary seminar.  Seminar activities include presentations                 by program faculty and faculty in related areas campus wide,                    laboratory tours, and lectures on research tools and design.  The               program will therefore include opportunities for the students to                learn specific research methods, to apply these methods in the                  context of their own research, and to examine broad conceptual                  and methodological issues relating to psychology and the                        cognitive sciences.  Participation in social/cultural events as                 well as common housing in a University dorm will help foster a                  strong community of students.",
