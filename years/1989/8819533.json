 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic winter season is a critical period in the life-histories          of much of the pelagic community, and the relation of the pelagic biota         to the winter ice edge is unexplored.  The composition, abundance, and          vertical and horizontal structure of the micronekton and zooplankton            communities in the vicinity of a marginal ice zone was examined during          the austral winter, 1988, using midwater trawling techniques and                vertical net tows.  Sampling was conducted in the upper 1000m of the            water column in the open water, marginal ice zone, and pack-ice                 dominated communities.  In addition, the feeding patterns of all major          species were studied through direct analysis of diet, metabolism of all         species through direct analysis of oxygen consumption rate, and their           proximate and elemental composition.  The resultant data gives a                complete spectrum of response to the winter season and the winter ice           edge, from the physiology and chemical make-up of the individuals to the        vertical and horizontal structure of the zooplankton and micronekton            communities.  This award will allow for the complete analysis of all            data sets.",
