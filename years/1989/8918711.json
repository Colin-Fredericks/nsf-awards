Approximately fifty engineers and biomedical                                                                                                         professionals will listen to presentations and actively                         participate in discussions on the following topics:  the role                   of vascular anatomy in biothermal processes; the effect of                      blood perfusion on heat and mass transfer; local and whole                      body thermal  regulation; tissue behavior and injury during                     freezing and thawing; tissue behavior and injury during                         heating; instrumentation,      measurement, and imaging; and                    applications to hyperthermia,                                                   burns, laser surgery, electro surgery, freezing of tissues,                      hypothermia, and cryosurgery.
