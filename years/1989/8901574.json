Such systems can be                           mathematically represented by differential equations, integral                  equations, partial differential equations or a combination of                   these types of equations.  He will study methods for                            approximating the solution of complex truss type structures                     which contain viscoelastic damping elements that are used to                    stablize the structure and to suppress unwanted vibrations.  He                 will study control and stabilization of a tumbling viscoelastic                 structure under zero gravity and a two arm flexible manipulator                 under one gravity.  He will also study a movable manipulator                    problem.  The methods which will be used include functional                     analysis techniques, numerical methods, Lyapunov theory and                     integral equations techniques.                                                       The results of this research will provide new methods of                   investigation for vibration suppression in mechanical systems.                  They will also provide new methods of analyzing stability                       properties of feedback control systems for flexible mechanical                  systems.",
