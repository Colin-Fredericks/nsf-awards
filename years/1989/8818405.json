 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genome (the total of all genes in an organism) is much more                 variable than was thought a decade or two ago.  This variability                has led to the testing of gene loci to determine those which                    demonstrate a large number of alleles, none of which occur at                   high frequency.  Such loci are used as \"fingerprints\" to                        distinguish individuals from each other and, because of their                   heritability, they are exceptionally useful in determining                      paternity.  Thus, DNA fingerprinting is a relatively new and                    innovative technique that allows for identifications of parentage               with an unprecedented degree of statistical confidence.                                                                                                         Using DNS fingerprinting the investigators will determine                       paternity within captive populations of several species of                      nonhuman primates, and from a zone of hybridization of two                      species of baboons.  The data generated in this study will allow                for more efficient management of primate colonies by avoiding                   inbreeding, and will provide a tool for the investigation of a                  variety of questions relating kinship and selection, kin                        selection, dominance and reproductive success.  The ability to                  identify parentage, especially paternity, is important in the                   management of primate colonies, and in field research on nonhuman               primates.",
