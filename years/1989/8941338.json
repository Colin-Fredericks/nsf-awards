 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues studies on free amino acid transport                     and its role in osmotic regulation.  Phosphorylation is being                   studied as a key regulatory mechanism during salt stress.                       The hypothesis to be tested is that the intracellular levels                    of the readily metabolized amino acid osmolytes appear to be                    controlled by accumulation behind a well regulated metabolic                    blockade to catabolism within the mitochondria rather than by                   an increased rate of synthesis or by an activation of                           \"overproducer genes\" as is seen in some bacteria.                                                                                                               Adaptation to salt stress at the cellular level is a                            complicated biochemical process.  Cells must regulate their                     internal salt concentration and this has serious implications                   for the regulation of cell volume.  This project investigates                   how the levels of free amino acids are involved in this                         process.***//",
