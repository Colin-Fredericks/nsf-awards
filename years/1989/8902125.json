 "awd_abstract_narration": "In solving decisionmaking problems, both human and artificial                   decisionmakers use scales of measurement based on subject                       judgements to choose among alternative courses of action or to                  select optimal strategies.  With this in mind, the investigator                 is attempting to understand in a systematic way the limitations                 that properties of scales of measurement place on the conclusions               one may meaningfully draw using such scales.  He is studying such               limitations for conclusions from the solutions to problems of                   optimization, from averaging or merging techniques to combine                   individual judgements, from relative scores used to choose among                alternative technologies or alternative heuristics, and from                    models used for solving practical problems involving resources                  allocation, communications, transportation, technology                          assessment, etc.  An important aspect of the work concerns the                  implications of these limitations for the use of scales of                      measurement in problem solving by human or artificial problem                   solvers.  The investigator will attempt to develop the theory of                meaningful statements and to study various theoretical questions                about the theory of scales of measurement which underly its use                 in the analysis of practical decisionmaking problems.",
