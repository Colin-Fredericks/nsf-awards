 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Kongki Min,                          Department of Physics, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, to                     pursue with Dr. Jong Chan Kim, Department of Physics, Seoul                     National University, for 24 months, a program of cooperative                    research in medium energy nuclear physics.  The scientists and                  members of their research groups will collaborate in a study of                                                      +                                          spin-isospin excitations in (gamma,pi ) reactions, using                        monoenergetic photons.  The investigation is directed at                        obtaining nuclear structure information especially related to                   the spin and isospin quantum numbers in the nuclear excitation                  modes.  Previous studies have made use of a photon source with                  a continuous energy distribution, which has introduced rather                   large uncertainties in the determination of cross sections for                  the reactions studied.  By using high energy monochromatic                      photons (gamma rays), the determination of cross sections                       becomes more direct and less dependent on theoretical models.                   At present, there is no operating monochromatic photon facility                 in the United States with the high energy needed for photopion                  experiments.  The collaborators, therefore, will perform their                  experiments at the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory at the                   University of Saskatchewan, Canada.                                                                                                                             The proposed research should provide unique information on the                  basic excitation modes of atomic nuclei and should contribute                   to the understanding of nuclear structure.  The U.S. and Korean                 collaborators are highly respected scientists who have records                  of successful research in electro- and photonuclear physics                     research.  The present project will allow them to combine their                 talents and interests for mutual benefit.  This project is                      relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative                        Science Program which seeks to increase the level of                            cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers                    through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills,                  and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                  benefit.  Korean participation in the project is supported by                   the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
