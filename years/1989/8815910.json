 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Stephen              Harvey, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Dr. Richard                    Lavery, Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, Paris, France.  The              objective of the project is to study the nucleic acid double helix              structure in terms of its primary base sequence.                                                                                                                JUMNA (Junction Modeling of Nucleic Acids), a program developed by              Dr. Lavery and his collaborators, is to be used to model various                DNA structures.  The program will also be modified to convert it                from a structure optimization algorithm to a molecular dynamics                 algorithm.  With regard to DNA structure, two classes of problems               will be investigated.  First, the relationship between DNA sequence             and the variations in the local structure of the double helix will              be examined, with the goal of understanding (1) the origins of DNA              bending and (2) how proteins might recognize DNA sequences through              subtle changes in structure.  Second, models will be built for                  structures associated with polypurine-polypyrimidine sequences and              with replication and transcription.  Among the model structural                 elements will be stem-loop structures, single strands, helices                  containing two, three, and four strands, and the junctions between              these various elements.  These studies will be significant not only             for the insights they provide into DNA structure, but because the               methods developed will be useful for examining other modeling                   problems for both DNAs and RNAs.  With the experience gained from               these studies, the investigators will then turn to the problem of               converting JUMNA into an algorithm for molecular dynamics                       simulations on nucleic acids.  This latter project, if successful,              would allow simulations to be performed on much larger systems and              over much longer time scales than is possible with current                      molecular dynamics algorithms.  The research groups headed by both              Dr. Harvey and Dr. Lavery have made important contributions in the              area of simulation of nucleic acids.  Progress in simulation                    methods has been much slower for NAs than for proteins.  The work               done by these two groups is unique and an important contribution.               The proposed collaboration is expected to accelerate progress in                this field.",
