 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Xinjiang Magnetotelluric Transect\" between Dr.                Stanley H. Ward of the University of Utah and Professor Zhao                    Jingxiang of the Institute of Geophysical and Geochemical                       Exploration is jointly sponsored by NSF and the Chinese Ministry                of Geology.                                                                                                                                                     The investigators propose a magnetotelluric (MT) geophysical                    survey of a portion of China's Xinjiang Province, the first look                at the geoelectric structure of the area directly north of the                  Tibetan Plateau.  The survey will explore a north-south 1000 km                 line of MT stations (transect) running from the Junggar Basin in                the north, across the Tien Shan Range, into the Tarim Basin in                  the south.  The MT method is a passive, deep-sounding                           exploration method used to map variations in the electrical                     conductivity of the subsurface.  The investigators believe MT is                ideally suited for largely unexplored areas such as Xinjiang.                   The completion of this transect will augment other MT surveys                   that have been conducted in China.  These data should be                        comparable to data on the Sevier orogenic belt of Nevada and                    Utah and the Laramide deformation of the Colorado Plateau where                 compressional tectonic forces similar to those at work in                       Central Asia were at work in the late mezozoic and early                        cenozoic.  Using the results of transects such as these, it is                  possible not only to examine crustal structure, but also to                     recognize zones of conductive volatile fluids or partial melting                at depth.  Recognition of such zones is necessary for a complete                understanding of crustal evolution.",
