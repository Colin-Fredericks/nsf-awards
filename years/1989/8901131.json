The                                                                                                 award is for the study of a comprehensive data set involving                    incoherent scatter radars and optical interferometers in order                  to  investigate the changes in global thermospheric circulation                 from one solstice (June) to another (December).  These changes                  have                                                                            important implications for seasonal changes of temperature and                  composition of the thermosphere.  The PI has led the analysis                   of the campaign activity as a Visiting Scientist at NCAR                        (National                                                                       Center for Atmospheric Research).  This award will allow the                    continuation of his effort at the University of Lowell.  This                   study has become a show case for a new philosophy in the                        iterative process of developing models and geophysical                          understanding hand-in-hand.  Much of the work has been driven                   by                                                                              the TGCM (Thermosphere Global Circulation Model) modelling                      effort, both in developing the model and understanding the                      features in the data. This continued work will study selected                   campaign intervals to verify the NCAR-TCGM model using                          temperature and density data, analyze the TCGM simulations to                   investigate wind, temperature and density features observed                     during the selected periods, and simulate the properties of the                 thermosphere for a specific period.                                             7/11/89",
