 "awd_abstract_narration": "A general model of coping with threatening                                      events, the person-event model, is used to                                      generate predictions concerning the impact of                                   a particular type of communication, the                                         negative threat appeal, on earthquake                                           preparedness.  Previous research suggests                                       that exposure to this type of communication                                     can increase level of earthquake                                                preparedness.  Using the person-event model                                     as a theoretical framework, the proposed                                        research extends these findings by                                              determining which combinations of levels of                                     the variables typically included in the                                         content of negative threat appeals are most                                     effective in increasing earthquake                                              preparedness.                                                                   Three studies using experimental methods are                                    planned.  The first two studies will be                                         conducted in a laboratory setting with                                          student populations while the third study                                       will be conducted in a field setting with a                                     homeowner population.",
