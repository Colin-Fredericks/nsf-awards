The Oceanography Society is the first          U.S. professional society devoted exclusively to ocean sciences and             covering all disciplines within this field.  The Society's first meeting        will provide a unique opportunity for students entering the field to            become involved in activities of the Society and to provide input to the        Society's planning of activities relevant to the needs of students.  The        deans' meeting will provide an opportunity for senior administrators            within the U.S. ocean science community to provide guidance from the            prospective of the major ocean science institutions to professional             activities relevant to these institutions' needs.  Lastly, the Society          will begin preparations for publication of a series of booklets to              provide career guidance for those entering ocean sciences.",
