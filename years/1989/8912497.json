 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic Peninsula supports the most abundant and diverse                  populations of plants and animals on the continent.  The grounding of           the supply ship Bahia Paraiso and subsequent oil spill near the U.S.            Palmer Station significantly impacted the area.  Initial observations           have revealed that the oil has coated macroalgae and invertebrates              living on the hard substrata along intertidal cobble beaches and in             tidal pools.  Many of the invertebrates, which form the base of the             Antarctic food web, have been killed.  The oil has also affected seals          and birds.  Some of the oiled birds have died and others have shown             symptoms of starvation, adverse behavior and loss of insulation.  This          research project is part of an integrated, time-series survey of the            marine environment in the vicinity of the oil spill.  The research              groups will examine the spatial and temporal extent of the oil                  contamination and the associated effects on marine flora and fauna.             This project forms the hydrocarbon chemistry portion of the effort; it          will involve the collection and subsequent analysis of plant and animal         tissue, water and sediment samples collected in the affected and in             control areas.",
