 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is the continuation of a long range program               aimed at understanding the structure, properties and metabolic                  activities of the aqueous compartments of animal cells:                         nucleoplasm, interiors of cytoplasmic membrane-bound organelles,                and the cytosol, or aqueous cytoplasm.  Although these                          compartments make up about 75% of the mass and volume of most                   cells, and are the sites of much metabolic activity, very little                is known about the details of their properties and organization.                Current work focuses on the aqueous cytoplasm, and employs                      chiefly cultured mouse fibroblasts (L cells) which have been                    permeabilized with dextran sulfate (DSP cells).  They retain most               macromolecules that are released into the medium by harsher                     treatments (detergent extraction or homogenization):  those                     macromolecules commonly thought to be freely dissolved                          (\"soluble\") in the aqueous cytoplasm.  Retention of most of these               macromolecules in DSP cells occurs in spite of lesions (\"pores\")                in their plasma membranes that are large enough to allow them to                escape.  This research is designed to test the hypothesis that                  most \"soluble\" macromolecules defined by extraction and classical               cell fractionation are not actually free in intact cells but are                instead organized, and associated loosely with the cytomatrix.                  The hypothesis will be tested in DSP cells by an examination of                 the enzymes of glycolysis (long believed to be \"soluble\") using a               variety of metabolic probes and high voltage electron microscopy.  The          efflux of these enzymes (and proteins in general) from DSP                      cells exposed to treatments designed to perturb postulated                      cytomatrix-enzyme associations will be studied by electrophoretic               and enzyme activity assays.  Studies on DS permeabilization of                  other cell types will also be initiated.                                                                                                                        Although little is known about the organization of the cytoplasm                of living cells at the macromolecular level, it has long been                   overlooked as a subject of rigorous study because \"cytoplasm\" has               generally been regarded as a simple solution of proteins and                    small molecules.  Several lines of recent evidence from cell                    biology and biochemistry suggest that this is an oversimplified                 and misleading view of the cell.  The proposed research will                    provide much needed data on the state of organization of proteins               and small molecules in cells and could lead to a fundamentally                  different and more realistic concept of cellular structure and                  function.",
