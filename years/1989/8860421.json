 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science                          Foundation's (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)                    program, which is designed to provide an opportunity for small                  business, particularly the small high technology firm, to                       participate in NSF research.  Phase I of the SBIR program serves                as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the                  firm can do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal                   research project.  Phase III is the conversion of the NSF-funded                research into commercial applications and technological                         innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or                    other non-federal financing.                                                         This is a Phase I project to conduct research in a new error               correction coding technique based on an extension of majority                   logic coding.  The code has an algebraic structure that permits a               hybrid code design that employs cyclic coding in a natural                      fashion withn the basic code.  The resulting hybrid code has                    increased random error correction capability while retaining the                simple iterative scheme, wherin the number of errors is reduced                 significantly with each iteration.  The research will extend                    binary projection code theory to non-binary elements (symbols)                  and investigate the performance of these non-binary projection                  codes.  Erasure decoding of both binary and nonbinary projection                codes will also be investigated.                                                     A successful effort could lead to a relatively inexpensive                 codec capable of efficient operation at high code rates and very                high bit rates.  Numerous commercial and government applications                exist, including broadband ISDN, packet data switching and                      satellite and meteor burst transmission systems.",
