 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the feasibility of using parallel link                 manipulators for high speed, high precision six axis positioning                applications such as mirror pointing, surface finishing,                        machining, and robotic manipulation.  A first phase research                    effort has successfully demonstrated that the Stewart Platform                  type of parallel link manipulator is feasible and has significant               advantages over conventional serial link mechanisms.  The current               phase of research, comprising seven tasks, addresses the building               of a prototype machine tool for finishing operations on aircraft                turbine engine blades.  The first research task evaluates the                   benefits of the \"moving bearing point\" platform design and                      determines whether it or the conventional platform concept should               be adopted for further study.  The \"moving bearing point\" design                is one in which  the actuator supplying force does not move as                  the platform moves.  Task two involves building a functioning                   machine capable of performing the operations required for jet                   engine blade finishing.  Task three calls for implementing the                  feedforward controller developed in the first phase of research.                Task four focuses on experimentally measuring system performance                and optimizing the controller design.  Task five activity will                  test the system developed in the previous tasks and assess its                  ability to perform the finishing operations on aircraft turbine                 engine blades.  Task six extends the system testing to other                    types of parts.  Task seven examines another platform                           modification which involves the use of piezoelectric elements to                achieve high precision, high frequency motion.                                                                                                                  The intent is to follow up phase two work with a phase three                    effort oriented toward producing commercial versions of the                     system developed in phase two.  The impact of this work will be                 on the machine tool industry where innovative concepts which can                reduce costs and improve quality are clearly needed.",
