 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental studies of nematic liquid crystals confined to micron               and submicron-size cavities in a solid polymer are described.                   The high surface-to-volume ratio imposed by the cavities and the                high density of cavities present in polymer dispersed liquid                    crystals (PDLCs) allow for NMR and light scattering studies of                  unusual surface phenomena not possible before by these powerful                 experimental methods.  Unique measurements of surface anchoring                 energies, angles, and residing times are proposed and experiments               on the surface layer transition predicted by theory are shown to                be accessible by these techniques.  Nematic director                            configurations and modifications of the nematic-isotropic                       transition induced by the confinement of a nematic liquid crystal               to a small and highly curved cavity will be studied.  These basic               studies are guided by applications of PDLCs in light shutters for               displays and other electrooptic devices.  Other basic work to                   investigate phase separation in the nematic phase essential to                  create new types of PDLC materials and to determine the                         underlying reason for field induced hysteresis of nematic                       configurations are topics which come from direct interactions                   with applied and industrial interests in PDLC materials.",
