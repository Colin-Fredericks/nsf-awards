 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor David W. Pratt of the University of               Pittsburgh to pursue research collaboratively with Dr. W. L. Meerts             of the Physics Department of the Catholic University of Nijmegen.               They are carrying out ultra high-resolution laser experiments to                examine a variety of dynamical phenomena occurring in the                       electronically excited states of large molecules, including                     benzophenone, napthalene, quinoline, pyrimidine, pyrazine, methyl               salicylate and several organic molecule/rare gas solvent clusters.              The phenomena under study include intramolecular vibrational                    relaxation, internal conversion, intersystem crossing, cluster                  formation, and chemical reactions.  Their experiments will utilize              state-of-the-art continuous wave dye lasers operating in the                    ultraviolet, molecular beams, and on-line data acquisition systems.             The U.S. and Dutch groups bring complementary expertise and                     approaches in high resolution spectroscopy and chemical dynamics to             this joint research.  Although they now have similar equipment, the             Dutch group is the acknowledged leader in this area of molecular                spectroscopy.  Their prior collaboration made possible the design and           fabrication of a new generation of \"laser spectrograph\" at the                  University of Pittsburgh.                                                                                                                                       The absorption of light by a molecule creates an electronically                 excited state.  It is the properties of this state, rather than the             ground state, that dictate the chemical and physical behavior of the            system.  The sophisticated techniques being used in this                        collaborative research will reveal molecular eigenstate structures of           several compounds of biological and chemical interest for the first             time.  This knowledge will make it possible to control chemical bond            breaking and forming mechanisms, and thus permit the control of                 chemical reactions with light.",
