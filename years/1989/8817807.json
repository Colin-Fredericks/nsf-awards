 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Dr. John S. Pearse of the University of                 California, Santa Cruz, to collaborate with Profs. Masashi Yamaguchi            and Kiyoshi Yamazato of the University of the Ryukus, Okinawa, and              Naomasa Kobayashi, of Doshisha University, Kyoto, for six months                beginning in March, 1989.  They will study the development of two               tropical Indo-West Pacific species of sea urchins of the genus                  Diadema.  In order to study the monthly gametogenic rhythms and how             these rhythms are related to moonlight and tidal cycles, and how                these rhythms affect fertility of these species, the researchers will           1) determine the monthly gametogenic rhythms of the species at                  different locations; 2) monitor populations to detect spawning                  events; 3) maintain animals in artificially illuminated laboratory              conditions to simulate moonlight cycles and 4) attempt to rear the              larvae of both species and, if possible, hybrids, through metamor-              phosis.                                                                                                                                                         This cooperative project will provide Dr. Pearse with access to                 Japanese components of widespread and ecologically important members            of the tropical shallow-water fauna, as well as to support from                 Japanese laboratories and researchers with experience in raising and            studying these species.  Since these sea urchins are prevalent, cause           bioerosion, and create a nuisance for fishermen and swimmers, further           understanding of their reproductive patterns                                    may have important ecological effects.",
