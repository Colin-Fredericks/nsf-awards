 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Catalogue of the Miridae of the World, now 34 years old,               is the basic reference for students of the plant bugs.  It brings               together in one place all of the information on the                             classification and distribution of the 10,000 or so members of                  this group of true bugs.  Because of its age, it does not reflect               the many changes in the classification of the group presented in                the literature in the last three decades, nor information on the                many new species described.  Thus, the preparation of a                         supplement is the most efficient way to bring this invaluable                   resource up to date.  Over the past 15 years the principal                      investigator has amassed the bibliographic resources necessary                  for preparation of the supplement, and has laid much of the                     ground work toward its completion.  The final volume will allow                 access to all literature on the classification of the group,                    present lists of hosts by predator and host, and--having been                   prepared using a computer database--can be updated on a periodic                basis as well as queried in order to answer more complex                        questions than would be possible with the printed version of the                catalog.                                                                             This project provides funding for preparation of the                       supplement, which will be useful to systematists, ecologists,                   agriculturists and insect pest-control specialists.",
