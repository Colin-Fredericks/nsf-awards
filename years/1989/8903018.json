 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues work on the mathematical theory of                  functional differential equations.  Of particular interest are                  those equations involving time delay and the presence of a                      negative feed-back condition.  Singular perturbation methods will               be employed.  Equations of this type arise in a number of                       applications such as optics, physiology and mathematical biology.                    Considerable progress has been made on these equations.                    Emphasis will be placed on understanding the dynamics of                        solutions having prescribed values given over an interval.  A                   particular instance would be to give conditions for the existence               of slowly varying solutions.  Other work will focus on equations                where one has state dependent time lags which model blood                       cell production and agricultural commodity cycles.  Here again,                 one looks for periodicity properties of solutions as well as                    insight into the asymptotic properties of solutions as the                      perturbation parameter tends to zero.                                                Another class of problems to be considered involves                        functional differential equations where the forcing functional                  depends on the delayed values of the solution as well as the                    current values. Here the primary object is to determine if there                are no nonconstant solutions of period equal to four.  Examples                 indicate that this conjecture is true, although its validity is                 by no means assured.",
