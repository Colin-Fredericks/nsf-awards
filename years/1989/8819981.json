 "awd_abstract_narration": "Considerable evidence now exists that exposure to an intense                    event, such as electric shock, a noise, or even mere physical                   confinement, can elicit a strong form of analgesia in humans and                in animals.  More recently, it has been shown that an initially                 neutral or \"meaningless\" stimulus paired with this event can                    subsequently acquire the ability to produce an analgesia on its                 own.  For example, a tone which has previously been paired with                 an electric shock has been reported to invoke a strong form of                  analgesia.                                                                                                                                                      In many situations this analgesia appears to be mediated by the                 release of endorphins, the body's own morphine-like substances.                 In other situations, a different, non-opiate mechanism appears to               be involved.  As a further complication, some investigators have                failed to find either of these forms of conditioned analgesia.                  In fact, some researchers have reported exactly the opposite--                  that this pairing of stimuli leads to an increase (rather than a                decrease) in pain reactivity.                                                                                                                                   In the present set of experiments, Dr. Grau is exploring the                    variables which determine whether analgesia or hyperalgesia is                  produced.  These studies are examining two sets of factors which                influence pain reactivity.  The first is a determination of how                 and when an opioid versus a non-opioid form of analgesia is                     produced.  The second is examining the role of environmental                    factors (such as time of day, testing in the training location                  versus in a novel location, and whether the subjects are tested                 during the dark or the light portion of the light/dark cycle) in                the modulation of algesia.  The results of these experiments are                helping to answer very fundamental questions about the nature of                pain responses, and providing insight into currently existing and               potential pain management regimens.",
