 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synthetic diamond cutters can significantly improve rock drilling               operations under some cutting conditions, but at a critical surface             speed the effectiveness of the drill drops off precipitously.  It is            felt that this phenomena is associated with the decrease in mechanical          strength which accompanies an increase in cutter temperature.  In the           research proposed the temperature near the cutter surface will be               measured when granite cylinders are turned in a lathe using a single            diamond cutter.  Thermocouples mounted in the tool will provide the             temperature as a function of cutting parameters (speed, cooling rate,           flank wear), and will be correlated with force measurements from a 3-D          force dynamometer.  A previously developed finite element code will be          used to interpret the temperature measurements, and the experimental            date will be used to validate the code's predictive ability.                                                                                                    Successful completion of the research plan will permit the design of            field tests, which in turn could lead to a strategy for monitoring and          controlling the down-hole cutter temperature.  This would favorably             impact the drill life while speeding the well drilling operation,               resulting in significant savings for deep oil reservoirs in hostile             locations.",
