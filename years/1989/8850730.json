 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics| is a series of professional quality computer animated              videotapes containing modules on various topics in basic mathematics.           This project will produce six modules on high school geometry for use in                                                                                        classrooms and learning centers.  Each module tape will be about 20             minutes long and will be accompanied by student workbooks and teacher           manuals.  The modules are intended to be easily integrated into current         curricula.                                                                                                                                                      The tapes are designed to encourage interaction between the video tape,         teacher, and students.  This is done by structuring each tape into small                                                                                        capsules, which are identified by number titles keyed to the student            workbooks, permitting the teacher to stop the tape at the end of each           capsule to allow discussion by the students.                                                                                                                    The tapes will be produced by the same team that created the 52 half            hour episodes of \"The Mechanical Universe\" and the twenty minute pilot          tape of \"The Theorem of Pythagoras.\"                                                                                                                            All materials will be distributed on a nonprofit basis through a                consortium of state departments of education, and through workshops and         assistance from the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) and the           National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM).  Field testing,             evaluation, and teacher training is an essential part of the proposal.          High school teachers will be involved at every developmental stage, and         ongoing teacher support will be arranged through the consortium.",
