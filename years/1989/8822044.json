 "awd_abstract_narration": "Input-output analyses of the structure and dynamics of economic            systems recently have entered into a new phase of development, as more          sophisticated modelling techniques have been used to evaluate larger            and more complex data sets.  A particularly promising line of inquiry           has been the development of probabilistic distribution approaches to            provide operational solutions for models.  This project will continue           development of these new probabilistic solution techniques in order to          examine the regional variation in input-output coefficients, which              reflect the ratios of transaction flows to total outputs for different          sectors in specific locales over given time periods.  The main thrust           of the research will be analyses of U.S. national input-output data in          order to refine solution techniques and to estimate probability                 density-derived coefficients of industry sectors for different regions          and for the nation as a whole.  The geographic variation of the                 coefficients will be analyzed to determine patterns of cross-regional           variation and other sources of systematic variation, such as the size           or type of industrial establishment.  Analyses also will be made of the         impacts of differences in regional technological development on                 economic activity.                                                                   By exploring new techniques of input-output analyses on a                  previously untapped set of national industrial data, this project will          be valuable from theoretical, methodological, and empirical                     perspectives.  The enhancement of techniques based on probabilistic             distributions will further general understandings of the utility of             these types of techniques in comparison with more conventional forms of         stochastic model solution procedures.  Methodological developments will         provide a foundation for future work on data sets for all scales,               locations, and time periods, and the outcome of these tests should              contribute new knowledge about the changing regional composition of the         contemporary American economy.",
