To achieve its goal, NISEE maintains                                   a comprehensive, specialized resource data                                      base which is used by public and private                                        individuals and organizations worldwide.                                        There are presently two branches of NISEE; one                                  located at U. C. Berkeley, and one located at                                   Caltech.  In addition to its national role,                                     the Caltech Branch provides an easily                                           accessible resource for the large and active                                    community of earthquake engineering and                                         seismic safety related specialists in the                                       Southern California region.  During the next                                    period of operation, the Caltech Branch will                                    maintain and upgrade the current general                                        resource data base and will work to increase                                    its accessibility to the user community.  In                                    addition, the Branch will undertake a major                                     new initiative in the important area of                                         earthquake strong ground motion.  A special                                     resource base will be established to meet the                                   increased strong-motion data needs of                                           individuals in such fields as risk assessment,                                  structural performance analysis, and code                                       development.",
