 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been a florescence in ethnographic research                      methodologies, based on the development of computer programs for                enhanced ethnographic data collection, storage, retrieval, and                  analysis.  This project integrates these innovations into the                   curriculum through the creation of a six work station                           ethnographic data processing laboratory.                                                                                                                             The laboratory becomes a center piece for an expanded                      science training program in cultural anthropology at NAU.  The                  undergraduate program is focused in two directions.  One is the                 traditional undergraduate curriculum.  The other is a new                       emphasis on minority undergraduate science education.  In line                  with the latter, the U.S. Department of Education has awarded a                 grant to bring in 20 minority undergraduate students for a summer               field research program at Wupatki National Monument.  The project               focus for this grant is to provide training for the minority                    students in the context of an ethnographic assessment of visitor                behavior at Wupatki National Monument (29 miles from Flagstaff).                The project melds computer assisted cognitive anthropology data                 collection, with ethnographic participant observation of                        procedures, to determine the expectations and the preferences of                visitors, and provides policy information about historic                        preservation to the National Park Service.  This project will                   continue for at least five years.                                                                                                                                    The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal                    amount of funds.",
