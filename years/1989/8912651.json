 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic Peninsula supports the most abundant and diverse                  populations of plants and animals on the continent.  The grounding              of the supply ship Bahia Paraiso and subsequent oil spill near the              U.S. Palmer Station significantly impacted the area.  Initial                   observations have revealed that the oil has coated macroalgae and               invertebrates living on the hard substrata along intertidal cobble              beaches and in tidal pools.  Many of the invertebrates, which form              the base of the Antarctica food web, have been killed.  The oil                 has also affected seals and birds.  Some of the oiled birds have                died and others have shown symptoms of starvation, adverse                      behavior and loss of insulation.  This research project is part of              an integrated, time-series survey of the marine environment in the              vicinity of the oil spill.  The research groups will examine the                spatial and temporal extent of the oil contamination and the                    associated effects on marine flora and fauna.  This project will                focus on the fish community, with an examination of the                         reproductive physiology and feeding ecology of fish in control and              affected areas.",
