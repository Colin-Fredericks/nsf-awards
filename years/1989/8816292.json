 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine anthropogenic                     pollution indicators as well as biological marker compounds in                  antarctic sediments by characterizing organic compounds present in              trap particulates, surface sediments, and sediment cores.  These                will be related to their probable sources, such as aeolian                      transport, marine productivity, human activities, etc.  The                     project will initially concentrate on lipid components.  Lipids                 are modified within the water column, with further digenetic                    changes occurring after incorporation into the sediment.  In the                antarctic environment this process should stand out because of                  abundant marine productivity and negligible higher plant debris,                and may show evidence of the influence of human activities and the              influx of global pollution.  A detailed organic geochemical                     analysis of free and bound lipids from sediments and particulates,              and total lipids from potential biogenic material, will be carried              out to characterize sources, estimate fluxes, and study the                     digenesis of organic compounds.  The result will be a better                    understanding of paleo-oceanographic conditions and biogeochemical              processes of the region, as well as a more definitive                           identification of chemical tracers of global pollution.",
