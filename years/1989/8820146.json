The                   interferometric data successfully recorded on 2-14 October 1987                 consist primarily of observations of two radio sources:  3C279                  and 3C273B, the former occulted by the Sun on October and the                   latter serving as a reference object.  Signals were recorded in                 three widely-separated radio-frequency bands:  2, 8, and 23 GHz.                Such frequency coverage will allow them to use the known                        dispersion relation for radio waves in the coronal and                          ionospheric plasmas to remove most of their effects from the                    observations.  Auxiliary data will be used to account for the                   effects of the variations in Earth orientation, the brightness                  distributions of the two sources, and the Earth's neutral                       atmosphere.  They expect to determine the deflection with a                     standard error of one part in 103 (i.e., to determine the                       parameter   of the parameterized-post-Newtonian formalism to two                parts in 103).",
