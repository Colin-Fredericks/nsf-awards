 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of chemical signals (trail pheromones) to coordinate                    food-finding activity has been well documented among the social                 insects, notably the ants and termites.  Studies now indicate                   that some species of gregarious caterpillars also use trail                     pheromones to communicate.  Very little is known of the                         significance of communication among caterpillars, and only a                    single larval trail pheromone has been previously identified.                                                                                                   This collaborative study will enhance our knowledge of chemical                 communication in caterpillars by focusing on both the chemical                  and behavioral bases of exploratory and recruitment trail-marking               in the eastern tent caterpillars.  Drs. Fitzgerald and Webster                  will investigate the behavioral mechanisms that underlie trail-                 marking and trail-selection behavior, and will  attempt to                      identify and synthesize the specific chemical compounds that are                used in communication.  To the extent that it is successful, this               study will be the first to determine the chemical and behavioral                bases of bilevel system of trail-based communication.                                                                                                           The tent caterpillar was selected for study because it is thought               to utilize one of the most elaborate systems of trail-based                     chemical communication found among caterpillars.  In addition,                  tent caterpillars, collectively, are among the most economically                important of leaf-feeding insects, causing significant damages to               forest and shade trees throughout the Northern Hemisphere.                      Present knowledge of these insects is too superficial to assess                 the potential role of larval pheromones in ecologically-sound                   programs of pest management, but the basic chemical and                         behavioral studies that Drs. Fitzgerald and Webster will conduct                will provide necessary background information for exploring this                possibility.",
