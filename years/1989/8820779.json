 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electronic band structure of thin film overlayers can be                    altered by changing the crystal structure and lattice                           parameters.  The correlation between crystal and band structures                will be investigated by combining the powerful surface science                  techniques of angle-resolved photoemission and low energy                       electron diffraction (LEED).  Overlayers will be forced into                    unusual crystal geometries and lattice spacings by epitaxially                  growing the overlayer on carefully chosen crystal substrates.                   The investigation will concentrate on selected overlayer                        materials chosen from the IIa and IIb elements and the noble                    gases.  The band structure of the overlayers can be investigated                by using photoemission to determine the binding energies of the                 valence bands as a function of the position in the Brillouin                    zone.  This traditional technique of determining band structure                 will be complemented by a new method that consists in analyzing                 the relative photo-ionization partial cross-section of valence                  orbitals as a function of photon energy.  LEED will be used to                  investigate the overlayer crystal lattice structure by comparing                LEED intensity versus electron accelerating voltages with                       dynamical LEED calculations.  By combining the two techniques of                photoemission and atom beam scattering in the investigation of                  thin (0-10) monolayer films, insight into the importance of                     atomic orbital overlap and many electron effects upon electronic                band structure will be provided.",
