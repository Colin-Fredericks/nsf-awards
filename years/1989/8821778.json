 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the work of Dr.                     Margaret Etter.  Etter, a professor of chemistry at the                         University of Minnesota, is investigating how small molecules                   naturally organize themselves to form larger complexes.  These                  newly organized aggregates have the unique ability to trap                      smaller molecules.  This exciting area of chemistry is                          sometimes known as \"host-guest\" chemistry in recognition of the                 unique ability of the large complexes  (hosts) to trap the                      smaller \"guest\" molecules, and is paving the way for the design                 of molecules that can mimic the biological catalysts, enzymes.                                                                                                  The work involves the modelling, preparation, and                               characterization of hydrogen-bonded host-guest structures                       called cyclamers.  These aggregates are formed from                             self-assembling smaller units through preferred hydrogen                        bonding interactions.  Extensive molecular modelling to predict                 cavity sizes will be experimentally tested by examining the                     size of the guest molecules that the hosts can trap.  Because                   of the hydrogen-bonded interactions in the host-guest                           relationship, the specificity expected should rival that from                   sigma-bonded macrocycles.",
