 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are to obtain a picture of a protein                  and its solvent environment at atomic resolution and to test how                well the mobility of atoms in the structure is modeled by                       molecular dynamics and normal mode treatments of protein motion.                The test system for these studies is the well-ordered,                          hydrophobic protein, crambin, which diffracts to at least 0.83 A.               An underlying motivation is to understand the forces which                      stabilize protein folding by determination of the protein's                     equilibrium geometry and vibrational motion and by calculating                  the magnitude of the interaction forces in the crystal with an                  empirical potential energy function.                                                                                                                            Crambin presents a unique opportunity to view a protein with its                surrounding solvent at truly atomic resolution, unprejudiced by a               restraining protein model.  There are numerous benefits from                    this information.  The geometry of the peptide unit can be seen                 for the protein itself.  The hydrogen bonding distances and                     angular distributions both within the protein and for the water                 can be examined.  The arrangement of water molecules around polar               and nonpolar groups at the protein surface may provide a model                  for building water around other protein surfaces and for                        understanding water at the active sites of enzymes.",
