BCST is the principal vehicle of the National                       Research Council for addressing issues specific to biochemistry,                chemistry, chemical engineering, and related disciplines.  Chaired              by Drs. George M. Whitesides and Edward A. Mason, with twenty-one               members broadly knowledgeable in chemistry, chemical engineering,               related sciences, and the administration of research in academic,               industrial, and government laboratories, BCST organizes and                     provides oversight to a number of important study committees.                   These activities produce reports of considerable importance to the              Foundation and which are made available to the public without                   restriction.",
