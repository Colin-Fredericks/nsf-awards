 "awd_abstract_narration": "The location of industrial operations in the United States has             changed dramatically since the end of World War II.  Recent studies by          geographers, economists, and other scholars have found that a large             share of new industrial growth is generated by private firms that               contract with U.S. military services.  These labor-intensive firms have         tended to locate in certain northeastern, southeastern, south central,          and western states.  Although theories have been developed for other            industries to explain the locational patterns of production and                 employment, rigorous testing of locational hypotheses regarding                 defense-related industries has not been done on a national scale.  As a         result, relatively little is specifically known regarding the long-term         relationship of defense-related industrial operations, labor pools, and         other factors.  This project will test a set of hypotheses about the            temporal and geographical patterns of defense-related industrial                employment in order to determine the degree to which defense-industry           workers follow jobs rather than vice versa.  Data from the Bureau of            Labor Statistics, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, and            other sources will be analyzed to explore (1) the magnitude and                 occupational composition of defense-related employment, (2) changes in          occupational orientation to defense, (3) regional patterns of                   occupation by different industries, (4) migration of workers in                 defense-related industries and occupations, (5) changes in the                  locational patterns of different occupational classes, and (6) the              socio-economic composition and earnings of defense-related workers.  In         addition to determining the ways in which workers have migrated to              regions of net increase in defense-related industrial employment, this          project will identify how workers respond when defense-related                  industrial employment declines.                                                      This project will make important contributions to both theoretical         and empirical knowledge.  By rigorously testing an integrated set of            locational hypotheses relating defense-related industrial production            and employment to the occupational composition, mobility, and socio-            economic characteristics of workers, this project will provide a basis          for comparison with other industries that already have undergone                extensive analyses.  General theories of modern industrial and labor            force location therefore will be enhanced.  The conclusions of this             research will also be of considerable interest to persons specifically          interested in the impacts of defense-related industrial activity on the         populations and labor forces of areas where such industries are                 located.  By better understanding the processes of worker response to           industrial activity, policy makers will have more complete knowledge of         the ramifications of decisions to increase or reduce production in this         critical industrial sector.",
