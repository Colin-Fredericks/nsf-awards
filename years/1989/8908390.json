 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the debate surrounding the LDC-debt crisis involves                     asking and answering the question of who will pay for the costs                 associated with settling these debts.  This question can be best                addressed in a context which accounts for the strategic nature of               many of the decisions involved.  The purpose of this project is                 to construct and develop game-theoretic models that will help us                better understand the debt crisis and the impact of various                     proposals designed to deal with it.                                                                                                                             Two areas of research will be addressed:  (1) Sovereign-debt                    renegotiations, and (2) The strategic interactions among debtor                 countries.  The first part will focus on developing models which                recognize that a kind of bargaining game exists between a                       sovereign debtor and a creditor, insofar as the latter cannot                   commit to punishing (or not rewarding) the former unless the                    entire debt is repaid.  These models will shed light on how LDC                 governments' policies may affect the bargaining equilibrium and                 how different proposals impinge upon this equilibrium.  The                     second part of the study will consider how the presence of other                debtor countries affects the bargaining problem between debtor                  and creditor.  In particular, the avenues by which a country's                  bargaining strategy may influence another's will be analyzed as                 well as the scope for collusive behavior among the debtor                       countries.",
