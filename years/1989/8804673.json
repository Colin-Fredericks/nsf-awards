 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the aquisition of a computer and related          hardware and software that will serve the needs of a large,                     interdisciplinary group of investigators at the University of Georgia.          Together with other equipment to be provided by the University, the             computer will allow the investigators to work on a variety of problems          such as enzyme structure and DNA sequence analysis, the latter                  especially as applied to the study of plant gene regulation.  The new           computer will both complement and supplant dated existing equipment             which is both expensive to maintain and inadequate for some tasks               described in the proposal.                                                      The effective use of computers has revolutionized current practice in           many areas of biological science, and has virtually created others.             The three-dimensional analysis of protein structure and the comparative         analysis of DNA sequence data are two good examples of research that            neccesitate extensive use of computation.  The rapidity with which new,         smaller and more powerful computers are being developed means that              equipment purchased as recently as a few years ago may now be obsolete.         Moreover, the development of networking devices means that a single             computer can serve the needs of many users and give occasional users            access to a relatively powerful machine whose purchase they could not           justify individually.",
