 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in atmospheric observing technology                        promise to greatly increase in the number and variety of                        asynoptic observations that are available for numerical weather                 prediction.  These observations will be available at both                       spatial and temporal resolutions that are much higher than                      present data.  Current operational data assimilation systems                    cannot fully utilize the information in these high resolution                   data.  Thus, the development of techniques to extract maximum                   information from these new and diverse data sources and to                      produce the initial fields required for numerical models                        presents a major challenge to the atmospheric sciences                          community.  Such developments also will have an important                       impact on the quality of future research data sets.                                  The goal of this research is to develop for a regional                     model a four-dimensional data assimilation system based on the                  Newtonian relaxation continuous assimilation or \"nudging\"                       technique.  The assimilation package will be developed for                      National Meteorological Center's (NMC) Nested Grid Model (NGM).                 In the course of his research, the principal investigator will                  examine adjustment processes within the model, comparing                        analyses obtained via the nudging technique with those produced                 with the current operational data assimilation system.  The                     GALE (Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiment) data set represents                  an excellent set of observations for this purpose.  The data                    set contains observations at high spatial and temporal                          resolution from observing systems similar to those that will be                 used operationally in the near future.                                               This project is part of a joint program in basic research                  related to numerical weather prediction supported by NMC (NOAA)                 and NSF.",
