 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Tulsa proposes a five-week summer workshop, Physics,          Chemistry, and Environment: A Hands-On Workshop for Elementary School           Teachers, for 25 elementary teachers from rural and gifted/talented             classrooms to be repeated each summer for three years.  The workshop            will select teachers who are not necessarily well-prepared in science           although, because they are teaching either gifted and talented children         or in a rural classroom, they are skillful teachers accustomed to               individualizing the curriculum through working with students of varying         abilities and grade levels.                                                                                                                                     The Workshop will strengthen teachers' knowledge of basic physics and           chemistry by presenting concepts as they are manifested in the                  Geosphere/Biosphere.  It will also promote teachers' ability to do              hands-on experiments with children, and enhance their enjoyment of              science and confidence in teaching it.  The workshop has several                components, namely, (1) activity/discussion sessions on basic physics           and chemistry principles, (2) a practicum involving hands-on experiments        done with children under the supervision of a master teacher, (3) guest         presenters and field trips, (4) discussion of classroom implementation          problems and (5) preparation of an implmentation plan and initial               teaching units.  To maximize the opportunities for classroom impact, the        workshop will incorporate participation by administrators,                      provide equipment for each teacher to take back to his or her                   home classroom, funded by the local schools, and a vigorous                     follow-up program of communication, consultation and support.                                                                                                   Cost-sharing by the University of Tulsa as well as the                          cooperating school districts is equal to 26% of the NSF request.",
