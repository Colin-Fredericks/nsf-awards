 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complex carbohydrates or glycoconjugates are widely distributed                 in nature, mainly as glycoproteins or glycolipids.  The presence                of carbohydrates in proteins may affect their stability, modulate               their biological activity, and control their lifespan in the                    body.  Glycoproteins and glycolipids on cell surfaces confer                    specificity to the cells and play a crucial role in phenomena                   such as the selective binding of hormones, growth factors and                   toxins; the immune response; fertilization, differentiation and                 growth; and the social behavior of cells.  The past decade has                  witnessed an extraordinary burst of activity in glycoconjugate                  research and applications as evidence by doubling of the number                 of publications in this field.  Currently there are over 5000                   publications a year on glycoproteins alone.  Financial support                  for young scientists affords them the opportunity to attend the                 Xth International Symposium on Glycoconjugates and glean                        information on the latest advances made in these areas worldwide.                                                                                               This award funds partial support for postdoctoral fellows and/or                junior scientists to attend a multidisciplinary conference, the                 Xth International Symposium on Glycoconjugates, to be held in                   Jerusalem, September 10-20, 1989.  The purpose of this Symposium                is to present and discuss the major advances in the structural                  and functional studies of glycoproteins and glycolipids, as well                as applications of the recent findings to biology, medicine,                    agriculture and biotechnology.",
