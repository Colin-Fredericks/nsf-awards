 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces undergraduate Computer Science faculty to               parallel computing through a two-week course during the summer.  Those          completing the course are not only prepared to develop an                       undergraduate course on parallel computing, but also to assess the              feasibility of establishing an undergraduate parallel processing                laboratory at their own college and the possibilities for incorporating         aspects of parallel computing into other courses.  The two-week course          includes lectures surveying the broad scope of parallel computing and           instruction on the design and implementation of parallel algorithms.            About half the time of this course is devoted to hands-on programming.          A one-week seminar in January allows participants to present projects           they have developed and used and to discuss the practical aspects of            teaching parallel programming to undergraduates.",
