 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one year, full.time postdoctoral fellowship enables a new                  PhD in Science, Technology and Society, with a masters degree in                computer science, to develop her capabilities for policy analysis               of the implications of new developments in information technology               for civil liberties.  Her research will examine five areas:                     technologies for unique identification, regulation of records                   held by private organizations, FBI National Crime Information                   Center 2000, effects of network security regulations on privacy                 and usability, and mechanisms for using information technology to               strengthen individual privacy and enhance citizen access to                     electronic information.  The project's objectives are to combine                technical and legal perspectives about the impacts of information               technology on civil liberties, and to articulate the options for                and implications of policy decisions in this area.  To gain                     formal training in legal and public policy analysis, this                       investigator will work with a legal scholar who specializes in                  civil liberties, including the implications of computer                         technology for the protection or infringement of personal                       privacy.  Lectures, seminars, tutorials and coursework will                     provide the necessary exposure to theories, methods, and tools to               identify and assess policy options in this area.  This project                  addresses a central issue in technology and public policy:                      ethical and value implications of new developments in information               technology.  The proposed training will augment this                            researcher's ability to undertake research in this area; the                    investigator, host specialist and host institution are very well                qualified to undertake and support the effort; collaborative work               is likely to continue after the award period.  Results are likely               to be appropriately disseminated and useful.  An award in the                   amount of $28,000 is therefore recommended.",
