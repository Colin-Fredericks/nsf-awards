 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the remaining gaps in the quantitative record of U.S.                    economic history is detailed information on the fiscal activities               of state and local governments.  Annual time series on federal                  revenues and expenditures are available from 1789 on, but similar               information on state and local governments is sparse,                           particularly before 1900.  This project closes the statistical                  gap for nineteen western states by developing for each state                    annual time-series estimates of state revenues and expenditures                 and decennial estimates for local revenues and expenditures,                    supplemented by a series on large cities.  These series indicate                overall levels of fiscal activity and the sources and uses of                   funds.  State documents, published and unpublished, furnish the                 basis for complete state level estimates.  Local government                     estimates are based on a sampling procedure.                                                                                                                    This project should be funded because it creates a unique and                   invaluable database for U.S. economic history and public finance.               The first two stages of the work covered states from the Atlantic               seaboard to the Mississippi.  This grant completes the database                 for the entire United States.  The data is publicly available                   through the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social                 Research.  The project also produces a series of papers                         summarizing the fiscal history of states in each region of the                  country and studies on questions of public finance and the role                 of government in the 19th century.",
