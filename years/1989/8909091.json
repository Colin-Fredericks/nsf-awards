 "awd_abstract_narration": "A processor array is a collection of many similar processors, which can         be executed in both parallel and pipline processing.  Very often, spare         processors and switching lattices are incorporated in the array to              improve the (fabrication-time) yield and the (run-time) reliability.            For these schemes, the complexity of the switching lattice can be               characterized by using a parameter, the track-number.  Previously, the          investigator has explored there configurability of one-and-half-track           arrays whose lattices are of minimal complexity.                                                                                                                The research project involves three areas:  (1) Finding switching               lattices which maximize yield/reliability subject to area constraints           (instead of lattices with minimal complexity).  (2) Developing                  switching lattices suitable for enhanced-mesh arrays.  (3) Developing           real-time fault tolerance schemes for synchronous arrays.  The                  difficulty comes from the need to resolve multiple faults in a real             time environment.  A distributed design for asynchronous arrays                 probably may be modified and used in synchronous arrays.",
