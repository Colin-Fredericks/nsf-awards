 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work will continue on research projects involving the                      interplay of mathematical analysis, geometry and algebra.                       Questions arising in conformal and biholomorphic geometry and                   Fuchsian partial differential equations will be the focus of the                research. The first project is a continuing collaboration aimed                 at the construction of all scalar invariants of a conformal or                  Cauchy- Riemann manifold.  A complete solution for odd dimensions               in the conformal case appears to be accessible at this time.  The               problem has been reduced to a purely algebraic problem in                       invariant theory.  A partial solution in even dimensions has also               been found.  The ultimate goal of this work is to give an                       explicit invariant description of the asymptotic expansion of the               Bergman kernel of a smooth bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain                 in complex n-dimensional space.                                                      A related project involves the application of                              representation-theoretic methods to parabolic invariant theory.                 The objective is the same as above except that an alternate                     approach is to be analyzed using Verma modules which have the                   same structure as the space of jets of a conformal structure.  A                formulation of the problem in terms of Verma modules brings more                structure and tools to bear as well as providing a large class of               test problems on which to develop methods.                                           The third project concerns the study of existence,                         uniqueness and regularity of Fuchsian differential equations                    described by Einstein metrics and harmonic maps on conformally                  compact manifolds.  These equations are given by nonlinear                      systems of elliptic type which degenerate at the manifold                       boundary.  As a first goal, work will be done in finding                        conformally compact metrics having constant negative Ricci                      curvature, with the conformal class specified in advance.  This                 would extend the model case of the hyperbolic metric of constant                negative curvature defined on a ball. Here, the conformal class                 is the standard metric of the sphere.//",
