 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project extends earlier contributions to the                  theory of semilinear elliptic partial differential equations.                   Recent research has established that multiple solutions can exist               when the equations are defined on unbounded domains.  One of the                issues to be considered in this project is to clarify the                       conditions one must impose on the equations to guarantee the                    existence  of any solutions.   Simple examples illustrate how an                equation may have only trivial solutions.                                            A second line of investigation will focus on second order                  fully nonlinear elliptic equations.  This is an area of                         considerable activity where existence and uniqueness results have               been established for equations on compact Riemannian manifolds                  with nonnegative sectional curvature.  It is not clear whether                  the nonnegativity is necessary.  Work will be done in an effort                 to explain the role of the sectional curvature and to consider                  the related complex equations as a longer-range goal.",
