 "awd_abstract_narration": "The technique of X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool for                   the determination of the molecular structure of compounds as                    diverse as small polypeptides and complex metal clusters.  When                 combined with the latest computer software, the technique is                    becoming remarkably easy to put into practice.  The acquisition                 of X-ray crystallographic instrumentation markedly improves the                 ability of chemists to carry out frontier research.                                                                                                             This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                      Houston to acquire an X-ray diffractometer.  The areas of                       chemical research that will be enhanced by the acquisition are                  as follows:                                                                                                                                                     1) Structure reactivity relationships for dirhodium complexes                   2) Structural studies of metal-metal and metal-carbon                              metalloporphyrins                                                            3) Charge transfer salts                                                        4) Mechanistic and synthetic studies on biologically relevant                      molecules                                                                    5) Natural products structure                                                   6) Novel ligand systems.",
