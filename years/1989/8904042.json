 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of bimodal volcanism has been a particularly                         persistent problem in igneous petrology.  This project seeks to                 understand the petrologic processes responsible for bimodal                     basalt-rhyolite volcanic suites.  Some petrogenetic studies have                assumed such volcanic suites formed by mechanisms operating in a                single, large, long-lived magma chamber, where complex AFC                      processes are required to explain the compositional variations in               bimodal suites.  Here it is suggested that bimodal suites are                   produced by repeated injection of mafic magma into the crust.                   These small volume bodies cause partial melting of the crust.                   Basalt-rhyolite magmas are generated in a series of small,                      unconnected reservoirs.  Lavas erupted over a large area within a               short time may be related only by their common anatectic origin.                Repeated injection of mafic magma, and subsequent crustal partial               fusion and melt crystallization will generate significant changes               in the character of the crust beneath long-lived volcanic                       systems.  Recent geophysical studies and excellent geologic                     constraints make this volcano ideal for testing this proposed                   model.  Holocene lavas will be used to test the generation of                   this volcanic suite in small unconnected magma chambers.  Then                  the applicability of the crustal distillation model will be                     tested by comparing differences in the Holocene and Pleistocene                 volcanic suites to determine if temporal changes in lava                        characteristics agree with predictions.  Confirmation of this                   model could dramatically affect petrologists' perceptions of                    magma chambers and quantitative modelling of geochemical data                   from temporally and spatially related lavas.",
