 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interactions between predators and prey are an important part               of all ecological systems.  In recent years, it has become                      increasingly clear that the dynamics of predator-prey systems are               strongly influenced by the behaviors of foraging animals.  Many                 sensory and decision-making processes are involved in the                       behavior of both predators and prey.  Dr. Kamil will                            experimentally investigate these processes in an omnivorous,                    highly skilled predator and forager, the blue jay.  Experiments                 will determine the effects of variation in the spatial and/or                   temporal distribution of prey on where the birds hunt, and for                  how long; the effects of temporal constraints on the breadth of                 the birds' diet; the ability of the jays to collect and utilize                 information about changing, dynamic prey populations; and the                   effects of variation in the appearance of prey on the birds'                    ability to detect the prey.                                                                                                                                     The results of these experiments will be important in three                     related ways.  (1) Because many of the decision-making abilities                of animals evolved in the context of foraging behavior, these                   experiments will help to reveal the nature of these abilities and               their biological significance.  (2) Dr. Kamil's experiments also                will provide basic information about the dynamics of predator-                  prey interactions, which will contribute to our understanding of                ecological systems.  (3) A better understanding of predator-prey                interactions in ecological systems should prove valuable in                     estimating the effects of alterations in natural systems.",
