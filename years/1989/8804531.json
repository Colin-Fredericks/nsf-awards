 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will entail a 20-year follow-up study of the                       Botswana San (Bushman) healing rituals in the context of major                  socioeconomic change,  carried out by a seasoned linguistically                 competent team of male and female researchers.  The goal of the                 project is to produce a contemporary ethnography of |Kung                       religious healing as a response of tradition to new                             socioeconomic factors such as sedentarization, changing gender                  relationships, decreased egalitarianism and an emergent                         politicized leadership.  This project will augment research on                  this society conducted since the 1960s.  Six months of field                    observation will occur at four sites representing a range of                    social relationships between the |Kung San and the pastoral and                 industrial societies they live with.  The frequency, duration,                  personnel, rationales for, and delivered services of healer's                   orations and healing ceremony-songs  will complement in-depth                   interviews on life-histories of healers.  Such research is                      important for the light it sheds on how indigenous peoples                      understand and react to the broad social, political and                         economic trends that overwhelm them.",
