 "awd_abstract_narration": "Usually the ability to withstand competition from                          conspecifics is studied separately from the ability to compete                  with other species, and little is known about the relationship                  between these two abilities.  The aim of this research is to                    investigate this relationship using forest trees as an example.                 Objectives include the construction of a measure of intraspecific               competitive ability, the arrangement of tree species according to               this ability, and the testing of a set of alternative hypotheses                about the relationship by comparing the arrangement with the                    ordering of the species by their interspecific competitive                      ability.  This latter ordering is securely established in                       forestry.  Because the ultimate test of intraspecific competitive               ability is the rate of the decrease in the number of trees caused               by a certain increase in their average, this rate will be                       considered as a measure of the ability.  Among other methods to                 be employed are techniques relevant to ordering and comparisons                 of tree species.  The research deals with basic concepts of                     ecology and is likely to advance our understanding of such                      notions as competition, species richness, and adaptation.  By                   clarifying the confusion between tolerance and self-tolerance of                tree species, this project should also provide a more sound basis               for forest management.",
