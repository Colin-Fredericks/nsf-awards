 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)                             spectroscopy offers the chemist one of the most powerful tools                  available for the study of the physical and chemical properties                 of materials.  Fundamental knowledge of structure and dynamics                  of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals, and                      liquid crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques.                    Solid-state NMR studies often complement those carried out                      using solution NMR and X-ray analysis.  Access to solid-state                   NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program and the                    Instrumentation and Instrument Development Program will help                    the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University to acquire                  a high-field NMR spectrometer suitable for carrying out                         solid-state NMR studies.  The areas of research that will be                    enhanced by the acquisition include the following:                                                                                                              1)  Pulse shape effects in solid-state NMR                                      2)  Studies in heterocyclic chemistry                                           3)  Solid-state structural studies of hexaarylethanes                           4)  Organometallic intercalation compounds as models for the                        reactions of metal complexes with inorganic surfaces                        5)  Structural studies on oxide-bound metal complex catalysts                   6)  Structural and dynamic studies of membrane-bound synthetic                      metalloporphyrins                                                           7)  Structure and dynamics of the profilin:actin complex.",
