 "awd_abstract_narration": "The toothed-lipped gobies are a group of some thirty to                    forty species of fishes distributed in insular freshwater streams               throughout the Indo-Pacific.  They are distinguished from all                   other fishes by a unique typed and arrangement of teeth in their                jaws and also on their gill arches.  This study is aimed at                     describing the tooth arrangement; determining the number of                     recognizable species; and describing how the species are related                to each other.                                                                       Distribution of plants and animals throughout the Indo-                    Australian Archipelago has held a particular fascination for                    naturalists since the last century when Alfred Russel Wallace                   attempted to divide the biota into an Australian and an Asian                   segment.  The toothed-lipped gobies are born and live most of                   their lives in freshwater but make a larval migration to the sea.               This unique lifestyle will be examined to understand how these                  gobies came to be widely distributed on oceanic islands.",
