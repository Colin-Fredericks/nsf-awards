These  protozoans                  have an unusual genetic and developmental system in which genes                 are transmitted from sexual-generation to sexual-generation by a                structure termed the micronucleus. A second nucleus, the                        macronucleus, derives from the micronucleus and functions as a                  special organelle for transcribing and translating genetic                      information into cellular development. The full gene complement                 is transmitted by the micronuclei, but DNA is systematically                    eliminated from macronuclei during cell development. Dr. Huvos                  will determine the function of DNA elimination through a                        comparative study of the chromosomal sites where breakage and                   rejoining occurs during DNA elimination and by determination of                 whether the same DNA sequences are eliminated in different                      species. The comparative study will be made on several species of               the well known protozoan genus Tetrahymena. The conservation of                 breakage sites and the DNA sequences eliminated in many species                 would support the theory that these sites and sequences are                     integral parts of the genetic system for sexual reproduction.                   This study will lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon                of genetic recombination, which is nearly universal among higher                organisms.",
