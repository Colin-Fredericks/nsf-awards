 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last several years the educational community and                     the general public have become increasingly aware of the lack                   of geographic knowledge of students.  The World Regional                        Geography Concepts Project, a cooperative project involving                     the Memphis City Schools System and Memphis State University                    is a response to this situation.                                                                                                                                The focus during the first two years of a three-year program                    will be on upgrading the geographic knowledge of secondary                      (year one) and elementary (year two) teachers.  Each year                       thirty teachers from the Memphis City Schools System will                       receive an intensive (seven hours a day) six weeks (summer)                     content course in geography, including map skills.                              Throughout this same time period, these teachers will modify                    locally and commercially produced geography materials and                       activities to coincide with the local geography curriculum.                     The Memphis City Schools System has agreed to incorporate                       these supplementary activities into the ongoing geography                       curriculum.  During each academic year, University personnel,                   school system curriculum supervisors, and summer teacher                        participants, will conduct in-service training for geography                    teachers.  The activities will be field tested and evaluated                    in all geography courses.  Based on responses by the                            teachers, the materials will be modified as necessary.                                                                                                          Year three will consist of final evaluation and revision of                     both elementary and secondary level materials as well as                        continued in-service and assistance from University                             personnel, school system curriculum supervisors, and summer                     participant teachers.                                                                                                                                           The Memphis City Schools System and Memphis State University                    have contributed an amount equal to 48% of the National                         Science Foundation award.",
