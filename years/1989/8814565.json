 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Strauss is supported by a grant from the                           Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the structure                  and dynamics of molecules in condensed phases in the presence                   of large amplitude motions.  The principal experimental                         techniques employed in this research are high resolution                        Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and infrared laser                      diode spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                                Vibrational spectroscopy, vibrational excitation methods,                    and theoretical analysis will be used to explore the structure                  and dynamics of condensed phases.  Emphasis will be on chemical                 systems that illustrate important general methods or elucidate                  important intermolecular interactions.  The effect of very fast                 reactions on observed vibrational frequencies will be studied                   with the intention of developing techniques for determining                     reaction rates directly from spectra.                                                                                                                             Infrared excitation or \"holeburning\" in crystals will also be                 used to provide information on various dynamical processes such                 as molecular rotation and return to equilibrium by quantum                      mechanical tunneling.  Investigation of holeburning at high                     resolution will be used to determine homogeneous/inhomogeneous                  linewidths and the relationship between spectra, structure and                  strain.",
