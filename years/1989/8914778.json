 "awd_abstract_narration": "Of the five projects outlined in this mathematical research                plan, four will focus on semilinear elliptic partial                            differential equations while the fifth concerns eigenvalue                      problems for second order ordinary differential equations.                           The first tasks involve studies of existence and properties                of positive solutions of semilinear equations motivated by                      attempts to prove large deviation results for weighted occupation               time of the critical branching Brownian field.  These                           probabilistic questions have been the subject of recent                         investigations by several researchers.  Standard techniques do                  not apply in this context because of a lack of certain                          compactness conditions.  When the semilinear equations were first               introduced, some power of the unknown function appeared as an                   isolated element of the equation.  In the present work, the power               of the unknown is multiplied by a continuous function (with zero                boundary data).  The goal is to obtain conditions on the                        multiplier which will ensure the existence of positive solutions-               especially solutions which are not radial.                                           Related work will seek to quantify the number of nonradial                 positive solutions of classes of equations in which the number of               radial solutions has been established.  In addition, work will be               done on the problem of maximizing and minimizing the higher order               eigenvalues of the time independent Schrodinger equation.  The                  variation takes place as the potential is allowed to change                     within a class of potentials.  The first order case has been                    resolved for potentials in the classical Lebesgue spaces.                       Initial efforts will concentrate on the one-dimensional equation.",
