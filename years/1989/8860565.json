 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multidisciplinary investigation is to develop an economical and            efficient ultraviolet absorbing delivery system, based on lignins, for          the nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) which is specific to the gypsy               moth, Lymantria dispar.  Since the NPV is susceptible to ultraviolet            radiation, the successful application of this virus to the field is             dependent upon the development of an efficient and cost effective               delivery system.  This system would associate the virus with a                  protective UV absorber which then could be sprayed onto caterpillar             infested trees and forests as desired.                                                                                                                          The gyspy moth has spread rapidly across the United States and now              represents a serious treat to the Nation's forests.  The development            of the lignin-based delivery system will result in an effective and             environmentally safe treatment for controlling this pest.  In                   addition, the potential market for lignins is large since state and             federal agencies are planning for the spraying of large tracts of               forest and parklands.  The market for homes and nurseries is also very          significant.",
