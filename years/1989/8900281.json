 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study will examine high resolution, rapid sedimentation                     rate record of contourites along western margin of North                        Atlantic in order to decipher the changes in the rate of                        formation of North Atlantic deep water (NADW) and the intensity                 of western boundary undercurrent (WBUC) during the Pleistocene.                 Blake Outer Ridge (BOR), which is the largest contourite drift                  in western North Atlantic and extends form 2000 to 4900 m                       depth, is the target study area.  Its ridge crest contains an                   amplified high resolution signal of WBUC.  Previously funded                    pilot study on WBUC was completed and the presence of a high                    resolution record in BOR cores was identified.  Funding is                      provided to expand on the pilot study through stable-isotopic                   and sedimentological analyses of core tops and 3 piston cores                   and 9 box cores planned to be retrieved during an REU cruise on                 BOR.  A comparison of the core data with sediment structures,                   seafloor photos and hydrographic maps, as well as seismic echo                  character will yield new information about the factors                          influencing physical properties of sediments.  When completed                   the study open line of paleocurrent investigations in                           paleoceanography.",
