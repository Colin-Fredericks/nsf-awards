 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand in greater detail the                 interrelationships of protein structure, stability and                          dynamics.  T4 lysozyme is the protein used as a model.  This                    moderate sized protein has a known 3-dimensional structure.  Many               mutant proteins of this lysozyme exist whose thermodynamic                      stability is modulated by the composition.  Dr. Dahlquist has                   developed a plasmid expression system which allows large amounts                of isotopically substituted protein to be produced efficiently.                 He will use modern nuclear magnetic resonance to study such                     proteins.                                                                                                                                                       The question of how proteins fold is acknowledged as                            one of the most important and least understood of                               modern molecular biology.  A number of related areas would be                   greatly enhanced by the ability to understand in detail why a                   particular amino acid sequence folds into a particular shape                    and how changes in sequence change that shape, its                              thermodynamic stability and its interaction potential with                      other ligands.  Progress in the understanding of the folding                    problem may allow more reliable predictions of structure from                   sequence data with a corresponding increase in the                              sophistication of engineered protein products.",
