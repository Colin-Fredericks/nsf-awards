 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Thomas               Cronin, University of Maryland Baltimore County and Dr. Michael                 Land, University of Sussex, England.  The research will focus on                the optics and movements of stomatoped crustacean eyes.                                                                                                         Stomatopod crustaceans have unusual and specialized visual                      systems, characterized by two unique features.  First, each eye is              triple in organization - three regions of one eye view the same                 point in space.  This design may be used for distance perception                and hue discrimination; it also may provide polarization vision                 and an unusual type of form vision.  The other characteristic                   feature of stomatopod vision is that the eyes scan large visual                 fields, but do so without bilateral coordination.  The proposed                 study will examine the internal filters and visual pigments of the              various eye regions using microspectrophotometry, and work out                  their contributions to spectral sensitivity.  Using interference                microscopy, the investigators will learn how stomatopods form                   images on their retinas.  Finally, the investigators will learn                 how the investigators will use a video computer interfacing method              developed by Dr. Land to analyze stomatopod eye movements during                scanning, tracking, fixation, and optokinesis.  These studies will              not only assist the two major laboratories working on stomatopod                vision to coordinate their research, but also are expected to have              results of general significance for vision science and for the                  application of artificial intelligence to computer/robotic vision.",
