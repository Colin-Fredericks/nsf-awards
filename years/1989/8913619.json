 "awd_abstract_narration": "A noninvasive technique for measuring the temperature field                     inside three-dimensional living tissue using tomographic                        methods based on electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of                                                                                                  nitroxide stable free radicals will be developed.  The studies                                                                                                  will examine temperature variations likely to be encountered                    in experiments and in clinical applications involving                           hyperthermia in the mammalian body.  The experiment consists                    of three major parts:  First, detailed data on temperature                      dependent spectra of appropriate nitroxides will be obtained                    in model systems, such as solutions and blood:  Second, the                     spectra will be reexamined in the tissues of living,                            anesthetized mice with the additional objective of localizing                   the signal to specified, small additional objective of                          localizing the signal to specified, small volumes.  Third,                      preliminary work will be done on the development of                             tomographic applicable to this method.                                                                                                                          The most significant result of this research would be a                         breakthrough in noninvasive temperature measurement                             techniques.  A major shortcoming of current hyperthermia                        procedures is the uncertainty of the temperature distribution                   in the region of the application of the thermal treatment.                      The primary aim is to develop an effective and reasonably                       economical technique for                                                        in vivo uses.  Variations of the technique, however, could be                   developed for other uses as well.  Thus, ESR based thermal                      tomography would become a significant new component in the art                                                                                                  and science of heat transfer.",
