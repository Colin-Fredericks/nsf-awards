 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) consists                 of a bilateral seminar entitled \"Economic Growth in Modern                      Industrial Societies: The United States and the Soviet Union.\"                  The seminar is jointly sponsored with the Academy of Sciences of                the USSR (ASUSSR).  It will be held in Moscow from November 28 to               November 30, 1988.  The NAS chairperson for the seminar is Dr.                  Marina Whitman, Vice-President and Group Executive of the General               Motors Corporation.  Academicians Konstantin Frolov, Vice-                      President of the ASUSSR, and Leonid Abalkin, Director of the                    ASUSSR Institute of Economics, have been designated as the Soviet               co-chairmen.                                                                                                                                                    The seminar will help to clarify some of the most important                     factors affecting economic growth in the United States and the                  USSR by bringing together leading economists and industrialists                 of the two countries for presentations and discussions.  Of                     particular interest are current Soviet economic reform activities               and the growing importance to the United States of international                economic and financial developments.                                                                                                                            The seminar is structured in five topical areas: (1) patterns and               trends in economic structure and aggregate productivity;  (2)                   economic aspects of technology innovation and diffusion;  (3)                   management issues;  (4)  marketing and finance;  and  (5)                       international aspects.                                                                                                                                          Following the seminar, American participants will meet with                     economists and other relevant specialists at key institutions and               will visit industrial facilities in Moscow and Leningrad. The                   seminar and the subsequent industrial visits have the potential                 for promoting greater interaction and understanding among                       American and Soviet economists and for identifying areas of                     mutual interest for further joint exploration.",
