 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Prof. Bennett Shapiro of the University of              Washington in a research collaboration with Prof. Alberto Darszon of            the Centro de Investigacrones y Estudios Avanzador (CINVESTAV) in               Mexico City. The reserarchers intend to explore the mechanism whereby           sea urchinsperm respond to eggs of the same species.  It is known               that peptides that diffuse from the egg to bind at the sperm surface            cause the sperm to alter several ultra cellular parameters.  The                pepticles may play a chemotactic role and also cause transient                  elevations in ultracellular \u0131Ca2+! and \u0131cEMP!.  Preliminary data                suggests the presence of a cGMP- dependent Ca2+ chfannel in plasma              membranes from the sperm.  Possible candidates for such a channel               will be purified and their characteristics explored in reconstituted            bilayer systems.  Such a channel may be a component of the signal               tranduction pathway of sperm chemotaxis; an analysis of its properties          may clarify the mechanism of the analogoris channel that is responsible         for photo transduction.l                                                                                                                                        The sea urchin sperm offers some distinct advantages one more complex           cell types as a basic model for chemostraxis.  Many of the superflous           (in this context) cellular activities related to the cell cycle,                growth, and differentiation are absent from the spermitozoan.  The              amplified metabolism of this non-dividing cell and its limited                  stimulus for chemotaxis are in contrast to E. coli, which respond to            a host of attractants and repellants and are actively growing and               dividing.  Thus the metabolically mono focused sperm array allow                researchers to unearth some biochemical mechanism in the pathway of             chemotaxis.  By combing the strengthsof the Mexian group in planar              bilayer studies with special interests in the recoinstitution of                membraneprotein channels, with the experience of the U.S. group in              functional studies of purified proteins that mediato cellular behavior,         this study has the potential to increase our understanding of sperm             chemotaxis and egg-sperm interaction.",
