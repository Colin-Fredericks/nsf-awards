 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transport of stress and scalar quantities in turbulent premixed             flames is difficult to predict because of the interaction between               spatial and temporal fluctuations of the controlling parameters.                Modeling the dynamics requires elimination of troublesome terms in the          equation of motion.  One set of elusive parameter involves pressure-            velocity fluctuations.  The research will focus on a technique to               measure these fluctuations in isothermal flows by substituting                  nonintrusive laser methods (multiple-beam, laser-doppler anemometry             and Rayleigh scattering) for intrusive mechanical microphone probes.            The pressure fluctuations will not be measured directly but will be             calculated from the volume integration of the density-velocity                  gradients.                                                                                                                                                      The proposed research deals with pressure fluctuation measurements in           an isothermal jet.  Quantitative results which are repeatable and of            high accuracy will lead to similar measurements in reacting jets, will          further our understanding of turbulence, and will increase the                  scientific basis for combustion modeling.",
