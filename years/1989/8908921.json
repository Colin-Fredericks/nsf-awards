 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well known that behavior is affected by environmental                     events.  Recently it has become possible to write mathematical                  equations that describe the relationship between behavior and                   environmental events.  Certain properties of behavior (such as                  how often it occurs) and certain properties of environmental                    events (such as how often positive consequences for behavior                    occur) appear in the equations.                                                                                                                                 Equations that describe behavior-environment relationships are                  usually generated by mathematical theories.  A number of                        different mathematical theories are currently being studied, but                not all of them can be right.  The purpose of Dr. McDowell's                    research project is to study one of these theories, known as                    linear-system theory, and to compare it to another theory, known                as matching theory.  Matching theory is an older account that has               been very successful, but which seems to have some limitations.                 Linear-system theory is a newer theory that appears promising and               has the potential to be more comprehensive than matching theory.                                                                                                Dr. McDowell's research project includes mathematical work and                  empirical work.  The purpose of the mathematical work is to                     further develop the linear-system theory.  The empirical work                   involves standard laboratory preparations that require an                       organism (a human, a pigeon, or a rat, depending on the                         experiment) to execute a simple behavior (a lever-press or a key-               peck) in a controlled environment where occasional consequences                 (delivery of money, brief access to grain, or brief access to                   water) are arranged for the behavior.  Many results obtained from               this type of laboratory preparation have been shown to generalize               to naturally occurring human behavior.  The purpose of the                      empirical work is to test the linear-system theory, and to                      determine if it is more comprehensive than matching theory.                                                                                                     The results of the mathematical and the empirical work will tell                us how good the linear-system theory is, and so will take us                    further toward the goal of understanding, in a precise and                      quantitative way, how the environment regulates behavior.",
