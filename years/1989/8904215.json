 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous investigations have focused on the distribution and               stereochemistry of amino acid constituents of fossils to assess                 indigeneity.  However, the occurrence of amino acids as                         components of all past and present organisms makes it impossible                at this time to precisely determine the extent to which an                      individual amino acid in a fossil represents original material                  produced by an organism versus input from the surrounding                       environment.                                                                         The primary objective of this investigation is to continue                 the development of a new set of criteria for evaluating the                     origin(s) of amino acids in terrestrial and extraterrestrial                    geologic materials that is based on an assessment of the stable                 carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of the individual D- and               L-enantiomers of amino acid constituents of these materials.  To                accomplish this task, a series of experiments are planned to                    further our understanding of the effects of diagenetic reactions                on the stable isotope compositions of individual amino acid                     enantiomers as follows:  1) simulation experiments to assess the                effects of protein and peptide bond hydrolysis on the stable                    isotope compositions of D- and L-enantiomers of amino acids; and                2) determination of the stable nitrogen and carbon isotope                      compositions of D- and L-enantiomers of amino acids isolated from               various molecular weight, proteinaceous fractions of fossil                     mollusks.                                                                            At present, the isolation and stable isotope analysis of                   individual enantiomers of amino acids from fossil systems is a                  labor intensive, time consuming process.  We will attempt to                    circumvent this problem by developing a method for the direct                   stable isotope analysis of quantities of amino acid enantiomers                 via on-line gas chromatography/stable isotope mass spectrometry                 (GC/SIMS).  If successful, this approach will revolutionize the                 ability of scientists to utilize stable isotopes as probes at the               molecular level (e.g., elucidation kinetic isotope effects,                     raceminzation processes and biosynthetic pathways for the                       formation of amino acids in living systems) and will open new                   doors with respect to furthering our understanding of 10                        extraterrestrial, prebiotic organic synthesis and 2) the                        chemical evolution of living systems on earth.",
