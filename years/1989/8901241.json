 "awd_abstract_narration": "The material flow within manufacturing can be characterized                by three different types of activities:  make activities; move                  activities; and store activities.  The configuration of the move                and store processes is a fundamental system design decision.  The               objective of this research is the characterization of system                    performance in terms of this configuration decision.                            Specifically, the objective of this project is a mathematical                   methodology and associated computational techniques for rapidly                 and accurately predicting performance for a special class of                    manufacturing systems.                                                               The approach to be used is based on a network of queues                    model developed in a prior work, however, the solution approach                 in this project involves the decomposition of the real problem                  into separate problems for the major system elements.  The                      subproblems will be analyzed using models such as continuous time               Markov chain models and queueing models.                                             This project will produce the characterization and the                     analysis tools for a broader class of applications than existing                analytic methods.",
