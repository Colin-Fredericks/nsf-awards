 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by J. Kurz of Washington University is supported                   by the Organic Dynamics Program, and is aimed at a better                       understanding of the role of solvent molecules in certain                       substitution reactions.  This problem will be investigated by                   the observed changes in the rate of the reactions upon isotopic                 substitution.                                                                                                                                                   Investigations will continue into the origins of the recently                   observed anomalous isotope effects on the rates of chemical                     reactions.  These anomalous isotope effects are for methyl                      transfer reactions in polar solvents; they seem to imply that                   during methyl transfer to an uncharged oxygen nucleophile,                      changes in bonding and solvation are highly asynchronous.  In                   order to accommodate these data, some revision will be                          required: either of current physical organic theory, or of                      current approaches to the interpretation of kinetic isotope                     effects.  The origin of these anomalous effects will be                         elucidated by (a) measurements of complete sets of isotope                      effects on the rates of reactions that are known to present                     anomalies, and on the rates and equilibria of model reactions,                  (b) the theoretical estimations of observable consequences of                   the implied bonding/solvation asynchronies, and (c) the                         computer modeling of transition state force fields that is                      required for the quantitative interpretation of those sets of                   isotope effects.",
