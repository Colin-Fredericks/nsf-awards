 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nonlinear optical interface problem has been of great current               interest for a long time.  Analytic, numerical and experimental                 techniques have been used in attempting to understand the behavior of an        optical beam incident at small glancing angle on the interface between          two dissimilar nonlinear dielectrics.  The most detailed numerical              studies to date have suffered from the defect of being only two-                dimensional in nature, and so cannot model accurately the three-                dimensional experimental results.  Recently, the PI received a grant of         Supercomputer time from the Peer Review Board of the National Center for        Supercomputing Applications to develop such a three dimensional model.          This proposal is submitted to NSF to obtain funds for the purchase of a         graphic display device to aid in the development of visualization               techniques for displaying results of the aforementioned numerical               simulation.",
