 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many industries, the entry of new firms increases market                     competition.  Similarly, the exit of firms may decrease market                  competition.  Although government trade, merger, and antitrust policies         recognize the competitive consequences of entry and exit, not much              evidence exists on their quantitative importance. Thus, while current           merger policy implicitly presumes that competition prevails in markets          with at least four to six equal-sized firms, not much is known about            the consequences of allowing a merger that removes the second, third,           or fourth firms from a market.  Similar questions arise in policy               debates about the effects of foreign competitors.                                                                                                               This research will develop a framework for measuring the effect of              entry and exit on market competition.  Specifically, measures of the            extent to which market competition departs from perfect competition             will be developed.  These measures take into account several practical          problems that confront policy analysts, including the limited amount of         information available on the incentives for firms to react to new               entrants.  These measures are also related to a variety of economic             factors that affect firms' incentives to compete through entry and              exit. In particular, it is recognize that large capital or research             investments may be necessary to ensure successful entry.  These methods         will be used to study the competitiveness of a variety of retail                markets and professional occupations and also the effects of mergers.",
