 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous NSF-supported research has made available over 25                 U-Pb zircon ages that have provided an important temporal frame-                work for the geological evolution of the Adirondacks.  Among                    these new results are at least two that require further field and               chemical investigation.  The first ~1300 Ma mettonalitic rocks                  exposed in the southern and eastern Adirondakcs and exhibiting                  calcalkaline trends.  These rocks, and associated granitic                      gneiss, suggest the presence of an early collisional magmatic                   arc.  Within the Adirondack Lowlands Hyde School Gneiss of ~1300                Ma age also exhibits calcalkaline trends and perhaps a second                   early collisional magmatic arc.  These two postulated arc-related               terranes docked against one another prior to the emplacement of                 the 1160-1130 Ma mangeritic-charnockitic suite which traverses                  both regions.  It is proposed that chemical studies be critical                 to the plate tectonic evolution of the Grenville Province.  In                  addition, the intrusive vs. metavolcanic history of the Hyde                    School Gneiss is to be investigated by field and chemical means.                     It is also proposed that chemical studies involving the                    modelling of differentiation trends be applied to ultramafic                    dikes and sheets in the Diana Complex and on Jenkins Mt. in the                 Marcy massif.  The former crosscuts syenite dated at 1154+3 Ma                  and the latter carries xenoliths of mangerite from the 1147=6 Ma                Stark suite will help constrain the currently uncertain upper age               of anorthosite emplacement.",
