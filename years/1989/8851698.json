 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exploring complex topics in general biology laboratories is often               impossible due to economic, technical, ethical, or time                         constraints   Students work algorithmically from rigid manuals,                 mimicking scientific practice without understanding it.  Rarely                 do they learn that science is a dynamic, problem-solving activity               as opposed to a collection of laws and facts.                                                                                                                   Funds from this award will be used to develop a new computer-                   based laboratory curriculum for general biology, designed to                    emphasize open-ended problem-solving activities that more closely               resemble what scientists actually do.  Students will be involved                in posing, testing and evaluating hypotheses, and in                            communicating their ideas to their peers.  Graphics-oriented                    computer workstations, equipped with production software (e.g.                  spreadsheets and custom simulations of biological systems, will                 be used by students as tools to practice science.  Activities                   will include:  (1) use of spreadsheets and statistical packages                 to help organize data, discover patterns, and test hypotheses;                  (2) use of flexible simulation environments (\"lab construction                  kits \") that provide an electronic toolbox of components from                   which students can design their own experiments; and (3)                        establishment of an electronic journal with students and faculty                working together as editor and reviewers.  The grantee                          institution is matching this NSF award with funds from non-                     Federal sources.",
