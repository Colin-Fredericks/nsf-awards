 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support for a three-year investigation of                   sedimentation processes at grounding lines of tidewater glaciers,               and at a deltaic system, in SE  Alaska.  The study is designed                  around an unmanned cruise-submersible to collect data that is                   extremely difficult to obtain using any other means.  This will be              the first attempt to directly observe and quantify processes at a               modern grounding-line with such vigor.  A group of four                         researchers will study retreating, slowly advancing, and rapidly                advancing tidewater fronts, as well as older grounding-line                     deposits.  The submersible will also be used to evaluate submarine              mass movement processes and the settling of particles from                      suspension which produce laminate deposits.  The field program                  will emphasize collection of data provided by side-scan sonar,                  seismic reflection profiling, video tapes, stereo still                         photography, CTD surveys, current meter measurements, and samples               of suspended and bottom sediment.  Most data will be recorded in a              manner that will allow an evaluation of the field procedures, and               modify them if necessary.  The study will provide critical data                 for modelling the processes and depositional systems of glacial                 grounding lines.  The results will contribute to current models of              quasi-stability and advance of marine glaciers.  The data will                  increase the reliability of sedimentological models for                         interpreting stratigraphic successions, and for predicting                      sediment budgets in different glacimarine depocenters.  An                      evaluation of the ability of sediment gravity flow channels to be               eroded in different glacimarine basinal systems will be made.                   Lastly, the research will test a new hypothesis on how laminitis                can be produced.  The process is thought to be applicable to both               glacial and non-glacial marine environments.",
