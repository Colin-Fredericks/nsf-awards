 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the investigator proposes a systematic                          evaluation of a new-type of membrane to be used in separations                  processes.  The principal novel aspect of the proposed work is                  formation of the membrane by polymerization of two monomers,                    mutually insoluble, one dispersed inside the other, after the                   dispersion has been pressed between glass plates.  When very                    high volume fractions of the dispersed phase monomer are used                   the emulsion consists of polyhedra of the dispersed phase                       monomer separated by thin lamella of the continuous phase                       monomer.  The principal application which is to be made of                      this new type membrane is to separate one solvent from its                      solution in another solvent, though other applications are                      certainly possible.  The dispersed polymer is chosen so that                    it is readily soluble in the solvent one wishes to remove from                  a mixture of solvents, but is insoluble in the solvent one                      wishes to retain.  The continuous phase polymer, however, is                    insoluble in both solvents.  The very thin lamella of the                       continuous phase offer a very low mass transfer resistance.                     The dispersed phase polymer, once saturated in the solvent to                   be removed, gives both high selectivity and liquid-like                         diffusion coefficients, so that very high fluxes should be                      obtainable.                                                                                                                                                     Two examples have been presented.  In one, toluene is                           separated from cyclohexane using a membrane with polystyrene                    as the polymerized dispersed phase and polyacrylamide as the                    polymerized continuous phase.  In the second, water is                          separated from ethanol using a composite membrane in which                      polyacrylamide is the polymerized dispersed phase and                           polystyrene is the polymerized continuous phase.  In both                       examples the new membranes give fluxes and separation factors                   comparable to the best that has been achieved with any other                    type of membrane.  This is highly novel and innovative work                     with great potential for introducing a whole new generation of                  membranes.",
