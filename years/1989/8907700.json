 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides the first of an expected two years of                       support.  It allows Dr. Waselkov and his colleagues to excavate                 the early historic Creek Indian site of Fusihatchee which is                    located in Alabama.  Preliminary work shows that this extremely                 rich and well preserved site contains undisturbed house floors                  and buried chache pits as well as human skeletal remains.  Dr.                  Waselkov and his team will follow up their now complete                         preliminary excavations with large scale work.  Mechanized                      equipment will strip overburden off horizontal areas and this                   will be followed by careful excavation.  Analyses will focus on                 the faunal and floral materials recovered as well as the human                  burials, and material remains both locally produced and obtained                through trade.                                                                                                                                                  The goal of this research is to understand how the Creek                        responded to European contact.  When Columbus discovered the New                World, the Creek constituted one of the largest and most highly                 organized tribes in the U.S. Southeast.  By 1840 their                          independence has been lost.  While the outcome of this                          interaction is not surprising, the process of interaction between               Creek and European cultures is of great interest.  After an                     initial depopulation and disruption caused by disease, it appears               that Creek culture actually flourished as a result of contact.                  As they became part of a commercial network and supplied products               such as deer skins to the European market, social complexity,                   status and internal differentiation actually increased.  Dr.                    Waselkov's excavation will serve to confirm and provide new                     insight into this process.                                                                                                                                      This research is important because it provides new insight into                 the effects of contact between more and less advanced social                    groups.  In many less developed parts of the world this process                 still continues today and directly affects politics in such                     countries as the Philippines.  It is important to understand how                this works.  Fusihatchee is also an endangered site.  It has been               subjected to looting and the and on which it lies will soon                     become a gravel pit. //",
