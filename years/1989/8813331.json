 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Robert L. Wheeler and others of the Department of           Mathematics, Virginia Tech, for collaboration with Stig-Olof Londen             and others of the Institute of Mathematics, Helsinki University of              Techology, Espoo, Finland.  Their research concerns the dynamics of             Volterra integro-partial differential equations, functional                     differential equations and abstract Volterra equations, and also                control and stabilization problems for systems governed by such                 equations.  Through collaboration, a variety of techniques will be              applied to investigate these problems including: 1) classical                   analysis methods which combine techniques developed for finite                  dimensional Volterra equations with techniques for hyperbolic                   differential equations; 2) abstract methods including those from                semigroup theory and nonlinear functional analysis; and 3) semigroup            and duality methods whereby an infinite dimensional abstract equation           is approximated by finite dimensional systems, and numerical studies            based on such approximations.  The expertise of the Finnish                     investigators in harmonic analysis and energy methods developed for             the study of qualitative properties of Volterra equations should                commplement the strengths of the U.S. investigators in functional               differential equations, control theory and other subjects relevant to           the proposed research topics.                                                                                                                                   The six collaborating investigators have outstanding reputations for            expertise and productivity in this area of applied mathematics.                 Previous interactions among three of them were fruitful.  Significant           contributions to mathematics can be expected from expanded                      collaboration between the two research groups.",
