 "awd_abstract_narration": "Primary emphasis of this mathematical work will be                         directed at three problem areas: nonlinear transport equations,                 regularity theory in the calculus of variations, and geometric                  properties for motion hypersurfaces by mean curvature.  All, in                 one way or another, are concerned with nonlinear problems in                    analysis.                                                                            Nonlinear transport is modeled by relatively simple                        partial differential equations (e.g. scalar conservation laws                   or the porous medium equation).  The goal here is to use the                    newer concept of viscosity solution and expand its role from                    spaces metrized by maximum norms to the Lebesgue space of                       integrable functions, in an effort to understand solutions.                     The key is the introduction of weak solutions of differential                   operators satisfying an accretive condition, with the                           expectation that an interpretation of non-smooth solutions                      will result.  A long-term goal of this work is that of                          analyzing the hydrodynamical limit of stochastic interacting                    particle systems.                                                                  A second line of research concerns the question of partial                   regularity for vector-valued problems in the calculus of                        variations - in particular, for problems of nonlinear                           elasticity.  The basic issue here is that of performing                         variations within the constraint which requires that the                        determinant of the differential be positive.  Work will proceed                 first with more tractable questions involving minimizers of                     convex integrands for mappings between manifolds.                               Considerable activity is presently under way investigating                      geometric problems of motion by mean curvature.  The associated                 partial differential equations, which give the motion of level                  sets (of a manifold) moving normally at a velocity proportional                 to the mean curvature, may have solutions with singularities.                   The first concern of this work will be to show that the level                   sets are smooth except possibly for negligible singular sets.",
