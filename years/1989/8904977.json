 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests partial support for highly qualified                     junior scientists and a few invited speakers to attend the Second               International Veterinary Immunology Symposium.  This meeting will               be held in Hannover, West Germany, July 24-28, 1989, as a                       satellite symposium of the Seventh Internatonal Congress of                     Immunology in West Berlin, July 30-August 5, 1989.  The Symposium               will cover research in all areas of immunology focused on data                  obtained in domestic and wild animal species.  It is intended to                be complementary to the Congress in Berlin.  The American                       Association of Veterinary Immunologists and the American                        Association of Veterinary Parasitologists, in their newsletters,                will solicit applications from junior scientists to compete for                 travel grants to attend the Symposium.  The AAVI and AAVP hope to               match the funds requested from the NSF with travel awards from                  industry.                                                                                                                                                       This Symposium will be an important opportunity for U.S.                        scientists to present their current research results and interact               with their international colleagues.  Increased knowledge of the                immune function of a variety of domestic and wild animal species                will expand our understanding of the approaches needed to                       maintain the diversity of organisms.",
