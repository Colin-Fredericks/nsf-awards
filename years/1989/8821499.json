 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to use inclusion chemistry to                 synthesize and characterize electro-optic materials which can be                fine tuned and switched as nanocomposites.  The preliminary                     research has demonstrated our ability to define the compositional               phase space of an extensive class of materials which have the                   same topology as one of the premier nonlinear optic crystals                    known, KTP.  The phase space of a second inclusion structural                   family, ABCO4, is being explored and has been shown to contain                  members with optical windows to 0.2 um and large SHG                            coefficients.  Reversible gas phase adsorption, guest/host                      interace chemistry, and solid state substitution chemistry are                  being used to modify electro-optic behavior with respect to SHG                 and phase matching.  Exploratory research using a variety of                    synthetic techniques is proposed in our search for new nonlinear                optic inclusion hosts.  A second objective of this research is to               examine the nonlinear optic response as a function of externally                induced atomic displacements by applied electric field,                         temperature, and pressure.  Exploratory synthesis into new                      structural types will make use of the structure/property                        relationships determined in the above studies.",
