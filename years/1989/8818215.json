 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be carried out to investigate the cause and                       evolution of the nova outburst and the driving mechanism of the                 hot, pulsating variable stars.  The studies will use a                          Lagrangian, hydrodynamic computer program that includes a large                 nuclear reaction network, element diffusion, accretion, new                     surface boundary conditions and the latest available equations of               state.  The specific projects are: (1) a study of the                           consequences of accretion of hydrogen rich material onto a                      strongly magnetized white dwarf; (2) a study to explore the                     various mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the                       observed abundances of the intermediate mass elements and make                  specific predictions with respect to Na-22 and Al-26, (3) a study               to determine the cause of the cessation of nuclear burning and                  the return to quiescence of the white dwarf which will include                  the effects of dynamical friction and radiation pressure driven                 mass loss; (4) a study of the recurrent nova phenomena                          concentrating on T Pyx, a slow nova due for an outburst in the                  near future; (6) a study of the helium abundance in the envelopes               of the GW Vir (PG1159-035 variables) by means of nonradial,                     nonadiabatic analyses and new compositions; (7) a study of the                  pulsating white dwarf in the V471 binary system with the intent                 of discovering the cause of its variability; (8) a study of                     cooling sequences, with diffusion included, for the PG1159-035                  variables; and (9) optical spectroscopic studies of novae in                    outburst and blue stellar objects from the Case Blue Star survey.",
