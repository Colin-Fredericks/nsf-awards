 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the floating zone method of crystal growth the thermal gradient              imposed along the free surface causes toroidal convection cells.  As            the temperature gradient is increased it has been observed                      experimentally that the steady convection cells lose stability and an           oscillatory pattern develops.                                                                                                                                   In an effort to discover the mechanism associated with this                     bifurcation to oscillatory behavior , modern dynamical systems theory           and bifurcation theory will be applied to fluid flow in a cylindrical           domain with a free surface to provide a qualitative picture of the              existence and stability of solutions in the parameter space.                    Simultaneously the governing equations will be solved numerically,              using a spectral element code to generate the steady convection cells.          These will serve as the base flow for the numerical linear stability            analysis.  The code will also be used to search the parameter space             for the various unsteady  solutions described by the bifurcation                analysis.                                                                                                                                                       The combined attack of analysis and numerics will reveal the mechanism          involved in the loss of stability of the toroidal cells, and more               generally, will contribute to our understanding of the effects of               thermocapillary forces in a microgravity environment.",
