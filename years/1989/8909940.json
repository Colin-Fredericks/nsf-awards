 "awd_abstract_narration": "The unique properties of a fluid near its critical point can                    be utilized to alter principle reaction pathways within a                       reacting system.  The unusual solvent properties of a                           supercritical fluid (SCF) can facilitate reactions which                        cannot be achieved in traditional solvents.  This happens                       because the supercritical solvent provides an environment                       where mass transfer limitations are eliminated due to the                       solvent's physical properties, which lie intermediate between                   a gas and a liquid.  Thus, the high solvent density relative                    to a gas combined with high solute diffusivity relative to                      diffusivity in a liquid, create an environment where high                       concentrations of solute can dissolve in the solution and yet                   severe mass transfer limitations are absent.  The goal of this                  research project are to investigate the effect of SCF solvents                  on the rate processes which control the overall rate of a                       catalytic reaction.                                                                                                                                             Specifically, the PI will attempt to measure the rate of                        adsorption, the rate intraparticle diffusion, and the                           adsorptive capacity of the catalyst under supercritical                         conditions.  He will use chromatographic techniques to measure                  the desired rate parameters under a variety of experimental                     conditions and consider the overall effect of the SCF on the                    reaction pathways by measuring conversion and product                           selectivity.  An application of this technology is in the area                  of hazardous waste remediation through combined SCF extraction                  of organics from the porous soil and solvent regeneration by                    oxidation.  In lieu of this potential use of such systems,                      this work will involve the vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) catalyzed                  oxidation of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (a model compound for many                     hazardous materials) in both supercritical water and                            supercritical nitrous oxide (N2O).",
