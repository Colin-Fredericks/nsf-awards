 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the requirement for metals is increasing, the                          availability of metallic ore is steadily decreasing.  At the                    same time toxic metal-rich waste occurs in several industrial                   processes, often polluting ground water and contaminating the                   food chain.  It is known that organisms such as Thiobacillus                    ferrooxidans can be used to detoxify this waste.  However,                      our ability to take full advantage of the value of microbial                    waste metal management is hampered by a lack of knowledge of                    the genetics and biochemistry of T. ferrooxidans.  To date,                     there are no published procedures for the genetic                               transformation of this organism.  An efficient transformation                   system will permit the genetic manipulation of                                  T. ferrooxidans specifically to improve its metal recovery                      capacity.  This proposal is aimed at the development of such                    a system.  Plasmids conferring kanamycin resistance will be                     used as a marker to test the transforming ability of                            T. ferrooxidans under a variety of conditions.                                                                                                                  The successful development of a transformation system will                      pave the way for the genetic engineering of organisms which                     can be used to recover valuable metals from hazardous                           industrial wastes.",
