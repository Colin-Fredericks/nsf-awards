 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working in collaboration with local scholars, Dr. Tim White will                conduct a large-scale, on the ground survey of areas within the                 Rift Valley region of Ethiopia.  The goal of the project is to                  locate promising sites for paleoanthropological and                             paleontological research.  The survey approach is stratified,                   employing satellite imagery, aerial photography, and light                      aircraft reconnaissance to locate areas of potential                            significance.  These will then be explored in more detail through               vehicle and foot survey and yield data on geological,                           archaeological, and paleontological resources.  A first year                    reconnaissance has revealed several fossiliferous sites of Plio-                Pleistocene age.                                                                                                                                                Ethiopia is one of the most promising areas in the world for                    research into human origins.  The small number of Ethiopian sites               discovered to date have been instrumental in providing material                 evidence for vertebrate evolution and human origins.  Deposits                  yet to be adequately explored contain sediments which document                  the late Miocene period; others, yet undiscovered, likely exist.                A variety of evidence suggests that humans first appeared during                this interval yet, because of the rarity of fossil bearing                      deposits, almost no remains have been recovered.  This research                 will, hopefully, help to fill this gap.                                                                                                                         This research is important for several reasons.  In addition to                 the site inventory which Dr. White and his colleagues will                      produce, it will assist in the training of African scientists.                  It should also serve to strengthen paleoanthropological ties                    between the U.S. and Ethiopia and help establish mechanisms which               will facilitate American work in this country.",
