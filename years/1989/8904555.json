 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Mario Amzel of the Johns Hopkins              University in a research collaboration with Professor Julio Urbina              of the Universidad Central de Venezuela.  The investigators intend              to study the detailed molecular mechanisms of the                               phosphofructokinase (PFK) and the PEP-carboxylase kinase (PEP-CK)               enzymes involved in the energy metabolism of the Trypanosoma Cruzi              parasite.   This parasite, endemic to most areas of Latin America               and the Caribbean, infects animals and humans and in the latter it              causes Chagas - a fatal disease that results in loss of heart                   function.  The kinetic and regulatory properties of the two                     enzymes mentioned above play a central role in the unusual metabolic            strategy of this protozoan parasite.                                                                                                                            Further understanding of these key enzymes will require knowledge               of their three-dimensional structure.  Using X-ray diffraction                  techniques, the investigators intend to gain some insight into                  their atomic structure.  The study will serve to bring together                 the complementary strengths of the U.S. side in X-ray diffraction               studies of energy metabolizing enzymes, with the expertise of the               Venezuelan side in parasite metabolism.  Knowledge of the three-                dimensional structure of any of these enzymes will allow the                    design of more powerful agents against the parasite.",
