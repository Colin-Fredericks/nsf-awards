 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. Ken McAloon and co-workers of Brooklyn             College, City University of New York, to collaborate with Prof. Fumio           Mizoguchi of the Science University of Tokyo, Japan, over a period of           two years. They will explore the development of a new field of logic            study, which they term \"Applied Constraint Logic.\"  The application             of this type of logic to artificial intelligence, operations research,          and software engineering will be explored.                                                                                                                      The purpose of this research is to develop sequential and parallel              constraint solvers for constraint logic programming systems, and                ultimately to combine constraint logic concepts with those of                   artificial intelligence to produce a prototype decision support                 system for financial applications.  Constraint logic programming                combines rule-based systems with systems in which components of a               problem are stated as constraints, and the problem as a whole is                represented by linking the constraints together by means of rules.              In some applications constraint conditions represent problems more              naturally than absolute quantitative conditions, and for these                  problems constraint-based systems should be more efficient than                 standard programming languages.  In this project the Japanese group's           work on arithmetic constraint solvers, and on development of logic              programming systems, will be combined with the experience of the U.S.           group on the development of algorithms for generalized linear                   constraints and on software development in constraint languages.                This research could have great impact on our approach to programming            for artificial intelligence tasks.",
