To ensure that the United States will be                     represented with quality and distinction, and that younger                      chemists have an opportunity to participate, the U.S. National                  Committee for IUPAC will, through the offices of the National                   Academy of Sciences . National Research Council, organize a travel              award program and utilize funds from this NSF grant to provide                  partial support for selected U.S. chemists, particularly younger                ones, attending this meeting.
