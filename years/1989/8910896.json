 "awd_abstract_narration": "he Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program is supporting the                        research of Dr. James C. Martin of the Department of Chemistry                  at Vanderbilt University.  Dr. Martin is developing routes to                   an exciting class of molecules which contain one or more of a                   so-called hypervalent atoms that impart unique properties to                    the molecule.  These will provide the new methods for the                       increasingly complex materials needed by agriculture, medicine                  and industry.                                                                                                                                                   An understanding of the charge distribution and preferred                       geometry for hypervalent main-group element species has allowed                 the development of several bidentate, tridentate, and                           tetradentate ligands to provide important effects on the                        chemical reactivity of these species.  Important tridentate                     ligand species, with two apical fluoroalkoxy ligands connected                  by five-membered rings to an equatorial aryl carbon, are easily                 synthesized by reactions of main-group element species with a                   trilithio derivative prepared from the iodinane by reaction                     with n-butyllithium.  The iodine(V) species, produced by                        oxidation of the iodinane with fluorine, followed by other                      reactions, are useful as oxidizing agents.  A neutral selenium                  analogue with an equatorial methyl group is a very interesting                  methylating agent.  Some of these compounds are expected to                     provide applications in materials science.  The hexaiodobenzene                 dication, which was recently reported as a ten-electron                         sigma-delocalized aromatic species involving the in-plane                       p-orbitals of the six iodines, could be considered a species                    with a pentaiodophenyl tridentate ligand attached to a                          six-electron iodine dication.  The sigma-delocalized aromatic                   system provides stabilization for this tridentate ligand.                       Introduction of other 6-electron centers, such as carbocations,                 to the pentaiodophenyl ligand has been effected and the                         possibility of sigma-delocalized stabilization will be studied.                 Analogues with iodines replaced by other main-group elements of                 similar van der Waal's radii are expected to provide comparable                 sigma-delocalized aromatics, not only for hexasubstituted                       benzenes, but also for naphthalene and other pi-aromatic                        centers, as well as some alkyl centers with arrangements of the                 main group atoms in cyclic array with close arrangement of the                  atoms relative to neighboring atoms.                                            Hexakis-(selenophenyl)benzene dication has been made, with                      evidence for sigma-delocalized aromaticity.  Several other                      aromatic species, with a tree-center four-electron hypervalent                  bond parallel to the p-orbitals of a pi-aromatic system,                        species which are called bis-ipso aromatic species, have been                   prepared.  These provide stabilization for hypervalent boron or                 carbon species, and possibly even nitrogen species.  Aluminum                   analogues of the hypervalent boron species, reported earlier,                   have been prepared for comparisons.  A wide range of elements                   are to be studied in related aromatic species.",
