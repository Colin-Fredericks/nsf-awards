 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports cooperative research by                     Dr. S. Sengupta of the University of Miami and Dr. A.K.                         Mohanty of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur,                       India.  These scientists plan to investigate, experimentally                    and numerically, the heat transfer in the entrance region of                    shells containing finite number of rods.  The study will                        include the effects of the type of array, the relative                          distances (distance divided by diameter) between rods and the                   channel walls, the Reynolds number and the Grashoff number.                     Included will be laminar and turbulent regimes in finite rods                   bundles bound by square as well as circular shells.                             Comparison of experimental and numerical results will be made                   to evaluate the adequacy of existing one-equation and                           two-equation closures in predicting the developing flow.                                                                                                        Scope:  The experimental work on the geometrical types will be                  carried out at Kharagpur.  The analytical work on the square                    bundle will also be carried at Kharagpur, while the analytical                  work on the circular geometry will be carried at Miami.  Thus                   both scientists will contribute to the study and their efforts                  will complement each other.  Both institutes have the                           facilities to do the required work and will be building on                      existing experience.",
