 "awd_abstract_narration": "The homeotic genes of the fruitfly, Drosophila, participate                     in determining the developmental fate of cells. Antennapedia                    (Antp) plays such a role to cause normal generation of the                      fly's thorax and abdomen.  Our goal is to understand in                         molecular terms how Antp carries out its role.  Our attention                   is currently focused on the Antp promoters and peptide                          products.  Antp encodes four proteins, and it makes these                       using RNAs orginating from two independent promoters.  We                       will determine the spatial pattern of RNAs associated with                      each promoter over the course of embryogenesis.  A                              complementary study will be made for total Antp protein using                   mutants lacking activity of one or the other promoter.                          Together these will define the cells which can be influenced                    by Antp action and whether one or both promoters is                             responsible in each cell type.  To understand the functions                     of the different Antp proteins, mini-genes containing the                       cloned cDNAs will be transformed into Drosophila to direct                      ectopic expression of each form.  The phenotypes caused by                      each will be compared to see if they are different, the same,                   or show some overlap.  Our primary goals in this project                        period are to determine why Antp has two promoters and makes                    mutiple protein products.                                                                                                                                       Many of the gene complexes associated with development have                     proven to have intricate regulation.  This study should                         result in greater insight into some of the mechanisms                           utilized at the molecular level.",
