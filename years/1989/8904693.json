 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding for an integrated field,                       geochemical and petrographic study of a granite-diorite-gabbro                  association on the island of Isle au Haut, Maine.  These rocks                  are part of the more extensive Bays-of-Maine Igneous Complex.  A                major concern of this research will be to document and understand               a spectacularly exposed sequence of layered gabbro and diorite                  units which we believe to be the frozen relics of a sequence of                 coexisting melts.  Field relationships show clearly that several                of these layers were gravitationally unstable, and were in the                  process of overturning and mixing.  Recent theoretical studies                  applying fluid dynamics to magma chamber models predict that                    compositionally zone magma chambers, stratified magmatic layers,                and mixing of distinct magma types play important roles in the                  petrogenesis of igneous rocks.                                                       On Isle au Haut we have, perhaps for the first time, an                    unprecedented opportunity to obtain systematic petrographic and                 geochemical data on coexisting magmas within a stratified magma                 chamber.  From this data we will be able to evaluate many of the                magmatic processes predicted to occur in magma reservoirs by                    recent fluid dynamics and experimental studies.",
