 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Holmgren is studying the process of pattern formation within                segments of Drosophila, and is particularly interested in the                   function of two gene clusters, gooseberry (gsb) and cubitus                     interruptus Dominant-Cell (ciD-Ce). He hopes to determine the                   role of the gsb, ciD and Ce genes in segmental pattern formation                by studying their molecular function and their relationship to                  other segmentation genes. In his experiments,he will characterize               the organization and pattern of expression of the ciD and Ce                    genes; make antibodies to the gsb, ciD and Ce gene products;                    determine the hierarchy of gene expression that leads to the                    formation of posterior structures within segments; and study the                promoter regions of the gsb, ciD and Ce genes. By completing                    these experiments, he should understand how cells in the                        posterior part of the segment are distinguished from anterior                   cells.                                                                          %%%                                                                             Many animals are segmented. There is increasing evidence that                   some of the insect and vertebrate genes which control                           segmentation share homologies. The study of these genes in                      Drosophila is enhanced and facilitated by the extensive knowledge               of genetics in this organism. The knowledge gained will most                    likely have more general relevance.                                             %%%//",
