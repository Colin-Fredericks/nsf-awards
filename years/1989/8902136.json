Specifically, work will be done in constructing examples in                     which precislely described singularities are shown to exist,                    and to establish regularity results which show that these are                   essentially the worst possible singularities.                                        Natural conditions on the smmoothness of the solution as                   it evolves in time are known to curtail the formation of                        singularities, at least locally in time.  Among the related                     problems to be considered in this work are questions concerning                 interactions of singularities occurring in cases where caustic                  surfaces appear.  This contrasts with that of simple                            interactions of singularities conormal across smooth                            characteristic surfaces which are well understood.  In addition                 to this, the question of triple interactions will be addressed.                 It is known that piecewise smoothness of solutions in the past                  is not preserved after a triple interaction.  A procedure for                   constructing solutions with given data of conormal or classical                 conormal type will be one of the objectives of this research.                        In four dimensions, simple initial conditions are expected                 to give rise to complex sets of nonlinear singularities.  The                   construction of an example of this type of behavior will be                     treated.  The wave equation on the exterior of a convex                         obstacle will also be considered.  It represent the simplest                    problem involving interaction near a grazing surface of                         singularities; it may give rise to single nonlinear                             singularity.  To accomplish some of these constructions,                        precise regularity theorems will be required to show that                       explicit approximate solutions differ from actual ones by                       remainders of strictly greater smoothness and to extend known                   regularity results to lower order smoothness.",
