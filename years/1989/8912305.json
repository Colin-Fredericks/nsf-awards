 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this award is to continue support for development                of a user-friendly data base of stock market transactions.                      Considerable progress has been made to date in developing the                   data base for the New York and American Stock Exchanges, and two                months of data has been made available at 16 test sites.  This                  data base includes transaction prices for all security trades,                  not just closing trades.  Transactions prices will be maintained                for the most recent ten years of data.  This award will allow the               investigator to complete the work on the New York and American                  Stock Exchange transactions and will provide for the development                of a similar data base for Over-The-Counter trades and quotes.                  These data will be made readily accessible, in a convenient                     format, and at a reasonable cost to scholars doing research in                  the area of financial economics.  At present, information is not                readily available to academic researchers.  This project is                     important because it will allow scholars to explore a host of                   questions regarding the functions of financial markets which at                 present is not possible, given the high cost and access problems                associated with existing data sets.",
