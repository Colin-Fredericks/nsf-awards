 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of tomography was first introduced around 1979                 by the principal investigator, K.T. Smith.  It was introduced                   formally in the mathematical literature in 1985 by F. Keinert                   and K.T. Smith and independently (with a different                              implementation) by E.I. Vainberg and M.L. Faingois.                                  Local tomography allows the reconstruction of a function                   closely related to the attenuation coefficient of an object,                    within a region, from the attenuation along lines meeting that                  region, while standard tomography requires the attenuation along                all lines meeting the full object.  This has significant                        implications in regard to x-ray dose, resolution, the required                  dynamic range of the x-ray sensors, demands on the x-ray tube,                  scatter, compression distortions, scanner size, the size of the                 object to which tomography can be applied, the number of                        numerical computations, and the volume of data that must be                     collected, stored, and processed.                                                    While local tomography has been performed very successfully                in a number of interesting cases, many problems remain in the                   area  of a proper mathematical understanding of how it should be                implemented.  The objective of this project is to acquire that                  understanding, to write sound and effective numerical algorithms                for local tomography, and to make them available to practitioners               and researchers.",
