 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work comprises several topics in the application of                bargaining theory to empirical studies of strikes and other                     disputes.  The aim is further development of bargaining models                  useful for econometric studies and for policy analysis.  Among                  these topics are: the effect of pre-strike negotiations on the                  frequency of strikes; elaboration of the predictions of                         attrition, screening, and signaling models of bargaining, as well               as extensions to include cases with reservation wages dependent                 on employment levels; explanatory mechanisms for the procyclic                  incidence and settlement rates observed in strike data; and                     development of bargaining models and specifications of                          unobserved heterogeneity adapted to econometric estimation.  Data               from previous studies is used to estimate a bargaining model.                   Subsidiary topics include application of bargaining theory to                   legal provisions in general bargaining models, and several                      related technical issues in the general formulation, analysis,                  and computation of game-theoretic models.                                                                                                                       This project is extremely important because it provides new                     insights into the nature of strikes and because it makes                        bargaining models more useful for empirical research.  The                      project links a large body of empirical research based so far on                simple models or data description to rigorous theories of                       bargaining showing conditions under which strikes would occur.                  This will be one of the first efforts to use rigorous theory to                 explain empirical observations and the empirical observations to                test the theories.  Bargaining theory is one of the major tools                 used by economic theorists to study a wide range of economic                    phenomena, so the improvements this project will make in                        bargaining theory will benefit a number of areas of economic                    research.",
