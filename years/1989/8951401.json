 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modern Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance                    spectrometer has become one of the most versatile pieces of                     instrumentation available to the practicing chemist.  The                       availability of such instrumentation for hands-on use os critical               to education and training of the undergraduate student.  The                    acquisition of FT-NMR provides our student with the desired                     exposure to current technology.  The instrument is actively                     incorporated in the sophomore organic course, which has been                    recently converted to the microscale program.  At this level,                   routine proton and carbon-13 data are emphasized.  A more                       detailed discussion of theory and application of NMR occurs at                  the junior level during the year long courses in physical                       chemistry and in our spectroscopy-instrumental analysis course.                 During these courses and our courses in biochemistry, advanced                  organic chemistry, and advanced inorganic chemistry the                         multinuclear, variable temperature, and two dimensional                         capabilities are explored.  The students have first hand                        opportunity to a variety of chemical problems through the use of                the NMR spectrometer.  The institution is providing an amount                   equal to about 125% of the NSF grant toward the purchase of the                 equipment.",
