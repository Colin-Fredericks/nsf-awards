The three boundary-value problems that will be used as              examples include Laplace's equation, Poisson's equation, and the                reduced wave equation.  These equations appear in electromagnetic               fields, heat conduction and diffusion, and fluid mechanics.                                                                                                     The problem of distributing the computational tasks associated                  with finite element method will be addressed.  These tasks include              assembling the system of equations and the solution of large                    sparse, systems of equation using frontal methods and multi-level               adaptive techniques.  Two- and three-dimensional open domain                    problems will be studied as they seem particularly suited to the                hypercube architecture.                                                                                                                                         Furthermore, resources will be used to train interdisciplinary                  graduate students which serve to build infrastructure and foster                collaboration within engineering.",
