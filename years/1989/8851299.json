 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microwave engineering is extensively relying on computer-aided                  design.  A state-of-the-art microwave workstation involves a                    network analyzer and a computer workstation for the design,                     simulation and testing of microwave circuits.  It is planned to                 combine the current microwave circuit simulator Touchstone and                  layout tools MICAD and a workstation with a network analyzer to                 complete our microwave workstation.  The completed microwave                    workstation will be used in three undergraduate laboratories:                   In the Microwave Laboratory, the equipment will enable the                      students to test the microwave circuits the designed.  The network              analyzer will be used both to teach concepts in microwave and to                demonstrate its use as a design tool.  The network analyzer will                be used in the Microelectronics Laboratory.  Microelectronics                   students will learn to perform RF measurements on the bipolar and               field-effect transistors they fabricated in addition to other                   measurements.  Frequency and time-domain measurements will be                   demonstrated in the Electromagnetism Laboratory.  A manual will be              developed demonstrating the use of the network analyzer with                    Touchstone and MICAD for the design, layout and testing of                      microwave circuits and devices in a modern CAD environment.",
