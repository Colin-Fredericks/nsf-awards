 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent failures of transformers indicate that the models used by                manufacturers and designers may not be adequate to study the voltage            oscillations which occur within transformers.  To study this problem,           it is proposed to develop large-scale distributed transformer models            from the standpoint of system identification.  The goal is to                   independently estimate the parameters of the transformer models based           on measurements.  In this study, two transformers will be modeled from          measured frequency response data in the range of 50 Hz to 1 MHz.  The           significance of the proposed research is that the transformer                   manufacturers can use the technique proposed here to independently              validate their proprietary design model and use a validated model to            study the internal voltage oscillations of transformers.  The proposed          technique can also be used by power system engineers to develop                 transformer models and to study transient voltage distribution,                 harmonics and surge performance analysis, and use the models in EMTP            applications and to study RF EM noise generated during the transient            operation of HVDC stations.",
