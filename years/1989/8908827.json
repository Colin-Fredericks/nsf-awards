 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines the mechanisms and functions of a unique                 form of communication, never before studied in detail.  Dr.                     Randall is investigating how a nocturnal desert rodent, the                     banner-tailed kangaroo rat, communicates its identity to other                  kangaroo rats and protects itself from predators by drumming its                hind feet on the ground, creating vibrations that are transmitted               both through the ground and through the air.  She and her                       students will (1) describe the basic patterns in the foot-                      drumming signal and how these identify individual animals, (2)                  study how the signal is transmitted through the desert soil and                 air, (3) describe the changes in behavior of rats in response to                a foot-drumming signal, (4) study foot-drumming as a defense                    against snake predators, and (5) analyze differences in the                     signals produced in relation to the age and health of individual                rats, to differences in the number of neighbors' signals, and in                contexts of territorial defense, predator defense, and mating                   competition.                                                                                                                                                    This research will enrich our general understanding of how                      communication is related to the social organization of small,                   nocturnal mammals.  It will contribute to knowledge of how small                animals defend themselves against their predators, and of how                   animal social organizations have adapted to a desert environment.               An understanding of the interactions that occur in the web of                   life in a desert will be valuable in management and conservation                decisions about the fragile desert ecosystems of the southwestern               United States.",
