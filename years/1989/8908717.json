 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his research into                 the geometry of convex sets.  The project will focus on certain                 non-linear geometric problems.  A long-term goal is to extend                   various known results by the investigator and others to more                    complex Grassmannians.  The motivation for these problems is                    geometrical and frequently has connections with integral geometry               and stochastic geometry.  Techniques from the theory of Radon                   transforms, spherical harmonics, and distributions will be used                 in this new study.                                                                   Solids such as the ball, cube, and pyramid are examples of                 convex sets.  Such sets never bow inward.  The intersection of                  two such sets is always convex, while their union, often not.                   Analogous sets in higher dimensions are particularly important in               business applications.  In this project the investigator will                   extend ideas from the theory of convex sets to a wider range of                 geometric settings.",
