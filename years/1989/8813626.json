 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Mid-Atlantic Mass Spectroscopy            Laboratory (MAMS) for purchase of a new high resolution, double-                focussing mass spectrometer and support of a postdoctoral fellow who            will be active in technique development with the new instrument.  MAMS          is an NSF funded regional facility at The Johns Hopkins University that         provides mass spectroscopic analyses to investigators at a number of            institutions, either as a service or through collaborative research             projects.  Dr. Cotter is an outstanding young investigator known                particularly for his technique development activities in use of time of         flight (TOF) and plasma desorption mass spectrometry which he proposes          to  continue.  The new instrument will replace two older instruments of         differing types.  Collaborative projects include structural studies of          lipids and composition of lipid membranes, structure function                   relationships in enzymes and other proteins, and structures of                  oligosaccharide side-chains on glycoproteins and glycolipids.                       In the last decade or so, mass spectrometry (MS) has become a               technique of increasing usefulness to biologists and biochemists.  MS           is of particular use in the analysis of lipids, of polysaccharides, of          the types and sites of naturally occurring modifications of proteins,           and of other aspects of protein structure including primary sequence.           Because of the expense of their purchase and operation of the                   spectrometers, the disparate types of biological problems for which MS          is useful, and the real but often infrequent need for MS in a given             research project, mass spectrometers are particularly suited for a              service facility such as MAMS that provides analyses for investigators          at a number of institutions.  To be of maximum benefit, such facilities         should be equipped with sensitive and reliable instruments which                minimize the risk of sample loss.  The purchase of a new spectrometer           should insure that the state of the art MS is available to the research         community through the MAMS.",
