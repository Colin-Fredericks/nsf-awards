 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines how a small group of collaborators works               together to design software requirements, and what impact--good                 or bad--the use of groupware (integrated hardware/software for                  group processes) might have on this process.  Scientists from the               University of Michigan will cooperate with colleagues from the                  Software Technology Program at Microelectronics and Computer                    Technology Corporation (MCC) and Arthur Andersen & Co.  The                     specific projects represent the blending of skills in the                       building of computer systems, the empirical analysis of human                   behavior, and the application of theory, both from technology and               from cognitive science, to the design and analysis of technology                augmentations of work.  The approach stresses the need to use a                 vision of future technology environments to navigate the design                 space of collaborative technology, but uses the science base of                 behavioral science on the one hand and computer science and                     information systems on the other to assist in the development of                technology experiments.                                                           The research will pursue the following specific activities:                   Studies of current practice-- 1. An analysis of collaboration                   from interview data already collected by MCC  2. Observational                  studies of collaboration as they occur now; Studies of groupware                supported collaboration-- 3. Studies of collaboration using MCC                 groupware prototypes 4. Studies of collaboration using University               of Michigan groupware prototypes.                                                 The project will use observational methods to study group                     behavior in situ, and will use successive generations of                        groupware prototypes as experimental tools for better                           understanding the collaborative process itself.  The goal of the                project is to contribute to the science base of collaboration                   theory, which is a blend of the behavioral sciences and the                     computer and information sciences interested in understanding how               autonomous agents coordinate their behavior in the pursuit of a                 common task.",
