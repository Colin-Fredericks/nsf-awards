 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of four parts.  Three deal with industrial                organization issues.  The fourth is more foundational.  The first               part studies politics in government decision-making and develops                an agency-theoretic approach to the theory of regulatory capture.               It explores the effect of politics on the regulated firms'                      incentives and pricing, and looks at regulatory institutions                    (constraints on regulatory instruments, hearings).  The second                  part prepares a monograph on incentives and pricing,                            competition, dynamics and politics of regulation.  The third part               looks at the possibility of foreclosing an unregulated market                   through vertical integration and examines the antitrust                         implications.  The fourth part constructs a general concept of                  Markov Perfect Equilibrium and studies its properties.  This is                 important because the Markov Perfect Equilibrium is used to study               many different types of economic problems.                                                                                                                      The research on the politics of regulation is especially exciting               because it develops an original and very promising approach to                  government intervention in industry.  The vast majority of                      theoretical studies of regulation assume that the government is a               benevolent social planner who corrects inefficiencies such as                   monopoly pricing and environmental externalities.  Unfortunately,               this is a very unrealistic assumption.  Government agencies can                 adopt inefficient policies because of the pressure of special                   interest groups.  The goal of this project is to develop a theory               of politics in regulation that captures the interplay among the                 government agency, the regulated firms and the consumer groups                  (environmentalists, consumers of the goods produced by the firm,                and the taxpayers).  The interest groups have different costs of                organization.  The theory is used to prove general theorems about               the effects of different institutions on the behavior of                        regulators.                                                                                                                                                     This project should be supported because it provides useful                     insights into the politics of regulation and into industrial                    organization and antitrust.  The project also produces a                        monograph on regulation that makes the large number of                          publications written for specialists in regulation economics                    accessible to a wider audience.  Finally, it develops a general                 solution concept that should prove useful in applications of game               theory to economic problems.",
