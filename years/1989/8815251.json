 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Lloyd                Mogensen, Northern Arizona University and Dr. Christian Dumas,                  University of Claude Bernard Lyon I, France.  The research will                 focus on the isolation and characterization of male and female                  gametes from three important crop plants, corn (Zea mays), wheat                                                                ___ ____                        (Triticum aestivum) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea).  Isolation                  ________ ________               ________ ________                              procedures, gamete membrane and protein studies, cytochemistry,                 stereology, and cryostorage studies will be carried out by the                  French research team. The portion of the cooperative research to be             done at Northern Arizona University deals primarily with detailed               structural analyses of isolated sex cells, specifically,                        computer-generated reconstructions and computer-assisted                        quantitative ultrastructure based upon complete serial ultrathin                sections.                                                                                                                                                       The experience of the U.S. and French investigators in                          quantitative, three-dimensional ultrastructure and their past and               present work on structural analyses of male and female gametes of               several flowering plants, including corn and wheat, make the                    proposed cooperative research well suited for the two laboratories              involved.  A pilot study, already initiated, has demonstrated the               feasibility of the collaborative investigation.  A long-range goal              of this research is to be able to control and manipulate the                    fertilization process for crop plant improvement.",
