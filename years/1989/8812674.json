 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maps are the fundamental medium of geography.  The information             they contain and their underlying cartographic concepts and techniques,         register the development of human thought about the world.  Maps are            ubiquitous in past societies; they record innumerable aspects of                cultural, scientific, economic, intellectual, political, and social             activity.  The historical study of maps is interdisciplinary, because           maps are major parts of the discourse in a wide range of scientific,            social scientific, and humanistic subjects.  The history of cartography         has matured to the point where it should survey itself, considering its         weaknesses and strengths.  This multi-volume reference work will                provide the first world-wide history of maps and mapping from                   prehistory to the present that is truly representative of all major             cultures and periods, but it will function as far more than a                   fundamental reference.  The volumes will make major philosophical and           methodological statements about the importance of maps in human                 history, and they will demonstrate the relevance of a proper history of         cartography to a wide range of disciplines.  The first volume,                  Cartography in Prehistoric, Ancient, and Medieval Europe and the                Mediterranean has been published.  Scholars throughout the world are            continuing work on subsequent volumes, (2) Cartography in the                   Traditional Asian Societies, (3) Cartography in the Age of Renaissance          and Discovery, (4) Cartography in the Age of Science, Enlightenment,            and Expansion, (5) Cartography in the Nineteenth Century, and (6)               Cartography in the Twentieth Century.  Contributors and consultants to          the work involve an international group and hence the work embraces             non-western cartographic traditions.                                                 This multi-volume history of cartography is important in the               wider context of general knowledge.  It also has a defined and                  significant niche within the history and philosophy of geographical             thought, and it is a tool of interpretative evaluation for the many             systematic branches of geography that employ maps as historical                 evidence.  The History of Cartography provides the opportunity to               document the history of maps as the visual language of geography, and           it places cartographic interactions within the development of the               discipline as a whole.  The volumes also identify specific links                between cartography and the other scientific and technological                  disciplines that have affected mapmaking and map development.  The              completed work will be the most comprehensive assessment of the field,          and it will contribute knowledge to a large number of scientific fields         on an international basis.",
