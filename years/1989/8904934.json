The first is a continuation of joint work with Mladen Bestvina.                 They hope to show that the group of outer automorphisms of the                  free group of rank n satisfies the Tits Alternative.  They also                 hope to complete the characterization of geometric                              automorphisms that was begun earlier.                                                The second project involves the computer implementation of                 algorithms developed earlier to determine the Thurston                          canonical form for an element of the mapping class group of a                   compact surface.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the                     genus zero case, the goal being to understand the dynamics of a                 diffeomeophism f of the two-sphere by studying the canonical                    forms associated to f outside a finite invariant set.",
