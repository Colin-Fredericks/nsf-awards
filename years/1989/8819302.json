 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to study transport properties of disorderd                       electron liquids, both normal and superconducting.  The first                   project is to study inelastic electron scattering in normal                     conducting thin films and wires.  Taking into account realistic                 phonon spectra, this will make possible a parameter-free                        comparison with experiments on free-standing structures.  For                   superconductors, the quasiparticle lifetime will be studied as a                possible source of experimentally observed pairbreaking.  They                  will also explore further experimental consequences of the                      recently proposed coorelation gap mechanism for the disorder                    dependence of the critical temperature.  The third project is to                obtain a better understanding of the metal-insulator transition                 of interacting electrons.  This will be done by a careful                       renormalization group analysis of the model derived by                          Finkelshtein.  It is argued that the renormalization procedure is               much more subtle than has previously been recognized.  Very                     recent evidence suggests that for the properly treated model                    renormalizability can be established.  This will guarantee that                 the resulting flow equations are physically meaningful.  The                    results of this project will make it possible to study the                      breakdown of screening and the destruction of superconductivity                 at extremely strong disorder, thus making contact with the first                two projects.",
