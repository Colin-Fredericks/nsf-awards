 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 2 1/2 year project is designed to develop 40 highly                        trained resource teachers in applications of microcomputers-                    based laboratories (MBL) for middle level science.  These                       resource teachers will then be available in the long term to                    train other science teachers in the use of the technology.                      In addition, some 6000 middle level science students will                       benefit by having MBL experiences as part of their science                      programs.                                                                                                                                                       Some unique features of this project are that \"1) Resource                      teachers will be trained both in formal university workshops                    and on site in their schools through peer coaching; 2) A new                    set of MBL activities will be developed to capitalize on                        existing commercial MBL software and hardware; 3) A strong                      evaluation component will monitor both the degree of                            implementation of MBL and its effectiveness; 4) A new MBL-                      focused course will be created for a permanent offering at                      SDSU; 5) the project will serve a population the majority of                    which consists of students from historically underrepresented                   groups; and, 6) A permanent MBL clearinghouse will be                           maintained as a regional and national repository of MBL                         science learning activities, to provide a directory of                          trained MBL workshop presenters, to run an electronic                           bulletin board for networking interested teachers, and to                       generally promote the use of computer applications in                           regional schools.                                                                                                                                               An amount equivalent to 22.3% of the NSF award is being                         contributed by San Diego State University as cost-sharing.",
