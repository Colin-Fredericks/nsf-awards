Large deviation theory is a branch of probability theory                   involving limits of random variables.  It is well known that in                 certain idealized cases, where the random variables are                         independent and identically distributed, that the average of the                sequence converges to the average of the individual random                      variable (in terms of statistics, that the sample average                       converges to the population average).  Large deviation theory                   shows that the probability that the sample average deviates from                the population average by a small amount is exponentially small                 as the sample size increases.  The principal investigator is                    working in the much more difficult case of dependent random                     variables, whose dependence structure follows a Markov process.                 There are many applications of this theory to statistical                       mechanics and queueing networks.",
