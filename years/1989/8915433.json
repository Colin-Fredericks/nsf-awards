 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a six-month research effort at Kyoto                    University in Japan by Dr. Charles C. Han, Polymer Division,                    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  Dr. Han's               host at Kyoto University will be Professor Takeji Hashimoto, of                 the Department of Polymer Chemistry.  The scientists are                        collaborating on a study of rubber/rubber blends.  Well                         characterized deuterated polybutadiene/protonated polybutadiene and             deuterated polybutadiene/protonated polyisoprene blends will be                 studied, using the technique of small angle neutron scattering                  (SANS) to obtain detailed structural and conformational information             on these polymers.  The blends serve as ideal systems to investigate            the fundamentals of phase behavior of binary systems.  The effects              of chemical crosslinking on phase behavior of these polymer blends              will also be studied.  At Kyoto University Dr. Han will participate             in the synthesis, microstructure characterization, and specimen                 preparation of the various blends.  The SANS measurements will be               carried out later at NIST by Dr. Han and visiting members of the                Kyoto group.  While in Japan Dr. Han will also make brief visits                to other academic and industrial research groups working in this                field.                                                                                                                                                          Polybutadiene blends, polyisoprene blends, and polybutadiene/                   polyisoprene blends of various microstructures are widely used in               the rubber and tire industries.  The blends are tailored to                     achieve various desired properties in the final products.  The                  studies to be carried out in this collaboration may be expected to              lead to a greater predictivity of the phase diagrams of                         rubber/rubber blends, and to other contributions to the technology              base for the rubber industry.",
