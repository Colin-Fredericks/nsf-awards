 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been suggested that aircraft flying                             through supercooled clouds might cause the formation of                         ice particles.  Recent observations of these Aircraft                           Produced Ice Particles (APIPs) have indicated that the                          effect might be quite pronounced.  The magnitude of the                         APIPs phenomenon and the conditions under which it occurs                       is of importance in interpreting the results from previous                      experiments which used research aircraft and in planning                        future projects.                                                                    The Principal Investigators propose a field experiment                      to test the hypothesis that APIPs are caused by                                 aerodynamic cooling in the vortices created behind                              propeller and wing tips.  The experimental sight will be                        near Mono Lake, California which is known for frequent and                      stable supercooled fogs in the wintertime.  The Principal                       Investigators will use a range of aircraft in this                              \"natural laboratory\" to produce APIPs while quantitatively                      sampling the resultant ice particles using a state of the                       art research aircraft.",
