 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science                          Foundation's (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)                    program, which is designed to provide an opportunity for small                  business, particularly the small high technology firm, to                       participate in NSF research.  Phase I of the SBIR program serves                as a filter to select promising proposals and determine if the                  firm can do high quality research.  Phase II is the principal                   research project.  Phase III is the conversion of the NSF-funded                research into commercial applications and technological                         innovation supported by follow-on private venture capital or                    other non-federal financing.                                                         This is a Phase II project to develop a prototype expert                   protocol analyzer, which is an expert system for analyzing                      problems arising between two different implementations of a                     communications protocol.  The expert system tool will incorporate               knowledge of the protocol specifications as well as                             troubleshooting expertise of skilled protocol analysts.  The                    prototype tool will be developed to analyze the entire DoD                      protocol stack running on an Ethernet LAN and will use an                       existing LAN monitor for capture and transmission of protocol                   data on the LAN.                                                                     The expert protocol analyzer could be combined with an                     existing commercially available LAN monitor to provide additional               analytic capabilities for the monitor.  The enhanced tool could                 be used for troubleshooting protocol problems on operational                    networks, assisting in the installation of new protocols, and                   testing for protocol conformance to specification.",
