 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"experimental method,\" it is commonly argued, arose with the                Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. This experimental                    method is one of the most important traits of science which                     distinguish it from other kinds of knowledge which make claims                  about the world (religion, the occult, astrology, for example).                 Robert Boyle, a rich nobleman who became a leading chemical                     experimenter of 17th century England, one of the founders of the                Royal Society, the discoverer of \"Boyle's law\" etc., is as                      important in the history and philosophy of science for his                      justifications of the experimental method as he is for the                      science he actually carried out.  Yet, while Boyle's experimental               philosophy is considered important by all who examine them, there               is no agreement on what he is really arguing.  Indeed, recent                   work within the European tradition of the history and sociology                 of science has argued that Boyle's practices \"involved in the                   generation and justification of proper knowledge were part of the               settlement and protection of a certain kind of social order.\"                   Dr. Sargent has taken this social construction of science                       approach head on and tries to show the role Boyle had in pushing                the experimental method not for social and political purposes but               for the advance of science.  Under this grant, she will examine                 unpublished manuscripts housed in the Royal Society of London in                order to carry out an in-depth systematic account of the details                of Boyle's scientific practice and the manner in which he                       defended it against the serious criticisms of other natural                     philosophers of his day.  This work will lead to a significant                  contribution to Boyle scholarship.  Further, because of Boyle's                 importance in providing a sophisticated epistemological                         foundation for experimentation, this study promises to make a                   valuable contribution to current issues in philosophy of science                as well as to current debates in the historiography of science.",
