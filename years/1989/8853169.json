 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funds from this award will provide the biological sciences at               Clemson University with the instrumentation necessary to instruct               students in 1) the techniques utilized for interfacing                          instruments with microcomputer and 2) systems for the monitoring                for biological data.  The grant will supply funds for the                       purchase of 10 computers, 10 A/D interfacing boards with                        software, 10 amplifiers and the various transducers needed to                   transport biological information to the amplifier and computer.                 Funds will also be used for procurement of electronics and                      transducer components for configuration of student stations that                will allow for the direct  \"hands on\" experience in the                         understanding of the basic electronics associated with transducer               interfacing to biological systems.  An extensive \"hands on\"                     approach to the use of bioinstrumentation will be available to                  the students with theory behind the instruments and their                       limitations stressed in the lectures and the laboratory of a                    bioinstrumentation course.  The students will be exposed to the                 basis electronics and limitations of transducers, amplifiers and                input circuits to the microcomputer.  In addition to providing                  the students with the circuits, amplifiers and transducers needed               for the configuration of computerized physiology monitoring                     systems in this course, students will have these monitoring                     stations available in the various physiology courses.  Portions                 of the lab exercises from the bioinstrumentation course will also               be utilized in the physiology labs to provide the student with a                working knowledge of the basics of transducers, amplifiers nd                   computer interfacing hardware.  The grantee institution is                      matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.",
