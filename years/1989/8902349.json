A range of solutes from low molecular weight, water                     soluble compounds up to globular, water soluble proteins will                   be studied.  It is hypothesized that a different mechanism for                                                                                                  mass transfer exists for low molecular weight compounds as                      opposed to the proteins.  For the low molecular weight                          compounds it is proposed that reverse micelles form because of                                                                                                  random thermal fluctuations of the interface which                              periodically result in part of the interface and the immediate                                                                                                  aqueous phase breaking off to form a reverse micelle with some                                                                                                  of the solute trapped in the interior.  For the higher                          molecular weight proteins, it is hypothesized that the                          approach of the protein to the interface results in the                         spontaneous breaking off of part of the interface to form  a                    reverse micelle, with the protein trapped in the reverse                        micelle.  Theoretical models for these two different                            mechanisms have been outlined.  The phenomena should exhibit                    very different dependence on factors such as concentration and                                                                                                  temperature, so they should be easily distinguished if the                      mass transfer rate can be measured accurately.                                  An innovative technique for measuring the mass transfer rate                    has been proposed for these experiments:  interfacial                           interferometry.  The refractive index of a fluid is dependent                   upon the concentration of any dissolved species.  A beam                        splitter will be used to pass one part of a beam of coherent                    light through a layer of the liquid close to the interface                      between the organic and aqueous phases; when joined with the                    rest of the beam interference bands will be produced whose                      separation will be proportional to the concentration of the                     layer of solution through which the beam passed.  By carefully                                                                                                  controlling the position of the beam parallel to the interface                                                                                                  with an optical bench and equipment to isolate the system from                                                                                                  vibration, the technique should be able to accurately                           determine concentration as a function of distance from the                      interface and as a function of time.  This data then can be                     translated very accurately into mass transfer rates.  Combined                                                                                                  with the theoretical work, this should give a very complete                     picture of the interphase mass transfer in the systems studied                                                                                                  and should enable the investigator to determine the mechanisms                                                                                                  involved.                                                                                                                                                       This system is one of potentially great importance to the                       emerging biotechnology industry.  Reverse micelle extraction                    of proteins from aqueous solution may develop into one of the                   most versatile and effective bioseparation technologies.  This                                                                                                  project should add greatly to its potential for early                           commercial applications.",
