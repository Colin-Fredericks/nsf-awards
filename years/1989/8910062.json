 "awd_abstract_narration": "Color vision is a sensory capability that is extremely valuable                 for discriminating objects.  The retina of the eye detects colors               using the cone cells, containing special pigments that are the                  expression of certain genes.  New discoveries in genetics have                  led to some proposed generalizations about the distribution and                 evolution of color vision in primates, which are considered to be               the only mammals with exceptional color vision.  But very few                   primate species have been rigorously studied for this attribute,                to either confirm or refute the generalized picture.                                                                                                            Earlier work revealed a large variability both among individual                 squirrel monkeys in making color matching tests, and in the                     pigments found in the cone cells of the retina of individual                    animals.  The variation was discovered to be related to                         expression of color pigments based on a single gene on the                      X-chromosome, so there is a fundamentally different variability                 between male and female color perception.  Preliminary studies                  have extended this finding to a few other \"new-world monkey\"                    species, emphasizing the difference from humans and \"old-world                  monkeys\" so far studied, which have a second cone pigment gene on               the X-chromosome.  This project will use behavioral measurements                of color vision, and external recording of retinal potentials                   that convey information about the cone pigments, from a variety                 of monkey and prosimian species.  The data will be used to test                 how valid the generalization may be about color vision in                       new-world and old-world monkeys, and how early in the                           evolutionary branching of primates the genetic split may have                   occurred.                                                                                                                                                       This novel work, using psychology, physiology, genetics, and                    zoology, will have impact on visual neuroscience and behavioral                 ecology, and may even provide some insight into human origins.",
