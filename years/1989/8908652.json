 "awd_abstract_narration": "The results of this study will help in the development and critical             evaluation of models for the thermal destruction of solid organic               wastes and will be used in the design and optimization of                       incinerators.  The first part of this study involves the production of          polymer particles of optimal properties which can be used for the               development and critical evaluation of models of transport processes            in the oxidation of the solid compounds.  The particles will be                 produced spherical in shape and monodisperse by atomization of                  partially polymerized liquid precursors.  In the second part of this            study, the solid particles will be burned in devices such as an                 externally heated laminar flow reactor and a thermogravimetric                  analyzer.  Time resolved measurements of the particle properties, gas           composition, volatilization periods, and particle temperature will be           conducted.  The emphasis will be in investigating the temperature-time          behavior of the solids under pyrolytic or oxidative atmospheres.  By            studying well characterized particles the intrinsic kinetics of                 combustion can be evaluated accurately.                                         The proposed investigation is a fundamental study dealing with the              combustion characteristics of plastics and other organic solid                  hazardous wastes, like adhesives and paints, that end up in the                 municipal waste streams.  This work is based upon the development of            polymers synthesized in the laboratory and                                      tailored for the study of individual chemical and physical                      processes.  The polymers will be similar to those used in the                   plastics industry (Polystyrene, acrylic, highly chlorinated                     hydrocarbons etc.) both thermoplastics and thermosets, in pure                  compound form or mixtures thereof.",
