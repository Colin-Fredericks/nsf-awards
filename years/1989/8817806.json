 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carnivores can have positive as well as negative effects on                populations.  Positive effects may be direct or they may involve                other species in the food web.  How nutrients that affect                       production might interact with a carnivore's impact on lower                    trophic levels has not been investigated.  Experiments are                      proposed in which four food webs will be exposed to up to 5                     levels of nutrients and 5 levels of predation by newts in an                    array of 75 outdoor mesocosms.  The four food webs will differ in               the occurrence of Rana larvae and Daphnia.  Community                           development and production of zooplankton, phytoplankton,                       littoral crustaceans and periphyton will be monitored.  It is                   predicted that the responses of these organisms to predation and                nutrient levels will depend strongly on the structure of food                   webs.  This will be the first experiment to test such                           predictions.  These investigations should provide critical                      insights for understanding natural variation in the abundance of                organisms and in predicting the responses of communities to                     eutrophication and changes in predation intensity.",
