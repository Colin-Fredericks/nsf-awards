 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal is to design a new class of learning                          controllers for non-linear mechanical systems.  A learning                      controller, similar to the human motor control system,                          learns the desired feedforward control input through                            practicing the given task over several cycles.  From one                        cycle to the next, the controller improves its performance                      based on errors from previous cycles and once converged,                        under ideal conditions, it executes the task without any                        error.  This research is divided into five tasks.  Prior to                     this study, the Principal Investigator has developed several                    classes of learning controllers, including the Fourier Based                    and Finite Element Based repetitive controllers.  The first                     task of this project will further refine these two                              approaches, and will include proof of stability and                             experimental verifications.  The second task, neural network                    based learning control, attempts to develop a learning                          controller which can use the information learned from one                       task to perform a different task.  The third task extends                       the second to include force control capability.  The                            modification needed for this task is development of a third                     layer of neural nets to recognize the output pattern of                         force sensors and learn about characteristics of contact                        surfaces, such as stiffness and local geometry.  The fourth                     task focuses on the experimental verification of the                            learning controllers developed earlier.  It requires                            assembling an articulated two degree of freedom manipulator                     as well as hardware and software implementation of neural                       network architecture.  The fifth task will extend the                           activity of the first two tasks to include mechanical system                    flexibility.  This work will contribute to the field of                         dynamic controls and learning systems, and will have                            immediate application to the fields of robotics and                             automation.",
