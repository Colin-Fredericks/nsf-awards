 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues the Foundation's long-term support for the                 National Election Studies (NES).  NES is an organization dedicated to           sustaining and enhancing the diversified data base that supports basic          research on voting, public opinion, and political participation in the          United States.  The importance of NES derives in part from the                  significance of these topics; voting, public opinion and participation          are fundamental to the promise and performance of democratic forms of           government.  The NES represent the largest and most widely used                 longitudinal data collections on electoral behavior in the United               States.  Over the last two decades, NES has provided the conceptual and         empirical foundation for research that has deepened our understanding           of the role that Americans play in their own governance.  At the same           time, because processes surrounding voting, public opinion and                  participation can be treated as special cases of more generic aspects           of social behavior - - rational choice, coalition formation,                    perception, attitude formation and change, and much more - - NES data           have been put to a wide variety of purposes outside political science.                                                                                          In addition to pre/post election surveys of a national probability              sample of the American electorate as the core data collections in 1990          and 1992, this award allows for planning, pilot studies, and                    implementation of research on these two elections.  The award also              provides support for the Board of Overseers that advises the Principal          Investigator on the direction of NES, represents the community of               researchers who use NES data, and guarantees the channeling of fresh            insights and ideas into the election studies.                                                                                                                   The National Election Studies are an important national resource.  They         provide the data base for a large proportion of the research currently          being conducted on American government and politics and will allow              future scholars a solid empirical base on which to chart political              trends.  Important advances in the theoretical understanding of                 democratic processes should result from analyses of these data.",
