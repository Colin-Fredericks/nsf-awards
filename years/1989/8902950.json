 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main part of this project is concerned with a new idea about                the relative dynamics of co-integrated processes at low                         frequencies called synchronization.  Synchronization occurs when                long-run components of an economy are closely related and cause                 important economic variables to move together in phase.  The                    objectives of the project are (1) to develop a simple                           macroeconomic theory which would lead to some form of                           synchronization; (2) to devise tests of synchronization for co-                 integrated series; (3) to develop tests of synchronization for                  series that are not co-integrated; (4) to find an appropriate                   disequilibrium mechanism that leads to synchronized co-                         integration as an equilibrium; (5) to apply the techniques                      developed to various actual series, including interest rates of                 differing maturities, employment rates in different sectors of a                country and GNP per capita for a pair of countries with strong                  trade flows such as Canada and the United States; and (6) to                    survey the literature on synchronization in engineering and                     physics to see if this literature is relevant or applicable to                  economics.  The project also analyzes co-integration with time-                 varying parameters.                                                                                                                                             This is very exciting and important research.   Earlier work by                 the investigator developed a statistical characterization of time               series known as co-integration in which a linear combination of                 data series that are independently non-stationary is stationary.                This development is extremely important because most economic                   time series data typically include non-stationary processes such                as trends.  To gain any meaningful insight into actual movements                of the variables in an economy, one must purge the data of the                  influence of non-stationary processes.  Co-integration tests and                techniques have greatly simplified achieving stationarity                       especially for analytical models including several data series                  each containing similar growth tendencies.  Synchronization, the                subject of this project, opens a new line of research within co-                integration.  Economic equilibrium can be shown to imply                        synchronization of key economic variables.  Thus the tests for                  synchronization developed by this project will give economists                  new and more powerful tests for the existence and characteristics               of economic equilibria.",
