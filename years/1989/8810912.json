 "awd_abstract_narration": "A soluble beta-galactoside-binding lectin with subunit molecular                weight of about 14,000 has been isolated from many vertebrate                   tissues.  The lectin shows striking developmental regulation in                 certain tissues and has been detected on the surface of cells and               in the extracellular matrix surounding them, suggesting possible                roles in regulation of cellular development and in morphogenesis.               Recent studies with the human form of this lectin indicate that                 there are several variants which are the products of distinct                   genes.  These findings raise the possibility that these, like                   other lectins, may have a second functional domain distinct from                their carbohydrate binding sites.  They also raise the                          possibility that these structural variations mediate specificity                in glycoconjugate binding.                                                                                                                                      The purpose of this project is to further characterize this gene                family in humans, with the ultimate aim of understanding its                    regulation and functions.  To this end, a series of full length                 human cDNAs will be isolated and sequenced.  The human genomic                  DNAs encoding members of this gene family will also be isolated                 and sequenced.",
