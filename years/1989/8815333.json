 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Kenneth              H. Westmacott and Ulrich Dahmen, National Center for Electron                   Microscopy, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and Dr. J. Y. Laval,                   Laboratoire des Microstructures, Ecole Superieure de Physique et                de Chimie Industrielles, Paris, France.  The objective of the                   research is to study the microstructural characterization of                    heterostructure strained layer superlattices.  An important                     problem in the fabrication and application of strained-layer                    superlattices is the effect of misfit-dislocations on their                     microstructure and electro-optical properties.  This problem                    arises because, depending on the system chosen, the strain                      developed in the superlattice layers may in some cases exceed the               limit of elastic accommodation.                                                                                                                                 In this joint project, heterostructure strained-layer                           superlattices based on GaAs will be fabricated under closely                    controlled conditions using molecular beam epitaxy.  The resulting              films will be examined by atomic resolution electron microscopy to              determine the overall film structure, the dislocation and defect                character and distribution and the interface structure.  Parallel               in-situ electrical measurements performed on a specially adapted                microscope will relate the microstructure to properties. A                      fundamental study of the effect of substrate orientation and ledge              structure on film quality will be followed by attempts to produce               optimized films with superior properties.  Both the U.S. and                    French groups have significant expertise in the proposed research               area.  The joint project will benefit from access to advanced U.S.              electron microscopes, as well as French strengths in molecular                  beam epitaxy growth of heterointerfaces.",
