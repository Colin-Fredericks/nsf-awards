 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a method to enable                 architects and their consultants to predict the acoustical qualities            of buildings during the design process in an economical and timely              manner.  The results of an earlier NSF Research                                 Initiation grant have shown that ultrasonic scaling of impulse                  response tests made in small-size study models has the potential                to provide a wide range of acoustical information to designers.                 There are 4 main components to the research:                                                                                                                    1.   An extensive series of acoustical measurements will be                          gathered in many types of existing buildings with varying                       acoustical qualities to serve as a design data base.                                                                                                       2.   The objective measurements made in the buildings will be                        related to the subjective assessment of the acoustical                          quality of the buildings by listeners to determine which                        measures are useful as acoustical design criteria.                                                                                                         3.   Acoustical models of the buildings studies in item 1. above                     will be tested to further understand which criteria provide                     the most useful design information in the modeling process.                                                                                                4.   A multichannel data acquisition and digital analysis system                     (Acoustical Research Instrumentation for Architectural                          Spaces (ARIAS)) will be developed to enable detailed                            acoustical analysis at multiple locations in occupied or                        unoccupied buildings and in acoustical models ranging in                        scale from 1:10 to 1:100 to be performed.",
