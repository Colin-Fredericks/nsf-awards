 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific investigation of aggressive behavior among                       children has focused almost exclusively on the characteristics                  and backgrounds of children who enact the aggression.  In                       contrast, children who serve as victims of peer aggression have                 rarely been studied.  Recent data indicate that a small                         minority of elementary school children (about 10%) serve                        consistently as targets of peer attacks.  These frequently                      victimized children possess certain characteristics, including                  anxiety,submissiveness, a reluctance to fight back, and a                       tendency to display obvious signs of pain and distress.  This                   research is designed to expand our knowledge of the causes and                  consequences of being victimized by aggressive peers.  A                        longitudinal study (beginning when children are in third grade)                 will involve repeatedly measuring children on victimization and                 variables that may be antecedent or consequent to victimization                 (e.g., style of initiating interactions with peers, style of                    handling disputes with peers, loneliness, depression, self--                    esteem).  Data will come from teacher-, peer-, and self-                        reports.  Analyses will attempt to identify the characteristics                 that precede and follow a child being singled out for abuse.                    Other studies will involve directly observing and comparing                     victimized and nonvictimized children's interactions with peers                 on the playground and in the classroom.  These studies are also                 designed to inform us about the behavioral qualities of                         victimized children that contribute to their victimization.                     Results should (a) provide information about the behavioral                     qualities of victimized children that might be targeted in                      intervention programs and (b) further our scientific                            understanding of aggressive processes by informing us about the                 qualities of victims that aggressive children finding provoking                 and reinforcing.",
