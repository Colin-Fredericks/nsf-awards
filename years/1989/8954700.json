 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Children's Museum proposes to develop two versions of an                    interative physical.science exhibit dealing with wave mechanics                 and the related actions of vibrating and oscillation systems.                   One version will be a permanent exhibit that is to be a central                 component in the new science area of the museum, while the other                will be a traveling exhibit that will tour the country under the                auspices of the Association of Science.Technology Centers.  The                 purpose of the exhibit is to heighten the interest of children in               scientific experimentation, with learning taking place at three                 levels including sensory.motor, perceptual.operational and                      intutitive.conceptual.  Materials for teachers will supplement                  the exhibit, and an internship program will train largely                       minority middle.school students in basic concepts and then use                  them as \"explainers\" for the general public.  The request to the                National Science Foundation represents 73% of the total cost of                 the exhibits, with the remainder coming from institutional and                  other sources.",
