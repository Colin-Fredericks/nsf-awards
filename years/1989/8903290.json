 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two main themes highlight this mathematical work.  The first               is a continuing joint effort to analyze properties of the Laplace               operator for compact Riemannian manifolds.  It is the natural                   differential operator which would be used to describe the motion                of the manifold under vibration.  The eigenvalues of the operator               can be viewed as the fundamental frequencies.  The sum of                       negative powers of the eigenvalues is the associated zeta                       function and the derivative of this function (evaluated at zero)                is defined to be the logarithm of the operator.  The manifold is                defined by means of a metric, and the logarithm is called the                   height of the metric. The analysis of the height as a function of               the metric is the main objective of this component of the                       research.  Typical of the questions still unanswered is that of                 finding the hyperbolic structure of a manifold for which the                    height is a minimum.  Closely related to the these questions is                 the fundamental isospectral problem of showing that an                          isospectral set of closed surfaces or plane domains is finite.                  The height function was the basic tool used in showing that                     isospectral sets are compact.  Some type of rigidity result must                now be established to go from compact to finite.                                     The second theme concerns a generalization of the Schwarzian               derivative to conformal metrics and conformal mappings of higher                dimensional Riemannian manifolds.  This derivative measures                     precisely when a function defined in a disc must be univalent.  A               new definition for Riemannian manifolds has been given as a                     symmetric tensor which yields a criterion for locally univalent                 maps from the manifold to a sphere to be globally univalent.                    Some technical assumptions must prevail.  The principal remaining               goal is one of showing that the injectivity condition satisfied                 by the Schwarzian is also necessary.",
