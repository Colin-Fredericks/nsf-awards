 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Joseph J. Torres of the University of South             Florida for collaborative research in marine biology with Dr. A. V.             Aarset of the University of Trondheim, Norway.  They are interested             in the metabolic adaptations of organisms that live under sea-ice in            the Polar regions.  Such adaptations include strictly regulating the            concentration of bodily fluids, tolerating dilution of bodily                   fluids, or some form of compromise between the two.  Dr. Torres will            determine metabolic energy costs for individual amphipods at different          experimental salinities using oxygen electrodes and water-jacketed              respirometers in multiple configuration.  Dr. Aarset will examine               survivorship and hemolymph concentration of these amphipods in                  response to changing salinity.  He will also evaluate their tolerance           of supercooling.  This research will be done at Ny Aalesund, a field            station on Spitsbergen, as part of the Pro Mare Program of Norway.                                                                                              Polar sea-ice is a conspicuous and important feature of the world's             oceans.  A well developed but little studied community of organisms             exists within and beneath this ice.  Gammarid amphipods are the most            important macrofaunal grazers there, and they form a potentially                important trophic link between the ice algae and the fishes living in           the water column below the pack ice.  These small crustaceans must              withstand severe salinity changes caused by seasonal freezing and               thawing of the pack ice.  The proposed research will produce an                 excellent analysis of the adaptive strategies used by several species           of amphipods.",
