 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past 20 years, the satisfactory                                      behavior of many reinforced concrete                                            buildings during damaging earthquakes has                                       been attributed to the presence of structural                                   walls.  Structural walls provide stiffness to                                   the building systems, and control the drift                                     and damage in the buildings.  A critical                                        concern for the design of structural walls in                                   seismic regions has been the specification of                                   reinforcement details to insure ductile                                         response.  The performance of buildings in                                      Vina del Mar during the March 1985 Chilean                                      earthquake appears to contradict professional                                   opinion, because the buildings performed well                                   and the reinforcement details were                                              essentially nonexistent.                                                                                                                                        This research project develops methods for                                      determining the strength, effective                                             stiffness, and deformation capacity of                                          reinforced concrete walls.  Walls are used as                                   the primary lateral-load resisting system in                                    many reinforced concrete structures, yet many                                   fundamental concepts have not been verified                                     experimentally.                                                                                                                                                 The experimental phase of the project                                           involves lateral load tests of reinforced                                       concrete walls.  Major variables include the                                    geometry of the cross section, amount of web                                    reinforcement, type of loading, and amount of                                   confinement reinforcement.  Walls subjected                                     to static load reversals and dynamic loading.                                                                                                                   The analytical phase of the project uses the                                    observed response and the measured response                                     of the experiments to develop a hysteresis                                      model suitable for reproducing nonlinear                                        response in shear and flexure.  Methods are                                     developed to determine the strength, likely                                     mode of failure, and effective stiffness of                                     structural walls during the design process.",
