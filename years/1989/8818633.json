 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of theory of interfacial processes.               During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor                Garrison and her students will apply molecular dynamics techniques              to an understanding of three important areas of surface processes,              namely the molecular beam epitaxial growth of semiconductors, the               etching of silicon surfaces by fluorine, and the interaction of                 energetic (KeV) particles with solid surfaces.  This research,                  which builds on Professor Garrison's accomplishments under NSF                  grant CHE-8713796, represents significant practical applications                of theory to complex, real-world problems of immense technological              importance.  In concert with state-of-the-art experimental studies              of these systems in the laboratories of collaborators, Professor                Garrison's research provides a unique framework both for the                    evaluation of theoretical constructs and for the theoretically                  guided execution of experiments.  Additionally, this project                    offers a unique environment for the training of young theorists                 who will be well-equipped to address challenging problems in                    materials chemistry.                                                                                                                                            This research impacts broadly on the technologically important                  areas of microelectronics fabrication, materials processing, and                surface analysis.",
