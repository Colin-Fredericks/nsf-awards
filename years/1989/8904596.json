 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical and isotopic characteristics of erupted magmas from                regions bounding distinct tetonophysical provinces provide                      insights into relationships between magma generation and                        evolution, crust/mantle evolution, and tectonic development.  the               southwestern United Stated, particularly the Colorado Plateau -                 Basin and Range region, yields opportunities to investigate these               relationships.  Preliminary investigations of mafic lavas from                  the Springerville volcanic field, east-central Arizona, suggest                 that this field marks a portion of the Colorado Plateau - Basin                 and Range transition zone and is underlain by distinct mantle and               crustal reservoirs.  Two mantle sources have been identified, but               elucidation of the nature of interactions between these sources,                or  between  derivative melts, and the characterization of                      additional crustal or mantle reservoir input awaits further                     detailed trace element and multi-isotope investigations.                        This project will build on recently published and acquired field,               petrographic, chronologic, and chemical data through more                       detailed chemical and multi-isotope (Sr,Nd, Pb, O) studies of                   lavas from the entire Springerville compositional spectrum.  The                ultimate goal is to define the character of the subcontinental                  mantle beneath the Springerville portion of the transition zone                 and to define the range of petrogenetic processes acting within                 this region.  This will lead to a more complete understanding of                the effects that the tectonic state of the lithosphere have on                  the nature of mantle reservoir development and interaction, and                 the petrogenetic processes giving rise to chemical and isotopic                 diversity in continental volcanic suites.",
