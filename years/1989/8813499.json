 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Prof. Nancy              Gordon of American University and Dr. Garfield Sadler of the                    University of the West Indies in Jamaica.  The investigators intend             to work on the synthesis of a class of bis (bipyridine) ruthenium               dimers bridged by novel chelating ligands and the characterization              of their spectroscopic and electrochemical properties.  In                      addition, they plan to examine the DNA binding and cleaving                     potential of the various stereoisomers of these complexes.                                                                                                      The project combines the expertise of the two investigators, one in             inorganic electrochemistry and mixed valence dimers, and the other              in transition metal complexes of anthraquinones and bio-organic                 chemistry.  The work has the potential to generate important                    findings iln electron transfer and contribute significantly to a                variety of areas in inorganic chemistry.  Furthermore, the                      biochemical aspects of the research may lead to a better                        understanding of the process of DNA scission.  By combining the                 skills of the two investigators, this award advances the goal of                the Science in Developing Countries Program of increasing                       scientific understanding and strengthening research in a developing             country such as Jamaica.",
