 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ways in which human activities are altering natural processes          of environmental change and the impacts of that change on humans are            not evenly distributed across the globe.  Because of special                    combinations of human and natural attributes, some locales are                  especially prone toward accelerated processes of change induced by              human-environmental interactions.  This project will begin the                  establishment of a methodological framework for the systematic,                 comparative study of human-environmental interactions in five parts of          the world where the situation has been assessed as especially critical          -- the Mexico Basin, part of the Amazon basin, the North Sea, the Aral          Sea, and a part of the Himalayas.  Case studies will be undertaken in           each of these locales to identify and evaluate the human forces that            are altering natural processes of environmental change, the growing             societal awareness of these impacts, and the nature of societal                 responses to those changes.  Common research approaches will be used in         all case studies to ensure comparability of results.  The work will be          coordinated by a central research team of scholars with complementary           skills and by an international board of advisors, but much of the               research will be conducted by scholars based in and familiar with each          of study areas.  The research also will be coordinated with related             activities of study groups of the International Geographic Union.                    This research will lay the groundwork for an important series of           intensive, comparative case studies of human-environmental interaction          in five critical parts of the world.  The research beginning in this            phase of the analysis and likely to continue in future years will               provide significant new insights about human and natural processes in           the study areas themselves, but more importantly, the research will             provide generalizable knowledge about global patterns and processes of          human impacts on and responses to natural environmental change.  The            study will also establish a framework for replication in other locales          in order to further increase understandings about this critical topic.",
