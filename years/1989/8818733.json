 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and operate an Air Cherenkov Telescope                (ACT) at South Pole Station for the purpose of studying discreet                astrophysical sources of very high energy (VHE) gamma rays.  The                instrument will consist of an array of parabolic mirrors, with                  photomultiplier tubes at their foci, which can detect light from                VHE interactions in a small volume of the atmosphere.  The                      experiment will shed light on the origin of cosmic rays and                     possibly on sources of exotic radiation, if such radiation exists.                                                                                              ACT will complement the existing South Pole Air Shower Experiment               (SPASE), and extend downward by two to three orders of magnitude                the energy threshold of SPASE.  SPASE can survey most of the                    southern sky, and ACT will be able to focus on small regions of                 suspected activity.                                                                                                                                             The location at South Pole will allow ACT to view a single object               for extended periods (weeks to months) through a constant                       thickness of atmosphere, while mid-latitude locations allow only a              few hours of viewing at a time of a given object.  Since the                    atmosphere is the detector, the importance of viewing through a                 constant thickness cannot be over emphasized.                                                                                                                   The project is a collaboration of the University of Wisconsin,                  Purdue University, Columbia University, Bartol Research Institute               of the University of Delaware, Smithsonian Astrophysical                        Observatory and the University of Florence (Firenze, Italy).  It                is jointly funded by NSF's Divisions of Polar Programs and                      Physics, the Italian Antarctic Program, the Wisconsin Alumni                    Research Foundation and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.",
