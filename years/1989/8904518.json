 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research utilizes a genetic approach for the alternative                   oxidase to elucidate the regulation of the mitochondrial                        contribution to overall energy and carbon balance.                              Initially, the focus centers on the gene(s) identified as                       encoding at least part of the alternative oxidase.  There is                    a vast amount of physiological data concerning the                              alternative oxidase and so little molecular/genetic data that                   the primary sequence of this oxidase should yield answers                       that cannot be predicted at this time.  The second portion of                   this project utilizes alternative oxidase genes from three                      model systems in order to understand the regulation of                          respiratory electron flow between the cytochrome and                            alternative pathways.%%%                                                                                                                                        Plants, fungi, cyanobacteria and many other organisms possess                   both a normal cytochrome pathway of respiration and another,                    \"alternative\", pathway.  The significance of this pathway in                    relation to total energy and carbon balance in these                            organisms is evident, yet, our biochemical and genetic                          knowledge concerning its identity is extremely limited.                         This research will provide a structural basis for the                           \"alternative oxidase\" of the alternative pathway.  It will                      also elucidate a possible mechanism for the developmental and                   environmentally induced alternative oxidase capacity in plant                   tissues.  A model for the regulation of electron flow between                   the cytochrome and alternative pathways of respiration will                     also be developed, providing a framework for future                             hypotheses concerning the regulation of respiratory electron                    flow as well as a genetic basis through gene manipulation and                   transformation, to test such hypotheses.***//",
