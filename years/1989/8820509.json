 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the most dramatic effects of global climate change of                the next two centuries may be the increased frequency and/or                    intensity of fires in temperate forests.  Natural fire regimes                  are largely unknown, making it difficult to speculate on the                    response of fire regimes to rapid climate change.  The influence                of fire on forest composition and structure might have important                feedback effects on climate through its effects on the cycling of               greenhouse gases.  The last 1000 years provides an example of                   rapid climate change in eastern North America that can serve as a               basis for understanding the role of fire when climate changes.                  Forest transitions may have occurred as a consequence of changes                in the fire regime or changes in the climate.  The null                         hypothesis that the fire regime has not changed across the                      ecotone of deciduous and mixed conifer forest in eastern North                  America during the last 2500 years will be tested.                                   A new method of obtaining long-term fire histories will be                 used in this research.  Individual fires in the stratigraphic                   record will be determined using petrographic thin sections of                   annually laminated (varved) lake sediments to produce long-term                 fire frequencies.  The method will be applied to a network of                   small lakes with varved sediments across our study area.  The                   individual sites will provide a means for assessing the role of                 fire for influencing forest changes in different climatic and                   vegetation settings.  The combined data set will establish the                  broad spatial and temporal patterns of fire regimes and forest                  composition that attend climate change at a subcontinental scale.               Results will facilitate evaluation of future climate change on                  natural ecosystems.",
