 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses an important emerging issue in decision                 making, the growing divergence between technologies developed to                assist in the analysis of complex decisions and the                             appropriateness of the expected utility model as a theoretical                  basis for decision analysis.  The focus of this proposal is a                   conference that will bring together leading practitioners and                   theorists to reassess decision analysis in light of the                         theoretical insights from expected utility theory and behavioral                decision theory.  In addition, the conference will examine the                  implications of empirical findings for the development of new                   decision theory.  The DRMS panel felt that this emphasis                        represented an exciting match of the theory.building and applied                interests of the DRMS program and that the conference represents                an unusual opportunity to provide insights about the nature of                  theory.building, and the relation between descriptive, normative,               and prescriptive insights, in the decision sciences.                            Furthermore, the principal investigator is believed to be                       uniquely qualified to define the agenda and to stimulate                        discussion among the invited participants.  In light of the                     quality of the participants and the timing of the conference, its               results are considered likely to be significant for theorists as                well as practitioners of decision making.",
