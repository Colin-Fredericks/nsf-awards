 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project utilizes the integral equation method to formulate                 and solve several types of multi-domain and thin-body problems in               acoustics.  For the multi-domain problem, the acoustic domain of                interest is interior to a closed surface of arbitrary shape,                    exterior to a closed body, or coupled to another domain.  For the               thin body problem, the acoustic domain is exterior to a body                    whose smallest dimension is of the same order or less than some                 numerical parameter such as element length.  By using integral                  equation methods, all numerical approximations are confined to                  the boundaries of the domains.  There is no need to discretize                  the interior of the domain, and therefore a reduction in the                    computational dimension of the problem by one (three dimensional                problems are solved on the two dimensional boundary of the                      domain), and there is none of the difficulty associated with                    finite element methods, for example, of deciding where in the                   acoustic medium to stop the elements.  It is thereby potentially                simpler and more accurate to solve multi-domain problems using                  integral equations than alternative techniques requiring solution               throughout the domains.  The development of methods for the                     solution of multi-domain and thin-body acoustic problems will be                beneficial to a wide range of specific engineering problems.                    These include the prediction of sound pressure and power radiated               by industrial products such as engines, pumps and compressors                   when partially shrouded by an enclosure for noise control; design               of quiet interiors of vehicles and aircraft; understanding how                  multiple sources may be used in active vibration/active noise                   control; and the design and optimization of complex networks of                 acoustic passageways such as those that occur in the interior of                mufflers, induction systems of engines and silencers for fans.",
