 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be carried out along three separate lines:  1.                    Previous work has shown that the physical state of the amorphous                domains of semicrystalline polymers is widely misunderstood.  The               principal investigator was able to show that these domains have                 the state of a deformed rubber.   It is proposed to further                     develop these arguments, and to attempt to predict the amorphous                domain thickness and the mechanical properties of these systems.                2. The structure factors of certain models of semicrystalline                   polymer chains can be calculated exactly.  The results will be                  compared with experiment.  3. Techniques will be studied for the                computer simulation of the free energy and entropy of dense                     lattice polymer systems.  Such properties cannot be obtained as                 trivially as those that are defined as ensemble averages of                     microscopic properties.  The technique will then be applied to a                number of interesting problems in polymer science, such as                      blends, amorphous domains, and random copolymers.",
