 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in condensed matter              theory between Dr. Catalin Mitescu, Pomona College and Dr. Etienne              Guyon, Ecole Superieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielle, Paris,              France.  The topics of the  joint study are dynamical properties                and time-dependent effects in disordered systems.                                                                                                               Over a decade of research has revealed that heterogeneous, weakly               connected matter is frequently characterized by a large                         distribution of scales, describable in terms of the new, elegant                concepts of fractal geometry.  It has recently become clear that it             is this fractal distribution which sharply controls the transport               properties of multi-phase materials, often invalidating (for weakly             connected matter) the classical, mean-field models for the behavior             of composite materials; these models, in analogy to \"meanfield\"                 approximations, hold that most mechanical and transport properties              are merely suitable averages over an appropriate representative                 volume.  Drs. Mitescu and Guyon propose that a similar                          multiple-scale interpretation must apply to dynamical,                          time-dependent phenomena, which often involve a multiplicity of                 time, not spatial, scales.  They also expect that the existence of              fractal objects will lead to unusual high-frequency effects,                    already theoretically discussed, but as yet little investigated                 experimentally.  Their study of transport phenomena will involve:               (i) fundamental theory of the dynamics of fractal lattices, (ii)                computer simulation of model systems, and (iii) experimental                    investigations on both real materials and synthesized models.                   Specifically, they intend to investigate (a) the permeability or                dispersion in porous media, (b) elastic moduli and vibrational                  modes of heterogeneous solids, (c) nonlinearity effects in random               media, and (d) the manner in which repeated stresses may lead to                internal failure in materials, and affect their observed                        properties.  Both the US and French researchers have made                       substantial contributions to dispersion studies in porous media;                Professor Guyon and his colleagues are among the leading experts in             the field of disordered materials, especially transport and dynamic             properties.",
