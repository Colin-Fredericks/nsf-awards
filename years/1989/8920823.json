The workshop will be held in Washington, D.C. in               October of 1989 and will be organized around three major themes:                                                                                                Molecular biology of plant viruses, viroids and other survival                  elements;                                                                       Soil microorganisms in plant protection; and                                    Engineering of molecular structures in plants and microbes.                                                                                                     Soviet science is particularly strong in the field of virology.  The            younger Soviet scientists are significant organizing forces in the              development of plant molecular biology in the USSR.  The American               contingent is composed of both established investigators and young              scientists recently emerging as leaders in the field.  This joint               workshop will allow the timely interaction of these individuals who             will play a major role in the field of plant molecular biology.",
