 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the fundamental properties of heart cells is their ability               to alter their electrical characteristics in response to neuro-                 hormonal stimulation.  This property allows the heart to adapt                  its physiological function to the range of activity it must meet.               The proposed work focuses upon one ionic channel in the membranes               of mammalian ventricular cardiac muscle cells:  the delayed                     rectifier potassium channel.  This channel contributes outward                  current that regulates the duration of the action potential of                  heart ventricular muscle cells.  Thus, changes in potassium                     current through this channel are critical to maintaining the                    proper relationship between systole (contraction) and diastole                  (filling time)  as heart rate changes.  In addition, because                    calcium ions enter heart cells during the period of                             depolarization of the action potential known as the plateau                     phase, changes in potassium current will indirectly affect                      calcium entry by controlling the action potential duration.  With               prior NSF support, this laboratory has demonstrated that the                    delayed rectifier potassium channel is regulated by two enzyme                  systems (protein kinase A and C) and that this regulation has a                 unique temperature requirement that distinguishes its control                   from that of the cardiac (L-type) calcium channel.  The aim of                  the present proposal is to determine the mechanism(s) by which                  protein kinases A and C regulate the delayed rectifier potassium                channel.  Experiments will be designed to identify differences in               the activity of channels modulated by the two kinase systems.                   Analysis of differences in expressed channel activity will be                   used to test for the location of the sites of protein                           phosphorylation by protein kinase A and protein kinase C.  In                   addition, experiments are proposed to investigate the basis for                 the unique temperature-dependent response of the K channel                      protein to protein kinase stimulation.                                                                                                                          The opening and closing of specific ion channels in a precise                   sequence underlie the electrical activity of heart cells and                    ultimately are responsible for controlling the regular                          contraction and relaxation of the heart.  The results of this                   research will be a more precise understanding of the biochemical                mechanisms regulating one of these specific ion channels, the                   \"delayed rectifier\" potassium channel.  Since similar ion                       channels occur in other cell types including neurons and certain                gland cells, this contribution to our understanding of how ion                  channels are regulated will be of fundamental interest.",
