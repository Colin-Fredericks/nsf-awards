 "awd_abstract_narration": "MHC class II gene expression is modulated during                                differentiation events in B cells and by cellular factors, such                                                                                                 as gamma-interferon in macrophage and fibroblast.  Deciphering                  the molecular mechanisms by which these genes are regulated is                  the next step in understanding how the immune system controls                   its activities.  Since cell bearing class II molecules can                      present antigen to the immune system, the starting point for                    control of the immune response is at the level of MHC gene                      expression.  In this proposal a systematic approach to                          identifying and characterizing the cis-acting regulatory                        elements and their respective trans-acting factors is                           presented.  These experiments will: define the number and                       fundamental properties of the cis-acting elements: compare the                  elements in alpha and beta chain genes; and compare and                         characterize class II-fibroblast, and gamma-interferon-induced                  fibroblast, that interact with these cis-acting elements.                                                                                                       How the immune system in mammals matures and is regulated at                    the gene level is an important fundamental question.  The                       answers, some of which will be obtained by this study, have                     also obvious practical importance.",
