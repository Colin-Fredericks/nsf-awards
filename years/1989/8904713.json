 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will formulate a model for turbidite                         deposition in the Catskill Sea that can resolve important                       problems encountered in modern and ancient submarine fan                        research, in Devonian sea level curves, and in recent sequence                  stratigraphy models.  An additional objective is to resolve the                 present controversy of submarine fan vs. non-fan deposition in                  the Catskill Sea.  PIs will construct a model of 1) deposition                  and flow character for individual, nonchannelized turbidity                     currents and 2) submarine fan development in western New York.                  PIs will study the vertical and lateral variations in the                       sedimentology and stratigraphy of individual sand layers in three               members of the Upper Devonian of western New York.  A pilot                     project demonstrates that the many gorges and ravines in western                New York provide the control necessary to trace individual                      sandstone layers across the region, allowing us to characterize                 the lateral variability in bedforms, texture and thickness of                   individual sandstone layers.  Application of the detailed                       Devonian model to modern and ancient turbidite systems will                     provide insights into their development, thereby resolving some                 of the remaining uncertainties.",
