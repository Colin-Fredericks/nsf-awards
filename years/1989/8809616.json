 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the University of California, Berkeley, in                   cooperation with the University of California, Santa Barbara; the               University of California, Irvine; San Francisco State University;               Stanford University; and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL)                     requests funds to establish a Science and Technology Center in                  Particle Astrophysics.  The Director of the Center will be                      Professor Bernard Sadoulet of the University of California,                     Berkeley.                                                                                                                                                       Astronomical evidence indicates that 90% or more of the universe                is made of dark matter.  Elucidating the nature of this matter                  has the highest priority in astrophysics and forms the                          intellectual focus of the research in the Center.  The most                     intriguing possibility is that this matter may be in the form of                particle relics from the beginning of the universe.                             Concentrations of these particles could surround us today in the                form of dark matter in galaxy halos, and their signature may                    exist in the diffuse cosmic background radiation which itself                   originates from the early universe.  Dark matter and the diffuse                background radiation provide unique laboratories for studying                   both the origin of the universe and the fundamental nature of                   matter. Central to the research program is the development of a                 new generation of cryogenic detectors which can be used to                      measure more accurately the diffuse background radiation and to                 verify directly the particle origin hypothesis of dark matter.                                                                                                  Another clue to the origin of dark matter may lie in the details                of the large scale structure of the universe.  Research at the                  Center will include the development of advanced optical methods                 for this study including the development of an adaptive optics                  system for the new Keck Telescope.  If successful, the importance               of this high-resolution system for all of astronomy cannot be                   overemphasized, while the impact on the optical industry will be                quite direct.",
