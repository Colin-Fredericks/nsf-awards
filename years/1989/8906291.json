 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently plant population biologists have recognized the                importance of maternal effects in plants, that is, the                          transmission of traits from a plant to its seed offspring through               means other than normal chromosomal inheritance.  Drs. Schmitt                  and Wulff propose to investigate one such maternal effect, the                  effect of a plant's environment on the relative success of its                  offspring, in natural populations of the common lawn and pasture                weed, \u001aPlantago\u001a\u001a\u001a \u001alanceolata\u001a (ribwort plantain).  By propagating             clones of individual plants and planting them into different                    environments, then crossing them and collecting their seeds, the                investigators will be able to determine how parental environment                affects offspring traits such as seed size and germination rate,                while controlling the genetic background of the parent across                   environments.  By planting these seed progeny back into the same                experimental sites, the investigators will be able to determine                 how parental environment affects offspring success.                                     The proposed research will make several contributions to the            field of plant population biology.  First, it will provide unique               data on the magnitude of environmental maternal effects                         generated by environmental heterogeneity within and between                     natural populations.  Second, this will be the first study to                   investigate the impact of environmental maternal effects on                     offspring fitness under natural conditions.  The findings will be               important both for studies of plant population dynamics and seed                demography and for understanding the evolution of seed and                      seedling traits within natural populations.  This work will also                have implications for applied plant biology because \u001aPlantago\u001a                  \u001alanceolata\u001a is a common weed and because environmental maternal                effects are undoubtedly important in many crop species.",
