 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957-8                  Professor Keeling of Scripps Institution of Oceanography                        initiated a high precision atmospheric carbon dioxide                           measurements program at Mauna Loa, Hawaii to study the                          biogeochemical carbon cycle.  This measurement program has been                 continued and expanded since that time.  In the early 1960's                    the data set available from this program demonstrated                           conclusively that the carbon dioxide concentration in the                       atmosphere was increasing at a rate of approximately a third of                 one percent per year.   This increase in atmospheric carbon                     dioxide is caused primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels.                  Since carbon dioxide is a \"greenhouse gas\" it is expected that                  within a few decades its increased atmospheric concentration                    will lead to climatic changes.  Among the central issues of the                 carbon dioxide question is the reliability of predictions of                    future concentrations.  Such predictions require an                             understanding of the biogeochemical carbon dioxide sink and                     source strengths.                                                                    In this research project emphasis will be on the                           measurement of the carbon isotopic composition of carbon                        dioxide in the atmosphere and oceans as a function of space and                 time.  Additionally, high precision measurements of dissolved                   carbon                                                                          dioxide will be made at key locations in surface and subsurface                 ocean water.  These, and supporting chemical measurements, will                 be used to help evaluate the oceans ability to absorb carbon                    dioxide released to the atmosphere by the combustion of fossil                  fuels.",
