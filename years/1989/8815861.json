 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study is proposed of the importance of the colonization                  process in the coexistence of the two most abundant pioneer tree                species (Cecropia obtusifolia and Heliocarpus appendiculatus)                   growing in the tropical rain forest of Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz                    (Southeast Mexico).  Both the patch dynamics of the forest and                  the seed population dynamics of each species are considered.                    Demographic tools are used to fulfill this objective and the                    following questions are addressed: 1.-What is the temporal and                  spatial pattern of gap formation? and what are the transition                   probabilities of the different types of patches in the forest of                Los Tuxtlas?  2.-What is the spatial and temporal pattern of seed               rain of Cecropia obtusifolia and Heliocarpus appendiculatus at                  ground level in Los Tuxtlas?  3.-How does seed predation,                       germination and physiological death affect the species soil seed                dynamics of each species in different types of forest patches?                  4.-How does the patch dynamics and the seed population dynamics                 of each species affect their relative abundance of seeds during                 the process of gap colonization?  5.-How sensitive are the seed                 population dynamics to alterations of the ecological variables                  that determine them?  6.-How does the relative availability of                  propagules determine the future relative success of each species                at the seedling and juvenile stage in particular gaps?  Answers                 to these questions will contribute to understanding some of the                 mechanisms governing the coexistence of so many tree species in                 the tropics.",
