 "awd_abstract_narration": "Critical to the development of the industrial might of the United               States was the development of an iron-making industry as good as                or better than any in the world.  Development of the capacity to                make wrought iron of adequate quality and in sufficient                         quantitities to supply American industries that were making                     boilers, steam engines, rails, edge tools, arms, structural iron                for buildings and ship hulls, was an essential step toward the                  attainment of industrial maturity in the United States.  Yet the                capcity to make such wrought iron was not easily acquired.  The                 replacement of iron by steel was well underway before American                  ironmakers achieved the technological maturity to compete with                  imports in quality as well as in quantity.  Professor Gordon is                 studying how this technological maturity was achieved through one               way of making wrought iron: the bloomery process.  He will use                  archaeometallurgical methods and historical sources to                          investigate the evolution of American technology for the direct                 reduction of ore to iron in the 19th century.  The research will                focus on the American bloomery process practiced in the                         Adirondack region of New York State because bloom smelting                      reached its highest level of technological development there.  He               will utilize the results being obtained by several historians                   and historical archaeologists now working on the records and                    physical remains of the iron industry in northwestern New York.                 The results will be used to show how American ironmasters brought               the direct reduction process to a high level of technological                   maturity through experience, the application of science, and the                development of skills by metallurgical artificers.  They will                   also be used in a comparative study of bloom smelting technology                in other parts of the world aimed at the resolution of technical                questions about alternative ways fo carrying on the direct                      reduction process now being debated by archaeometallurgists.",
