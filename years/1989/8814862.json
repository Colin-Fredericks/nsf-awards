 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry                        Program supports research in the area of organometallic                         catalysis. In this project William H. Hersh of the University                   of California at Los Angeles will investigate the chemical                      synthesis and reactivity of mono- and di-functional metal                       clusters. These cluster molecules are potential catalysts for                   carbon-carbon bond formation which is an important process in                   organic synthesis and especially in the production of                           petrochemicals from non-petroleum feedstocks. In addition the                   clusters may serve as model compounds for understanding the                     mechanisms of reactions at the surface of metals.                                                                                                               Heteronuclear bi- and tri-metallic cluster molecules containing                 either molybdenum and iron or manganese and iron will be                        synthesized, using bridging carbyne or acyl groups and                          ancillary ligands such as cyclopentadienide and carbon                          monoxide. The reactions of these clusters will be studied,                      including the isomerization of a bridging methoxycarbyne to a                   bridging acyl via methyl migration to one of the metal atoms of                 the cluster. Difunctional clusters will also be synthesized,                    and reactions in which two organic substituents on different                    metals of the cluster join via carbon-carbon bond formation                     will be investigated. Special emphasis will be placed on the                    kinetics and mechanisms of these reactions.                                     studied.",
