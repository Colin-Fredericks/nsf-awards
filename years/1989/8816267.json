 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to integrate a three-                       dimensional model of the geodynamo by using a novel numerical                   method.  In common with most current research, the Earth's fluid                core will be represented by a convecting Boussinesq fluid.                      Traditional numerical methods cannot, by many orders of                         magnitude, simulate the effects of the large rotational                         (Coriolis) force that so potently affects the convective regime                 of the core; the new method promises to represent them within an                order of magnitude.  The new procedure, which depends on an                     unusual choice of computational grid, has been tested on so-                    called \"intermediate models\" of the geodynamo, which are                        axisymmetric over-idealizations of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)               of the core, and has been found to perform well.  The next                      logical step is to include geophysically realistic (i.e.                        dynamically determined) asymmetries.  The new integrations will                 hopefully help settle one of the central issues of geodynamo                    theory of this decade: whether or not the MHD of the core is                    controlled at the core-mantle boundary.",
