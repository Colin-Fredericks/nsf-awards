 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mass of a system inferred from the motions of its member                    galaxies is different (usually smaller) than that inferred from                 the observed radiation.  This discrepancy is generally attributed               to the presence of dark matter in the system.  Such a model                     requires that the system galaxies (the source galaxies) merge                   with one another to form a single product galaxy. The predicted                 time-scale for this event manifests itself as a ratio of the                    number of product galaxies to the number of source galaxies in a                given volume of space.  Studies of binary-supergiant galaxies and               compact groups of galaxies suggest that the predicted product-to-               source ratio may be smaller by a factor exceeding ten than that                 actually observed.  Analyses for these systems are to be refined                by means of more sophisticated techniques whose application is                  warranted by new data.  Tests of the universality of the effect                 require statistical homogeneous samples of different types of                   systems.  These are to be identified through application of                     dendrogram techniques.",
