 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the general acceptance of the electroweak theory and                  quantum chromodynamics, there remains one barrier in theoretical                physics to the ideal of the unification of all of the forces of                 nature:  the basic incompatibility of the philosophy and                        techniques of quantum field theory with those of general                        relativity.  The term quantum gravity has been coined to refer to               attempts to resolve the incompatibility of these two theories,                  but no one is sure exactly what should be meant by this term.                   Many different approaches are being tried, with differing and                   sometimes contradictory philosophies.  Three different projects                 are being pursued by Professor Manogue, incorporating three of                  these philosophies.                                                                  In the new research program initiated by this ROW award,                   Professor Manogue will work on the description of fundamental                   superstrings, explore the effect of moving boundaries on the                    creation of particles and examine the effect of possible quantum                fluctuations on the topology of spacetime.",
