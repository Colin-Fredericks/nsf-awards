 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is for support of a workshop                                        planned for the San Francisco Bay area on                                       November 9 and 10, 1989.  The purpose of the                                    workshop is to discuss procedures used to                                       characterize the dynamic behavior of soil for                                   seismic design and analysis.  The workshop is                                   being supported jointly with the Electric                                       Power Research Institute (EPRI).                                                                                                                                The workshop will address two topics: (1)                                       methods for estimating the dynamic properties                                   of soil in situ, at levels of strain                                            appropriate for use in earthquake design and                                    analysis, and (2) methods for quantifying the                                   spatial variability of these dynamic soil                                       properties.  The workshop participants are to                                   be chosen for their knowledge and expertise                                     in the areas of either (1) field and                                            laboratory characterization of dynamic soil                                     properties, or (2) use of field and                                             laboratory properties in seismic modeling.                                      The format for the workshop will include a                                      series of state-of-the-technology                                               presentations, focusing on procedures                                           currently used in North America, Europe, and                                    Asia to estimate dynamic soil properties in                                     situ, including their spatial variability. A                                    series of panel discussions will address                                        specific issues related to dynamic property                                     measurement and overall site                                                    characterization, and these will be presented                                   at plenary sessions.                                                                                                                                            The product of the workshop will be a                                           document that identifies uncertainties and                                      needs in the areas of dynamic soil property                                     measurement and overall site characterization                                   for seismic design and response analysis: it                                    will also provide a guide to topics and                                         priorities meriting special studies.",
