 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project gives Chemistry and Geology students laboratory               experience in the use of high performance (HPLC) and ion                        chromatography (IC), two widely used analytical methods.  HPLC                  has become the method-of-choice for the separation and                          quantitative determination of small amount of many non-volatile                 or thermally labile compounds in a variety of matrices such as                  pharmaceutical and environmental samples.  IC is a rapidly                      growing method that is especially well-suited to the                            determination of anions.  The combination HPLC/IC instrument                    along with a microcomputer gives students hands-on experience in                both methods.  IR and thin layer chromatography are use to                      identify the alkaloids and choose the optimum solvent system.                   The computer data system collects HPLC/IC data and creates data                 files for export to other software systems.  IC is used to                      determine several anions in natural water samples or food                       extracts.  The effects of solvent modification on IC is                         demonstrated and the comparison with other methods of anion                     analysis is preformed.  The institution is matching the NSF grant               with an equal amount of funds.",
