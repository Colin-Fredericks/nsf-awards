 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal is concerned with the efficient implementation           of the Icon programming language.                                                                                                                               The main problems are:                                                                                                                                            o  The generation of efficient code for expressions in Icon, which                 may produce sequences of results and perform goal-directed                      evaluation with novel control structures.                                                                                                                    o  The detection and handling at compile-time of operations that                   otherwise would have to be dealt with at run-time.                                                                                                           o  The representation of a wide variety of data and aggregates of                  data with sophisticated access mechanisms.                                                                                                                   o  The dynamic allocation and collection of space for such data over               a range of computer architectures.                                                                                                                         These problems will be approached by designing conceptual models,               developing algorithms, and implementing the results.  Tools for                 measuring the performance of the results will be developed and used in          conjunction with design and implementation.                                                                                                                     The goals of this research are: (1) to provide a production-quality             implementation of Icon, which will be valuable in its own right, (2) to         provide fundamental insights into implementation techniques for such            programming languages, and (3) to provide models, algorithms, and tools         for such implementations.",
