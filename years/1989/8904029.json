 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators (PI) will develop and study new                non- probabilistic models to analyze the behavior of control                    algorithms for resource allocation in packet switched data                      communications networks.  Their approach to dealing with                        uncertainty differs from traditional approaches.  Rather than                   specifying statistical properties of traffic they plan to employ                and extend a non- probabilistic model for demand that specifies                 hard constraints satisfied by the traffic.  The model facilitates               the rigorous computation of bounds for parameters such as maximum               delay, average delay, and buffering requirements in networks.                   They will focus on dynamic routing and flow control which involve               the study of coupled queues.  The use of models such as the                     nonprobabilistic model is likely to overcome the analytical                     problems traditionally encountered.  They provide examples of                   problems that address these issues in networks using point to                   point and interacting broadcast links.  As the size and demand                  for data networks grow, the economic impact of developing useful                tools for engineering them will be quite significant.  This                     approach develops some of these tools. ***//",
