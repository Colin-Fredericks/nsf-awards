 "awd_abstract_narration": "The requirements for motion control and for high efficiency drives              have increased dramatically in industrial applications such as                  automated manufacturing and robotics.  The recent advances in                   power electronic devices, magnetic materials in electric motors,                and in control systems theory as implemented with the use of                    microprocessors and VLSI circuits, have allowed the development of              such drives.  An improvement plan for the recently established                  laboratory in electrical machines and drives will shift the                     emphasis from the characteristics of isolated electrical machines               to the concept of a drive consisting of a collection of hardware                and software.  The new equipment required for this project                      includes new types of electrical machines, modern power electronic              drives (rectifiers and inverters), accurate sensors for                         measurement and control, and computers to control the experiments               and collect and analyze data.  With this equipment, the                         experiments in the laboratory will allow the student to study the               drive characteristics and use knowledge from such diverse areas as              energy conversion, digital systems, or control theory to analyze                and design a motion control system.  These equipment will be also               used for the laboratory section of the power electronics course.",
