 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the years, empirical research on juries has focused almost                 exclusively on the criminal jury.  Very little is known about                   decisionmaking by juries in civil litigation.  This is                          unfortunate since the role of the jury in civil litigation is a                 matter of ongoing debate.  Critics claim that civil juries are                  unpredictable, inequitable, and incapable of coping with complex                litigation.  Recent legistive proposals for modifying the civil                 jury system are predicated on untested assumptions about jury                   behavior.                                                                                                                                                       This study will identify and test some important empirical                      questions about decisionmaking by civil juries in the area of                   personal injury cases.  There is some indication that civil jury                verdicts in personal injury cases are less favorable for                        organizational defendants than for individual defendants.                       Critics cite this pattern in support of the hypothesis that                     jurors are influenced by the defendant's financial resources,                   labelling it a \"Deep Pockets\" effect.  However, there are a                     number of alternative explanations for this defendant identity                  effect.  This project will conduct three mock jury experiments to               attempt to replicate the defendant identity effect and to test                  competitively several alternative models in order to better                     understand the norms and values that underly jurors' liability                  and compensation judgments in tort litigation.  The first two                   experiments will examine individual juror judgments using written               trial scenarios, while the third experiment will replicate and                  extend the results of those studies using deliberating mock                     juries and a realistic videotaped trial reenactment.                                                                                                            This research will yield a rich and diverse collection of data on               civil juror and jury decision processes which will add to our                   knowledge about juror judgment in personal injury cases.  Not                   only will the testing of alternative theoretical models expand                  scientific knowledge in this area, but a better understanding of                the basis for jury verdicts will contribute to a more informed                  policy debate.  In addition, the deliberation content analyses                  will help to identify ways in which trial procedures can be                     improved to assist citizens, jurors, and perhaps judges in                      tackling the complexity and uncertainty of fact-finding in civil                litigation.  Of broader social psychological relevance, the                     research will permit examination of relatively unexplored                       attributional issues and the factors that influence the relative                salience of distributive justice norms.",
