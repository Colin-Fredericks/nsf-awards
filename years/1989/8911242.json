 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Hislop's project in mathematical physics will                    investigate the resonances of Schrodinger operators with                        periodic potentials and an external electric field, and the                     relation between resonances and the meromorphic structure of the                S-matrix for these and more general two- and N-body Stark                       Hamiltonians. (As used here, the term resonance refers to a pole                of the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent of an operator                 through the continuous spectrum.) The techniques involved include               commutator methods, semiclassical analysis, and geometric                       resolvent equations. These techniques will also be used to study                the spectrum of the Laplacian on a class of non-compact                         hyperbolic manifolds. Geometric conditions will be sought                       implying the absence of eigenvalues and the exponential decay of                eigenfunctions.                                                                       The research here envisioned involves the analysis of                     sophisticated mathematical techniques for the modeling of                       physical systems, especially at the microscopic level where                     intuition can lead one astray. Instead of representing physical                 quantities by numbers, one is forced to use instead functions and               operators on spaces of functions. The Hamiltonian of a system is                an operator that corresponds roughly to energy. Its spectrum is a               set of real numbers defined mathematically that have the physical               interpretation of possible energy levels of the system. Physics                 and mathematics play off one another in analyzing the spectrum of               a given class of Hamiltonians. Another context in which operators               arise naturally is geometry. Any surface (or higher-dimensional                 analogue) on which coordinates can be assigned in a sufficiently                smooth manner has associated to it an operator called the                       Laplacian. (In the case of a surface, the spectrum of the                       Laplacian may be thought of as giving frequencies of natural                    modes of vibration.) Professor Hislop will investigate the                      spectral theory of geometrically defined operators using                        techniques developed in the mathematical physics part of his                    project.",
