 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work deals with application of parallel                       processing to communication systems problems, mostly with                       particular regard to implementation with the INMOS transputer                   device. There are three major areas with quite distinct                         objectives: (1) development of a high-speed simulator for                       analysis of digital communication systems, (2) investigation of                 new architecture ( generalized lattice) for implementation of                   digital filters, and (3) reformulation of signal processing                     algorithms typically used in communication systems ( least                      squares estimation, Kalman filtering, sequential decoding, etc.)                for a more direct and efficient implementation as a form of                     systolic array. The objective of area (1) is to provide an                      effective analysis tool for designers of complex communication                  systems by virtue of the high computational speeds afforded by                  parallel processors. Areas (2) and (3) have similar objectives                  and represent an investigation of a more fundamental nature. The                goal is to show ways to implement sophisticated signal processing               operations (such as; bandpass filtering, Viterbi detection,                     adaptive channel equalization)  at high speed so that                           communication channels can be utilized more efficiently. Another                benefit of this work is the development of design tools for using               an exisiting device ( the transputer) for implementing common                   signal processing operations.",
