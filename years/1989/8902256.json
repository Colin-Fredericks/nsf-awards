 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides supplementary travel support to                        Professor Douglas Pickrell, who now holds a Mathematical Sciences               Postdoctoral Research Fellowship.                                                    His project is part of an effort now underway in many                      quarters to extend concepts and results long familiar in the                    study of Lie groups to objects of a much more exotic sort. An                   example of a Lie group in the usual sense is the group of all                   rotations of a sphere, where the group operation consists of                    following one motion by another. Detailed knowledge of the                      rotation group is extremely helpful in the analysis of any                      mathematical or physical situation where spherical symmetry is                  present. It is an important feature of this group that we need                  only a finite number of parameters (in this case three) to                      specify any of its members. If now instead of rigid motions we                  look at all smooth transformations (diffeomorphisms) of the                     sphere, the situation becomes infinite-dimensional. Such groups                 of diffeomorphisms are typical of the structures that Professor                 Pickrell will focus on in his research. Many of the same                        questions that make sense in the traditional setting also make                  sense infinite-dimensionally, but the intellectual tools that                   must be used in answering them are radically different. Recent                  developments in theoretical physics do much to set the agenda and               provide insight in this new area of mathematical research.",
