 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposed research is to improve our                  understanding of certain aspects of the mechanisms responsible                  for tropical intraseasonal oscillation.  The complex dynamic                    framework will be reduced to a group of tractable models that can               be solved separately either by analytic means or by use of quasi-               analytic model and numerical computation.  The investigation will               focus on (1) the couplings between equatorial Kelvin and Rossby                 waves and among internal vertical modes through moist processes;                (2) the roles of boundary layer mass and moisture convergence in                the dynamics of the low frequency wave; (3) the consequences of                 nonlinear versus linear heating representation; (4) the causes of               regionally and seasonally northward phase propagation; and (5)                  the nature of air-sea interaction in the intraseasonal time scale               and the impact of this interaction on tropical low frequency                    variations.                                                                          This research is important because it seeks to understand                  the physical mechanisms responsible for a small but significant                 portion of the observed climate variability in the tropics;                     variability which may act as a trigger for larger amplitude                     climate variability.",
