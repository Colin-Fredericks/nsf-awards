 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by ten U.S.                   scientists in an U. S.-India seminar-workshop on viroids and                    diseases of uncertain etiology, to be held in New Delhi, India                  November 15-28, 1989.  The Indian cooperating scientist is                      Dr. S. P. Raychaudhuri, Chairman of the International Union of                  Forestry Research Organization-Virus and Mycoplasma Diseases.                   The objectives include exchange of information on new                           techniques for isolating and characterizing viroids associated                  with diseases of tropical plants, and the testing of some of                    these techniques on diseases of uncertain etiology.  The                        participants are expected to identify areas where cooperative                   research would be beneficial to the U.S. and India.                                                                                                             Scope:  The U. S. and Indian directors of this seminar-workshop                 are among world leaders in the study of plant diseases in                       particular, and microbiology in general.  The expertise and                     techniques available in the U. S. of viroids and their                          characteristics would benefit and be sharpened from                             applications to viroid diseases known to occur in India, such                   as potato spindle tuber, citrus exocortis and other diseases                    for which no certain cause is identified.  Some of these                        diseases can be economically significant if transmitted to the                  U. S. Thus cooperative research and exchange of information in                  this field will be of value to science and to  the agricultural                 industry in the two countries.",
