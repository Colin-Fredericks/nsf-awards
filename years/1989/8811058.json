 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate pore fluid and sediment                           geochemistry of shallow marine carbonate sediments from Florida                 Bay in order to assess their significance as recycling sites                    for calcium carbonate and organic matter.  Results of a pilot                   study suggest that, contrary to prior assumptions, significant                  carbonate dissolution occurs in sediment pore fluids, driven by                 carbonic acid liberated from organic matter oxidation during                    sulfate reduction.  The expanded investigation will evaluate                    this process across a wider range of environments and water                     depths than were accessible in the pilot study.  The pore fluid                 chemistry (emphasis on Ca/Cl, degree of sulfate reduction, and                  carbonic acid system parameters) will be determined and sulfate                 reduction rates measured experimentally.  Sediment organic                      carbon contents and carbon isotopic compositions of pore fluids                 will be determined to better constrain controls and                             consequences of sulfate reduction.  Results will provide a                      rigorous assessment of the role shallow carbonate shelf                         deposits play in the oceanic cycles of calcium carbonate and                    organic matter.                                                                 %%%                                                                                                                                                             The dissolution of calcium carbonate has long been thought to                   occur in deep water.  The results of the pilot project,                         however, prove that much dissolution occurs in shallow water.                   This project will collect sedimentary cores from Florida Bay                    and begin geochemical analyses of the sediments immediately                     after their collection.  This study will expand the knowledge                   of this important geochemical process to a new environment at                   greater depth to examine the role of other environmental                        parameters on the process.",
