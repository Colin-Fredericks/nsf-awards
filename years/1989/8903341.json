 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is analyze experimentally the actions and         interactions of cell organelles and regions that are required for animal        cell division.  Normal and chemically treated cleaving eggs and dividing        cultured vertebrate tissue cells will be used in experiments in which           their shapes are changed, parts are removed and substances are injected.        In animal cell division the mitotic apparatus (which also sorts and             transports chromosomes) establishes a superficial contractile ring that         constricts the cell into separate parts.  The results of the experiments        will yield information concerning: (1) The geometrical relations between        the mitotic apparatus and the surface needed for cell division, (2) the         nature of the immediate response of the surface to themitotic apparatus,        (3) the time relations of the furrow establishment process,(4) the              relation between the contractile ring and the surface, and (5)polar body        formation.  The cell division process is essential for the normal               development and maintenance of animals, including man. The aspects of           the process to be studied are fundamental, and expanded knowledge of it         should increase the possibilities of control, as well as enhance                understanding.",
