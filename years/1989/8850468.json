The six-week institutes in this thirty month program           will be conducted by visiting scientists and science educators as well          as faculty from East Tennessee State University.  After a renewal of            teacher's expertise in elementary school science content and methodology        teachers will be expected to acquire the ability to organize and conduct        workshops across the region and workshop across the region and work with        peer teachers in their home schools.                                                                                                                            An amount equivalent to 29 percent of the NSF award is being contributed        as cost-sharing.",
