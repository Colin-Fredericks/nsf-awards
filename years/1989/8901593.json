 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program, John E. Bercaw of the Calif-                  ornia Institute of Technology will investigate the synthesis                    and properties of new types of dioxygen-compatible transition                   metal compounds which may be capable of selectively oxidizing                   hydrocarbons. The eventual aim of this research is to develop a                 useful catalytic method for converting hydrocarbons from coal,                  petroleum or natural gas sources to alcohols (in particular,                    methane to methanol), which may be more readily transportable                   and useful energy sources or chemical feedstocks.                                                                                                               The project has two thrusts: (1) synthesis of new soluble oxo                   or peroxo derivatives of ruthenium, which could smoothly                        convert olefins to epoxides or carbonyl compounds and hydro-                    carbons to alcohols, and (2) mechanistic studies which involve                  carbon-oxygen bond formation or carbon-oxygen bond cleavage at                  hafnium and tantalum. The latter project would lead to an                       understanding of the kinetic and thermodynamic factors                          influencing carbon-oxygen and hydrogen-oxygen bond formation at                 transition metal centers which would aid in design of the                       catalysts in part (1). Related studies are also proposed which                  could provide some model compounds and transformations of                       relevance to catalytic hydrodesulfurization chemistry.",
