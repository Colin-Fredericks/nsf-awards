 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will examine the changes in                  the status of women in the context of an ongoing social                         revolution in Nicaragua.  The official propaganda of social                     revolutions is often to destroy gender biases, but the actual                   reality is that such biases endure in particular configurations                 depending on the cultural history of the place.  This project                   will interview officials in agrarian reform and family farmers on               the gender division of labor as well as changes in women's roles                in general.  Methods will include archival research, intensive as               well as survey interviewing, and participant observation.                                                                                                       This research is important because Central America is a vitally                 important part of the hemisphere, and understanding of the                      cultural and social changes going on there can help policy                      in the US formulate reasonable actions in the face of the                       revolutionary changes the region is experiencing.  In addition,                 the changes in gender roles in all societies of the world are                   significant, and understanding of how these changes are affected                by local official policy and by local custom is crucial to                      helping us deal with problems related to gender roles.",
