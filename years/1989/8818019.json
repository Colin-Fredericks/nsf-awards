 "awd_abstract_narration": "The question of whether local adaptation by leaf feeding                   herbivores occurs at the small scale of individual plant                        genotypes and how recombination and the introduction of new                     alleles through sexual reproduction affect local adaptation by                  both plant and insect will be examined.  The host plant, Erigeron               glaucus, is a long-lived, mat forming plant that produces both                  apomictic seeds and outcrossed seeds.  The herbivore, a thrips                  Apterothrips secticornis, goes through many generations each year               and produces offspring either asexually or sexually.  The mode of               reproduction (sexual vs. asexual) of both the plant and the                     herbivore can be experimentally manipulated.  Previous work                     showed that population growth of thrips was very strongly                       affected by host plant variation.  Conversely, preliminary                      evidence indicates that thrips can reduce seed production of                    their hosts.  To determine if thrips show local adaptation to                   individual hosts, the population growth of genetic lines derived                from thrips on five different host clones will be compared.  If                 adaptation to individual clones has taken place, then thrips from               each clone may be expected to perform best on the clone from                    which their ancestors were taken.  A preliminary run of this                    experiment suggested that thrips have adapted to individual                     plants.  If thrips have adapted to host genetic lines, can hosts                escape their parasites by reproducing sexually?  This question                  will be answered by comparing the population growth of thrips on                plants that were produced apomictically versus those that were                  produced by outcrossing.  Similarly, the role of mode of                        reproduction, in the success of thrips on host plant lines by                   using parthenogenetically-produced or sexually-produced thrips                  progeny will be examined.",
