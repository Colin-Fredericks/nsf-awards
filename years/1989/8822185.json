 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. McGovern and his colleagues will continue to conduct                        archaeological excavations at the large and deeply stratified                   farm midden site of Svalbard and other related sites in Iceland.                Adopting a broad scale approach, he will uncover the outlines of                homestead buildings and through the recovery of faunal, floral,                 and other artifactual remains, study the subsistence adaptation                 of Norse inhabitants of Iceland.  He will supplement these data                 with ethnographic and documentary research and employ                           paleoenvironmental data to reconstruct adaptation against a                     backdrop of changing environmental conditions.                                                                                                                  Between 800.1000 AD, Viking.age Scandinavian populations spread                 into the islands of the North Atlantic taking with them a well                  developed seafaring tradition and a subsistence economy based                   upon domestic animals and some cereals.  As they moved into new                 regions they adapted this to include wild resources which were                  readily available.  Archaeology in Iceland can shed light on this               adaptive process and is especially interesting because it                       provides insight into how human populations cope in marginal                    environments.  Beginning ca. 1250 AD a significant climatic                     cooling known as the \"Little Ice Age\" began.  This affected the                 Viking colonies and placed great stress on local populations.                   The Svalbard site is particularly interesting because it                        documents this period and the data which Dr. McGovern recovers                  will provide insight into how human populations adapt to severe                 climatic stress.  Because faunal and floral material is so well                 preserved, detailed subsistence reconstruction will be possible.",
