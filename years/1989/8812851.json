 "awd_abstract_narration": "An advanced laser fluorescence apparatus is employed to determine the           surface or translational diffusion coefficients of fluorescent-labeled          probes in monomolecular films at air-water interfaces using                     fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.  The effects of molecular           packing, temperature, and various ions on the translational mobility            in single and double hydrocarbon-chain surfactant systems are                   investigated.  The fluorescence-recovery-after-photobleaching approach          avoids many of the problems associated with the radiotracer technique           for measuring surface diffusion.  This experimental technique also              permits one to extend the study of surface diffusion to interfacial             systems previously inaccessible to study by the radiotracer method.             In addition, one is able to distinguish between flow and diffusional            transport processes occurring in monomolecular films.  The procedure            provides, for the first time, reliable experimental values of the               surface diffusion coefficient to test a recently developed theoretical          model of surface diffusion and to elucidate the nature of two-                  dimensional mass transfer at fluid/fluid interfaces.                                                                                                            The results of this research have applicability to a wide range of              areas, including pulp and paper processing.  Reliable values of the             surface diffusion coefficient are needed for use in a variety                   capillary waves and the stability of thin films which, in turn, are             very important to evaluating and understanding foam problems in the             pulp and paper industry.  Surface mobility is important in the                  stability of foam; however, experimental determinations of this                 parameter are virtually nonexistent.  This research on interfacial              mass transfer is directed to overcoming this serious limitation; when           combined with interfacial rheological measurements, it will assist in           advancing the understanding of foams and the development of improved            foam inhibitors and foam breakers.",
