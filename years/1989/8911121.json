 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research on methods that are extremely useful            for rigorously analyzing economic dynamics, strategic behavior and              social choice.  The specific research topics are (1) the nature of              equilibrium in repeated games where actions are not observable or where         there is a mixture of long- and short-run players; (2) renegotiation-           proof equilibria in repeated games; (3) Markov equilibrium; and (4)             implementation theory.                                                                                                                                          The research on repeated games is important because the Folk Theorem,           one of the most widely used methods for finding mathematical                    solutions to repeated games, depends on the assumption that players             observe a relationship between the actions of the other players and the         outcomes of the games.  The purpose of the project is to study the              nature of equilibrium in repeated games when the outcomes observed by           the players are imperfectly correlated.                                                                                                                         In a repeated game, cooperation derives from the potential of players           to punish non-cooperative behavior.  This threat of punishment breaks           down, if agents can avoid the punishment by renegotiation.  The project         continues to study ways of finding equilibria in repeated games that            are renegotiation-proof.  This line of research is very important               because imposing a requirement that equilibria be renegotiation-proof           reduces the number of possible outcomes to repeated games in this way           enabling economic theorists to make more precise predictions about the          outcomes of dynamic economic processes.                                                                                                                         The project's research on Markov strategies offers another way of               reducing the number of possible outcomes of dynamic economic models.            The research is based on the idea that strategies depend on only a              small set of relevant past variables rather than on the entire history          of the game.  This project formulates for the first time a general              definition of these restricted or Markov strategies and studies their           characteristics.                                                                                                                                                Implementation theory is concerned with the question of when it is              possible to design a game or \"mechanism\" whose equilibria have                  properties that are desirable with respect to a given criterion of              social welfare.  Traditional implementation theory assumes that the             outcome can be enforced by a central authority.  This project extends           implementation theory to situations where some individuals' actions             cannot be observed by anyone else.                                                                                                                              This project should be supported because it makes fundamental                   contributions to economic theory.  Economic analysis has been hindered          by the fact that many dynamic economic models have huge sets of                 equilibria.  The results of this research could enable theorists to             make more discriminating forecasts of the outcomes of these models.",
