 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is on developing fault-tolerant                  architectures and algorithms for processor arrays.  The computational           loads of these systems are assumed to alternate between two phases: a           strict phase that is characterized by a heavy load and strict                   constraints on response time, and a relaxed phase that is characterized         by a light load and relatively relaxed constraints on response time.            Under this type of load, a bi-level algorithm is applied to reconfigure         the system after faults.  Specifically, at one level, called the fast           response level, a local distributed fault-tolerant algorithm is used            during strict phases to achieve fast fault recovery at the expense of           possible rapid degradation in the potential to tolerate future faults.          To minimize the effect of this degradation, a second level, called the          optimization level, uses a relatively slow reorganization algorithm             during relaxed phases to restore the system into a state that ensures           adequate fault tolerance in the remaining part of the system's mission.                                                                                         Computing arrays provide computational power that is comparable to that         of supercomputers.  Fault tolerance of these arrays is a very important         issue.  Traditional approaches focus on reconfiguring a faulty                  processor with a fixed local pool of spares.  This inflexibility                reduces the fault coverage capability and thus the reliability of the           entire system.  The approach studied in this research considers two             types of algorithms: local algorithms and global algorithms.  Local             algorithms reconfigure faulty processors using local information, while         global algorithms optimizes redundancy according to some fault                  tolerance criteria.  A combination of these two types of algorithms             allow a better tradeoff in fault tolerance of the overall system.",
