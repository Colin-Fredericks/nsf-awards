Funding is requested to purchase a CPU upgrade               for the computational facilities for biophysical chemistry.  The                projects for which the requested equipment will be used include:                Computer Simulations of Biopolymer Structure and Dynamics, Base                 Sequence Effects in Double Helical DNA, Molecular Orbital Studies               of Metalloorganic Complexes, Electronic Reaction Mechanisms in                  Metalloenzymes, Crystallographic Studies of Viruses, and NMR                    Studies of proteins.  The need for the CPU upgrade and graphics                 superworkstation is based on the computationally intensive nature               of these projects, and the need for visualization of the computed               results concerning complex molecular systems in real time.  The                 addition of this equipment will maintain the state-of-the-art                   computational facilities for biophysical chemistry at Rutgers                   which have been built up over the past several years.",
