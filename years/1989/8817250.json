 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is looking at the regulation of synthesis of LHCPII               at the level of translational control in Euglena.  Both genomic                 and cDNA clones of Euglena LHCPII are being sequenced to                        determine the identity of the proteins derived from a polyprotein               intermediate found during LHCPII synthesis.  LHCPII mRNA levels                 and the recruitment of LHCPII mRNA into polysomes are measured to               determine whether translational control operates at the level of                initiation of translation or afterwards.  Hybrid-release and -                  arrest studies are being used to determine the extent to which                  all four preLHCPIIs are derived through internal initiation of                  the polyprotein mRNA.  The results of these studies will aid in                 understanding the mechanisms of light regulation of LHCPII                      translation in Euglena.                                                                                                                                         This proposal looks at the light regulation of protein synthesis                of the photosynthetic protein LHCPII in the unicellular organism                Euglena.  This alga shows an unusual pattern of regulation of                   this protein such that synthesis of the mRNA is held constant and               the light-induced increase in LHCPII protein is associated with                 an increased level of translation of the mRNA to protein.  The                  research outlined in this proposal is looking at the mechanism by               which this translational control is achieved since the light                    regulation of LHCPII in other photosynthetic organisms operates                 at the level of mRNA production, not translation.  The results of               this research should provide new insights into the mechanisms of                translational control in higher organisms, both plant and animal.",
