 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed work is to develop techniques to support the           serial to parallel conversion of algorithms in such a way as to create          parallel algorithms that minimize completion time.  The techniques are          based on a graph decomposition scheme that efficiently exploits                 possibilities for parallelism in the sequential algorithms and                  identifies concurrent activities for scheduling on available                    processors.                                                                                                                                                     Communication costs between processors impact heavily on the execution          time of parallel programs.  Algorithm degradation can be severe due to          communication costs both in terms of resource utilization and waiting           delay.  A higher degree of concurrency necessarily requires a greater           communication cost.  The graph decomposition method for determining the         parallel equivalent algorithm attempts to find the balance between              these two conflicting criteria.  It is based on both processor                  execution costs and interprocessor communication costs and is designed          to yield fast execution.                                                                                                                                        As in previous approaches to this problem, a program is represented by          a DAG (directed acyclic graph) where nodes represent code segments and          edges represent data flow.  The concept that make the graph                     decomposition approach unique is that the data flow graph is                    partitioned into a hierarchy of subgraphs called clans.  Clan capture           necessary ordering operations and extract opportunities for concurrency         while reducing communication costs.  Using this structure, the optimal          size code segments that create a degree of concurrency which is optimal         when communication costs are considered is determined.",
