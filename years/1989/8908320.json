 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is growing evidence that Antarctic, and possible Subarctic,               marine.based ice sheets experienced rapid collapse as world sea                 level rose to its present position after 18,000 B.C.  Individual                events probably took place within 1,000 years and resulted in                   rapid rises in sea level of several meters.  These events would                 have caused shoreline translations of tens of kilometers on                     continental shelves of gentle gradient, such as that offshore                   Texas.  Existing marine geologic data from this region indicate                 that as many as four relative stillstands and associated barrier                trends existed on the northern Texas shelf during the late                      Wisconsin and Holocene; these features are separated by up to 30                kilometers and represent rapid \"jumps\" in the paleoshoreline.                   The proposed research will examine the distribution, character                  and age of sediments within buried incised valleys and their                    associated estuaries.   The objective is to develop a high                      frequency sequence stratigraphy for the region which depicts the                nature of recent (<10,000 BP) sea level events and the manner in                which these events have influenced the evolution of the North                   Texas coast and its estuaries.",
