 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to prepare and characterize                     surface layers by depositing ionic species from an                              electrospray source on various kinds of substrates.  These                      species are produced by electrostatically dispersing solutions                  of parent molecules as a fine spray or fog of charged droplets                  into a bath gas.  Evaporation of the droplets increases their                   surface charge density so that the resulting electric field                     ultimately becomes small enough to desorb ions into the ambient                 gas.  These ions can comprise almost any solute species in                      aggregation with cations or anions and can have molecular                       weights up to at least 40,000 with as many as 45 or more                        charges per ion.  They will be deposited on dielectric                          substrates (with an underlying conducting electrode) to produce                 surfaces that are either charged or neutralized (by a                           simultaneous or subsequent flux of ions of opposite sign.                       They will also be deposited on conducting substrates to                         produce coatings of electrically neutral species.  The physical                 and chemical properties of the resulting novel surfaces will be                 characterized.",
