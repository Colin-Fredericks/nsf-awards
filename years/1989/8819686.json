 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measures of stream flow traditionally have been based on averages          and the extreme levels during floods and periods of lowest flow.  For           many streams with widely variant levels of flow, these statistics may           be unrepresentative of the flows at most other times.  To correct for           this problem, hydrologists, geographers, and other scholars concerned           about stream flows have developed probabilistic models to describe the          entire range of flow levels for a streams.  This doctoral dissertation          research project will extend these types of models through development          of a flow-duration curve to represent the cumulative volume of                  discharge in a stream.  By refining this procedure, the distribution            of flows at any level will be estimated, and procedures for estimating          flow regimes at ungauged sites along streams will be developed.                 Following refinement, the models will be tested using data on daily             stream flows for rivers in British Columbia in western Canada.                       Development and demonstration of probabilistic stream flow models          that permit assessment of flow distributions at all levels will provide         several significant benefits.  From a scholarly standpoint, enhancement         of the models will permit more accurate representations of continual            stream flow, thereby providing a more complete empirical basis for              inquiries into patterns and processes of hydrologic variability.                Practical benefits from this project also will be realized, because the         refined models will provide more reliable estimates of the frequency of         flows at any level.  These estimates will aid in making decisions about         flood control, water management, and other public policy issues.",
