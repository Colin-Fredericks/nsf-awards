 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goals of this project are to understand the                  fundamental mechanisms and kinetics of amino acid racemization                  reactions through laboratory experiments using simple peptides,                 to apply amino acid racemization reactions to stratigraphic and                 geochronologic investigations of Quaternary and Neogene deposits,               and to improve age determinations through a better understanding                of racemization reaction rates and mechanisms.  To accomplish                   these goals, continued research will be done on the role of                     calcium carbonate in isoleucine epimerization reactions, in                     refining the parabolic kinetic model and in developing new                      approaches to obtain calibration ages for Quaternary fossils                    using isotopes.  Field projects in Bermuda and New Province                     Island will be completed.  Amino acid racemization dating of                    sediments and fossils has been a significant tool used by field                 stratigraphers and paleontologists.  Successful use of this                     technique depends on investigation of factors affecting chemical                changes in the sedimentary environment and within fossils to                    establish accurate chronology.  Therefore, the research is of                   major importance to geoscientists.",
