 "awd_abstract_narration": "An extensive body of research indicates that following                     central nervous system injury, there is often a naturally-                      occurring compensatory reorganization of surviving neural                       pathways. The behavioral consequences of such reorganization are                largely unknown, although some types of reorganization seem to                  contribute to functional recovery. In these cases, however, it is               not clear exactly how the reorganization contributes to the                     recovery that occurs.                                                                                                                                                Dr. Steward's research program, which has been supported by                the National Science Foundation for the past 13 years, has                      evaluated the functional consequences of the reorganization which               occurs in the hippocampus of the rat after damage to the                        entorhinal cortex, one of the principle inputs to that brain                    region. The currently proposed experiments will evaluate three                  hypotheses: (1) that fibers reinnervating the hippocampus                       contribute to behavioral recovery as a result of the information                they convey, (2) that behavioral recovery results from a return                 of excitatory driving and the consequent increase in activity of                the denervated cells, and (3) that behavioral recovery depends on               both the restoration of excitatory drive and on the information                 conveyed by the reinnervating fibers.                                                                                                                                This research will determine whether neural activity plays a               role in inducing synaptic reorganization. It represents an                      important step toward understanding how to manipulate the                       response of the nervous system to injury.",
