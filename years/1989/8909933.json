 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the plant family Boraginaceae, Heliotropium, plus                        Tournefortia and Heliotropium (section Orthostachys) exhibit                    great variation in many features of general biological interest,                including habitat preference, physiognomy, photosynthetic carbon                fixation system, breeding system and many morphological features.               Previous studies of morphology suggest that unexpected                          evolutionary changes may have occurred; in particular, C4                       photosynthesis may have been lost in one or two species and the                 \"Axillaria\" growth habit, in which the plant consists mostly of                 scorpioid cymes with bracts fulfilling the functions of leaves,                 may have evolved more than once within the group.  Additional                   data are needed to test these conjectures.                                                                                                                      Dr. Michael W. Frohlich, of Union College in Schenectady, New                   York, will conduct a molecular systematic study of selected                     species of Heliotropium (section Orthostachys) to test the                      conclusions he derived from morphological studies by examining                  chloroplast restriction fragment length polymorphisms.  This                    study could confirm the evolutionary changes that seem to have                  occurred in this genus.  The research will be performed                         primarily at Cornell University's Bailey Hortorium, over the                    course of 13 months of Mid-Career Fellowship in Environmental                   Biology tenure beginning in August 1989.",
