 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bodega Marine Laboratory (associated with the University of                California, Davis) is located on the north coast of California,                 and facilitates study of the marine shelf, rocky and sandy                      shallow-subtidal and intertidal zones, and diverse land-margin                  habitats.  The lab hosts resident and visiting researchers as                   well as graduate and undergraduate training.  Resident staff at                 the lab has recently expanded to include staff researchers and a                data manager for their environmental database.  A plan for                      expanding the lab's physical plant has been approved by the                     University of California system.  Research emphasis will expand                 in population biology, cellular and organismic biology, and                     aquaculture and fisheries.  Lab Director James Clegg proposes                   construction of a housing duplex for visiting faculty families to               increase the lab's use by investigators at other institutions.                       Research at the Bodega Marine Lab is diverse and of high                   quality.  Expanding the housing facilities at the Lab will                      attract more and better scholars and students to this unique                    setting.  The proposed construction will benefit research and                   education across the spectrum of marine biological disciplines.",
