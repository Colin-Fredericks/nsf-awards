 "awd_abstract_narration": "Utilization of mussel bottom leases to their full potential                     has been hindered by a lack of information concerning the                       carrying capacity of open culture systems.  Depletion of                        food particles in the benthic boundary layer above mussel                       beds has recently been identified as a major factor limiting                    mussel production in terms of seed/harvest yields, meat                         yields and mussel lease productivity (yields per area of                        bottom).  Model predictions and field data suggest that as                      much as 25% of the available food can be removed over a                         mussel patch length of just one meter at current speeds of                      5 cm/sec.  Phase I research established an experimental                         approach to obtain realistic values for the terms of a model                    which would predict optimal seeding density for a given                         lease site.  Techniques were also developed to analyze                          mussel food particle selectivity behavior, mussel feeding                       rates (consumption and assimilation), bulk current                              speed, bottom roughness, mussel density and bottom patch                        distribution, and food availability.                                                 The objectives of this research are:                                       1) To document, with a high level of confidence, that the                       carrying capacity model will result in an increase in meat                      yield at least 10% over present yields.                                         2) To develop a carrying capacity model which specifies                         optimal seeding density for each lease section, and considers                   the horizontal and vertical distribution of food particles in                   seawater in relation to flow and mussel consumption.                            3) To apply the carrying capacity model to the specific                         distribution of mussel seed from the seeding vessel, and                        to use the information about current speed and food                             availability to find promising new sites for mussel culture.                         Phase II will continue field experiments at different                      lease sites and incorporate these data into the carrying                        capacity model.  The results of this research should have                       direct application to the management of lease sites for                         optimal yields as well as develop a technique for finding                       suitable sites for mussel culture, and improving mussel                         seeding technology.",
