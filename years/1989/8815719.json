 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased research on marine fungi has shown that this group               is widespread and ecologically important.  Apparently, marine                   fungi have evolved along parallel lines from a diversity of                     ancestors, but their origins are unclear.  The recent discovery                 of Koralionastetaceae, a fungal family associated with corals and               sponges, may contribute to our understanding of the origin of                   marine fungi.  The most intriguing aspect is that the genus                     occurs not only in Caribbean but also in Australian coral reefs.                Because of the peculiarity of the habitat and the geographic                    barriers, no genetic exchange between these populations could                   have been possible in recent times.  It is, therefore,                          hypothesized that they have developed before the close of the                   Isthmus of Panama in the Pliocene, but most likely earlier.  The                primary objective of the proposed research is to clarify the life               histories of described and new members of Koralionastes and to                  prepare detailed descriptions and illustrations.  Examinations                  will include morphological studies and experiments with live                    material.  A second major objective is the preparation of a                     revised, illustrated and annotated key to the filamentous higher                marine fungi, to be used by taxonomists and non-taxonomists in                  the course of their work or in the classroom.  The last                         comprehensive key, published in 1979, is in urgent need of a                    revision because the number of described species has increased by               36% and many name changes have been made.",
