 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to provide funding to develop a fermentation                      system with the capability to monitor and/or control a number                   of fermentation parameters.  The first project is entitled, \"                   A Study of Bacillus subtilis metabolism.\"  B. subtilis is an                    important bacterium for hosting cloned foreign genes and for                    production of a number of extracellular proteins.  An                           important engineering issue is the development of cultivation                   techniques to achieve high cell density and efficient                           conversion of substrate to a product.  The PIs have begun                       examining the metabolism of B. subtilis under a wide range of                   growth conditions and a reliable fermentation monitoring                        system is required to expand their understanding of cell                        physiological responses to culture environment.  The second                     project is entitled \"Large Scale Bioreactor Growth Studies of                   Bone Marrow Stem Cells.\"  This project will focus on the                        development of procedures for growing stem cells and for                        studying their differentiation to various cell types.  The                      results of this research could have important utility in bone                   marrow transplantation.",
