 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant portion (70% and upwards, typically) of the cost of a             medium to large-scale computing system is in its software.  In turn,            two-thirds or so of the software cost goes into maintenance--fixing the         inevitable program bugs that are discovered later.  Capability-based            addressing has been suggested as a technique for detecting and avoiding         many run-time errors because of its usefulness in enforcing small               protection domains, data abstraction and secure module interfaces.              Several machines proposed or implemented in the past to support                 capability-based addressing have been plagued by their abysmally slow           speed.  The purpose of the research project is to design a high-speed           capability mechanism, examine and evaluate its implementation assuming          realistic technological constraints.  The project starts with the               formulation of a simple, yet powerful set of primitives for the                 capability mechanism, followed by the design and simulation of an               architecture using these mechanisms.  High-level benchmarks would then          be run on the simulator to evaluate the architecture.",
