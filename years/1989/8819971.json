 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major question addressed by Dr. Berman's studies is how the                 brain processes information given to it by the eyes.  As                        scientists have learned more about how vision occurs, it has                    become clear that there are separate systems for processing                     particular types of information, such as pattern, color and                     motion, which can be identified at all levels of the visual                     pathways including the retina.  In the retina, certain cells are                specialized to detect particular types of stimuli in the visual                 world.  These cells send information to particular regions of the               brain which are specialized in processing the same type of                      information.                                                                                                                                                    The two major types of retinal cells are the \"on-center\" cell,                  which detects light objects on a dark background, and the                       \"off-center\" cell, which detects dark objects on a light                        background.  In the retina, these cells are anatomically                        distinct, and each type is organized to allow it to \"see\" the                   complete visual environment independently of the other type.  The               major goal of Dr. Berman's work will be to learn how on-center                  and off-center information is processed in the region of the                    brain which receives this retinal information, the lateral                      geniculate nucleus.  Dr. Berman will use anatomical and                         physiological methods to study the detailed arrangement of these                cell types in this nucleus.  This will provide basic information                on how the brain processes information about contrast, an                       essential function for normal vision.",
