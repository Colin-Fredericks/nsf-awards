Areas of biology that will be emphasized are biochemistry,            cell biology, microbiology, immunology, genetics, and physiology. These         areas were identified as areas of great importance, through a needs             assessment. They are areas which have been developing rapidly in recent         years. After the four week course, follow-up seminars will occur during         the school year at Baylor and the community colleges to establish               continuing interactions and a formalized network between Baylor faculty         and the two-year college faculty.                                                 The university has requested overhead at a reduced rate.",
