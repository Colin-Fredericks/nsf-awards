 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in the                                 astronomy of comets by Walter Huebner of the Southwest                          Research Institute and P.D. Singh of the University of                          Sao Paulo in Brazil.  They will measure the continuum                           radio emission from comets in the millimeter and                                centimeter wavelength range.  These emissions may be                            explained as thermal radiation from aggregates of                               organic and refractory-silicate particles that radiate                          at a higher temperature than ice.  In addition, they                            will investigate photodissociation and photoionization                          rate coefficients of selected heavy organic molecules                           and their decay products.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The two scientists will develop a computer model for                            microwave thermal emission from these aggregates near                           the nucleus of several comets.  This collaboration                              will be an excellent blend of theoretical and                                   observational capabilities.  Therefore the cooperation                          will benefit the field of cometary science as well as                           encourage and strengthen both Brazilian and U.S.                                astronomy.",
