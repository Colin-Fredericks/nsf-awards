 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors Thomas Housley and Nicholas                      Carpita of Purdue University to collaborate in plant                            biochemistry research with Professor Philippe Matile and                        others of the University of Zurich.  These scientists share                     an interest in the synthesis and degradation of fructans and                    other carbohydrates and the physiological role of these storage                 polymers.  The focus of their collaboration is a study of                       the intracellular location of sucrose fructosyl transferase                     (SST) in leaf mesophyll cells of wheat and tuber cells of                       Jerusalem artichoke.  They hypothesize that SST is associated                   with the tonoplast, the delimiting membrane of the vacuole,                     and facilitates transport of sucrose into the vacuole.                          Further, SST can dissociate from the tonoplast and that                         dissociation alters SST activity.  They plan to test these                      hypotheses empirically after isolation of intact vacuoles.                      Dr. Matile offers expertise in the isolation of pure, intact                    vacuoles from higher plants.  He and his research group have                    demonstrated convincingly that fructans, SST, and other                         enzymes of fructan metabolism were solely in the vacuole.                       Drs. Housley and Carpita offer expertise in fructan metabolism                  and carbohydrate structure analysis.  They have demonstrated                    that there are two separate pools of sucrose in the cell, and                   that SST occupies a location in the cell where it can                           discriminate between these pools.                                                                                                                               Vacuoles provide a unique system to study in vitro the                          regulation of enzyme activity by membrane association.  The                     proposed collaboration will use vacuoles to test a model of                     fructan synthesis and thus contribute insights into the                         kinetics of sugar incorporation in fructans of protoplasts                      and vacuoles. Such information is important for understanding                   primary productivity in plants, and is essential if we are to                   consider modifying plants to improve primary productivity.",
