This project will help                   to guide educational efforts by preparing five review                           articles in three broad areas:  (1) goals and objectives of                     EVS education, (2) effective methods of EVS education, and                      (3) appropriate roles for public education and                                  non-governmental organizations, including private educational                   institutions and citizen action groups.  With guidance from                     an advisory board, the authors will develop articles                            surveying the results of existing research for ethics and                       values education and draw implications regarding needed                         research and the development of educational programs.  The                      authors will meet to coordinate their efforts, and the final                    drafts will provide the basis for a workshop at the sixth                       National Technological Literacy Conference in February 1991.                    Participants at the workshop will respond to these findings;                    and the papers and workshop outcomes will be published in a                     special issue of the Bulletin of Science, Technology and                        Society.  Further presentations and publications are also                       planned.                                                                                                                                                        This study is being coordinated by a very well-qualified                        investigator who has identified appropriate advisory board                      members and authors. Oversight and dissemination plans are                      exceptionally good; institutional support is good.  The                         projects important implications for future curriculum                           development.  Support is recommended.",
