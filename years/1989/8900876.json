 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for               Undergraduates Site at Vassar College.  The REU Site in field                   biology will support eight undergraduate students in summer                     research with six faculty mentors from the Department of Biology.               The summer research program will include 10 weeks of intensive                  field and laboratory research by the students as apprentices to                 their faculty sponsors.  Two weekly noontime seminars will                      provide opportunities for students and faculty to discuss their                 work with each other and on occasion with visiting scientists                   from nearby institutions.  In the fall semester following the                   summer program, all students will participate in a Mini-symposium               which  will include both oral and poster presentations of the                   students' summer work.  All student participants will receive                   reading assignments regarding their projects prior to the                       beginning of the 10 week summer term in order to familiarize them               with the work to be conducted.  Students will be selected from                  among applicants from Vassar College, Mt. St. Mary College,                     Spelman College and the Vassar-sponsored \"Exploring Transfer\"                   program, as well as from member institutions of the Mid-Atlantic                Consortium in the Pew Foundation-sponsored Undergraduate Science                Initiative.  At least three of the eight participants will be                   selected form institutions other than Vassar.  Special efforts                  will be made to enhance participation of minorities and women in                this program.",
