 "awd_abstract_narration": "A geometric group is a group acting properly                               discontinuously and cocompactly on a standard geometry.  This                   principal investigator is attempting to understand the                          combinatorics of geometric groups:  What are the implications                   of the geometry for the combinatorics?  What combinatorial                      properties characterize a geometric group?  The investigator                    has just established a combinatorial characterization of                        cocompact and finite-volume hyperbolic groups in dimension 3.                   He is also in the midst of the creation of computer programs to                 aid in studying the recursive computational structures                          associated with hyperbolic and Euclidean groups.  The next                      steps in the investigator's plan are the following:  (1) apply                  his characterization in as many different ways as possible                      (Does it imply that negatively curved groups in dimensions 3                    can be realized as conformal groups?  Can Thurston's                            hyperbolization theorem be deduced from the characterization?                   Can space-filling curves be so studied?); (2) use the computer                  programs to study interesting infinite classes of groups given                  by generators and relators (e.g., Coxeter's groups G(3,7,n) and                 Conway's Fibonacci groups).  The work of this project uses the                  subtle interplay between geometry and group theory to advance                   the state of each field.",
