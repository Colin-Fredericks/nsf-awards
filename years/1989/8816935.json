 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests continuing support for a research                   program aimed at achieving an understanding of the relationship                 between mineral crystal chemistry and metamorphic grade and                     assemblage.  Previously-supported work has demonstrated that the                ferric iron content and octahedral ordering in biotite vary as a                function of both metamorphic grade and co-existing minerals in a                given assemblage.  Proposed work will expand on these results in                two main directions:  by looking more closely at the other                      minerals which coexist with the previously-studied biotites, and                by examining other new suites of rocks over a range of different                oxidation conditions.  Samples will be studied using transmitted                and reflected light petrography of phase determination, electron                microprobe for major element analysis, Mossbauer spectroscopy for               iron redox and site occupancies, and fast neutron activation                    analysis of oxygen.  Our goals are to provide a more comprehen-                 sive data base for several common solution phases by modern                     approaches, to illustrate the effects of poor phase characteri-                 zation on petrologic models (and suggest possible improvements to               such models), and finally, to derive \"unique\" cation substitution               models for several of the solution phases we will study.",
