 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Drs. Brad A. Finney, and                 Robert Willis, Department of Environmental Resources Engineering,               Humboldt State University, to pursue with Professor Idris Maxdoni               Kamil, Institute of Technology, Bandung, Indonesia, and                         scientists/engineers at BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and                     Application of Technology), Jakarta, for a period of 24 months, a               program of cooperative research to develop a quasi-three                        dimensional ground water optimization model of the Jakarta                      groundwater basin.  The optimization model will be used to (1)                  identify pumping and recharge schedules to satisfy water targets                and control salinity intrusion and (2) determine the cost and                   environmental trade-offs associated with additional ground water                development in the basin.  The research will explore the use of                 quasilinearization, projected Lagrangian methods, and differential              dynamic programming methods for solution of the optimal control                 model.  The Indonesian scientists will be responsible for the                   development of a ground water data base for the basin and a ground              water monitoring program.  The U.S. scientists will develop a                   discrete time optimal control model of the Jakarta aquifer system.                                                                                              The principal water supply of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital and                  largest city, is ground water which provides more than 80% of the               daily water demand for the region's 6.5 million residents.  The                 overdevelopment of ground water in this region over the past                    decade has produced declining water levels and degraded the water               quality of shallow aquifers in the Jakarta coastal plain.  The                  research will develop new techniques and tools for the optimal                  management of the system and will be used to investigate the field              performance of a large scale ground water optimization model.  The              collaborators are highly respected scientists in the field of this              research.  The present project will allow them to combine their                 talents and interests for mutual benefit.  This project is                      relevant to the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries               Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                U.S. scientists and engineers and their counterparts in developing              countries through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of                 mutual benefit.",
