 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advantages of free-flow zone electrophoresis for processing                 labile macromolecules are well-known.  The technique is powerful,               gentle, and universally applicable to biomaterials ranging in                   size from low molecular weight antibiotics to whole cells.  To                  date, however, it has been impossible to achieve high resolution                and high throughput simultaneously.  In an early study, also                    supported by NSF, a prototype device was constructed to                         experimentally test a design capable of both high throughput and                excellent purifications; these experiments indicated the                        mathematical model of the process is adequate for scale-up of the               design.  The prototype model has a protein throughput equal to                  that of the best currently available commercial devices.  The                   present grant is for testing of a device scaled-up to a                         throughput two orders of magnitude greater, on the order of 100                 g/hr, and the demonstration of its separating power for realistic               industrial protein mixtures.",
