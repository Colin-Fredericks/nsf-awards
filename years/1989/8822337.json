 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal sets forth an approach for developing and testing a               causal model that will link health care resource utilization with               physicians' interpersonal styles and cognitive and emotional                    responses.  The topic is considered to be important for both                    theoretical and applied reasons: from a theoretician's                          perspective very few studies have successfully linked                           personality variables with revealed decision behavior, and from a               practitioner's perspective it would be very useful to understand                why some physicians use more, or use more expensive, health care                resources than do other physicians.  Earlier work by the                        principal investigator has demonstrated his ability to conduct                  this type of research, and the focus of this proposal on                        questions of generalizability, reliability, and empirical                       validation fits extremely well with the overall goals of the DRMS               program.",
