 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of impeller fluidized microemulsion liquid membranes            to the separation of contaminants such as heavy metals and organics             from wastewater is proposed.  The impeller-fluidizer developed by               Helipump Corporation is a self-pumping, durable, and inexpensive                fluidizer design which provides higher mass transfer and throughput             rates than typical fluidizers.  Liquid membranes have been employed             previously for the separation of metals (copper, uranium, cobalt,               nickel and zinc), organics (acetic acid, phenol), and, recently, amino          acids (phenylalanine) from aqueous solution.  We proposed to employ a           liquid membrane in an impeller fluidizer to purify wastewater of                prototypical contaminants (phenol, ammonia, copper and mercury).  In            addition, microemulsions will be used instead of coarse emulsions in            formulating the liquid membrane due to their inherent advantages.  The          successful application of the technique will result in reduced                  wastewater treatment costs, while increasing production capacity.                                                                                               This project combines two new technologies in the treatment of                  streams of process water.  The first of these technologies is that of           liquid membranes.  In the last decade is has been found that dissolved          metals and low molecular weight organic chemicals can be removed from           water by dispersing an emulsion into the water.  The emulsion itself            is made up of a solution of chemicals in water, which has been                  dispersed into an oil.  The oil is immiscible in water.  This emulsion          is stablized by surface active molecules called surfactants, which can          be selected to improve the separation.  When the emulsion is then               dispersed into the process water, the oil phase of the emulsion forms           a liquid membrane around the solution of chemicals inside the                   membrane.  The solution inside the liquid membrane is designed so that          as the ions or molecules which are to be removed from the process               water diffuse across the liquid membrane, they react with the                   components of the solution to form molecules which are insoluble in             the oil of the membrane.  This traps the molecules on the inside of             the liquid membrane.  By this manner a very high concentration of the           molecules being removed from the process water can be obtained inside           the droplets.  In this project a more stable type of emulsion with              smaller size droplets inside the liquid membrane will be used.  The             dispersion of the emulsion in the process water will be accomplished            by means of a new fluidizer commercialized by the Helipump                      Corporation.",
