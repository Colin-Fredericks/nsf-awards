 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in Biological Science has provided 160 high school,                    junior high and fifth and sixth grade science teachers in Los                   Angeles with lectures, discussions, laboratories, lesson                        planning and implementation guidance in forefront biology                       over the past three years.  Documented evidence is provided                     that indicates that many program lessons have been                              incorporated by the participating teachers in their                             classrooms and that components of the program have been                         locally disseminated by teacher in-service programs and                         workshops and nationally through conferences and five                           articles appearing in The Science Teacher and the American                      Biology Teacher.  Portions of the program have been included                    in the Curriculum Course Outlines for Biology AB and Life                       Science AB of the Los Angeles Unified School District that                      reach thousands of teachers and eventually millions of                          students.                                                                                                                                                       The proposed renewal is based upon formative evaluations over                   the past three years and consists of lecture discussions,                       lesson planning and laboratories in forefront areas of                          biology including recombinant DNA technology, cell biology,                     cancer biology, human ecology, developmental biology,                           evolutionary biology, human genetics, immunochemistry, plant                    biotechnology, other aspects of genetic engineering human                       physiology, marine biology and neurobiology.  The scientists                    who work with the teachers in the program include Nobel                         laureate Francis Crick and others who are leaders in their                      fields and are known for outstanding teaching.                                                                                                                  Completely new aspects of the renewal program include:  11                      new workshops, including one on cooperative learning of                         science and one on alternative frameworks in the teaching of                    science; recruitment of seven outstanding women, Black and                      Hispanic scientists to help serve as role models for the                        increasing numbers of minority teachers in the program; a                       four part new evaluation plan to document impact of the                         program on teachers and student learning; a documented plan                     for continuation of program efforts when NSF funding ceases;                    national dissemination of program products; and cost sharing                    programs estimated at about $276,265.",
