 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many stellar objects are known to possess magnetic fields.  In                  some stars, as in the case of the sun, the magnetic fields are                  relatively weak and chiefly concentrated in certain regions.  In                other stars, such as some of the white dwarfs or neutron stars,                 the magnetic fields may be very strong, exceeding the terrestrial               magnetic field by factors of a million and more.                                                                                                                The Principal Investigator proposes to investigate the magnetic                 fields found in cataclysmic binary star systems (which typically                contain a white dwarf) and in neutron stars.  In particular, he                 will study the emission of radiation, known as cyclotron                        emission, from the magnetic field regions of these stars.  The                  emission arises when fast moving charged particles enter the                    magnetic fields and experience rotational accelerations.  The PI                expects that the investigation of cyclotron emission from                       cataclysmic binaries will improve our understanding of mass                     exchange between the stellar members of these systems.  The                     investigation of cyclotron emission from neutron stars should                   provide information about the observed slowing down and spinning                up of the rotation of these objects.",
