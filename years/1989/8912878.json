Support will be given to U.S. and                           Chile an participants who will meet with Brazilian                              scientists supported by the World Wildlife Fund.  It                            will be held in conjunction with the XIII Federative                            International Congress of Anatomy in Rio.  The U.S.                             organizer is William Hamlett of the Medical College of                          Ohio at Toledo and his Chilean counterparts are four                            researchers from the University of Antofagasta and the                          University of Chile in Santiago.                                                                                                                                The workshop will focus on reproduction in South                                American vertebrates, rare or endangered, and on a                              potentially economic species, the shark.  All the                               major vertebrate groups will be discussed.  This is an                          opportunity for South America scientists active in                              vertebrate reproduction to meet with U.S. scientists                            and other participants at the Congress for an exchange                          of ideas and information.  There is also the potential                          for future cooperation in this area, an important goal                          of the Science in Developing Countries Program.",
