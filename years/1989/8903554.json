 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this study is to measure maternal oxygen                    transport which directly influences intrauterine growth at high                 altitude.  The study will test the hypothesis that fetal growth                 retardation at high altitude stems from a decrease in fetal                     oxygen supply caused by a reduction in uterine blood flow.                      Pregnant women living at 10,200 feet will participate in the                    study.  Measurement of maternal blood flow will be conducted                    through a noninvasive technique using an ultrasound instrument                  which measures mean blood flow velocity.  The instrument can be                 positioned to measure flow in the uterine artery which supplies                 blood to the fetus.                                                             %%%                                                                                  Studies at high altitude are of particular interest to                     anthropologists because they help us to understand mechanisms                   (both cultural and physiological) by which populations adapt to a               specific environmental stress, hypoxia.  Fetal growth retardation               is one of the most well-documented effects of high altitude.  The               mechanism by which this retardation takes place is not currently                known.  This study will address factors affecting blood flow to                 the fetus and their relationship to infant birth weight at high                 altitude.",
