 "awd_abstract_narration": "Properties of polymers depend not only on their molecular                  weight or composition, but also on the stereochemical arrangement               of substituents.  Stereoregular polymers are usually prepared by                heterogeneous polymerization and are limited to a few systems.                  We plan to synthesize and to study various properties of polymers               which will contain stereocenters in the main and in side chains,                We expect that in some systems polymers which will contain                      stereocenters in the main and in side chains.  We expect that in                some systems chirality of substituents may affect the                           microstructure and also may lead to control of the direction of                 polymer helical structure.  The latter case will be very                        important for polysilanes which have promising nonlinear optical                properties.  The first part of the larger proposal is focused,                  however, on cationic polymerization.                                                 Recently a few systems leading to well-defined polymers by                 cationic polymerization of alkenes have been reported.  They are                based either on the combination of the strongly nucleophilic                    anion with an activator such as Lewis acid, or on the addition of               relatively strong nucleophiles, such as aromatic amines or                      ethers.  In both these systems, the lifetime of the carbenium ion               is very short, and it remains in dynamic equilibrium with                       prevailing covalent active centers or onium ions.  Polymerization               is much slower than in the typical cationic system but the                      transfer and termination reactions are suppressed.                                   Cationic polymerization of alkenes leads usually to atactic                polymers.  The presence of chiral center in the closest                         surrounding of active site may induce asymmetric control in the                 propagation step.  Therefore, the proportion between meso and                   racemic diads should by dependent on the chirality of the                       counterion or nucleophilic additive.  We plan to prepare                        optically active 1-phenylethyl acetates, such as phenylpropionate               or chloropropionate, and use them as initiators in the                          polymerization of styrenes and vinyl ethers.  The NMR studies of                microstructure of resulting polystyrenes and poly(vinyl ethers)                 should give not only better understanding of mechanism of living                cationic polymerization, but also yield polymers with controlled                tacticity and potential industrial importance.",
