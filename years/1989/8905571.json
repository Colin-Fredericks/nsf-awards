 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Fine is examining issues relating to the general topics               of theories, explanation and interpretation--issues central to                  our understanding of how science develops--as they arise in the                 context of quantum theory.  The studies will examine how these                  topics are conceptualized in the quantum domain by examining the                different conceptions employed in treating a number of concrete                 philosophical and scientific problems there.  The object is to                  get a profile of the conceptions in the context of reflexive                    scientific practice, so as to further our understandings of the                 concepts and of that practice.  The background for the studies is               the movement toward a more piecemeal approach in the philosophy                 of science.  In particular, these studies should help assess the                orientation developed by Professor Fine (which he calls \"the                    natural ontological attitude\"); for that assessment requires a                  repertoire of detailed context-sensitive studies as a basis for                 reasoned judgments regarding the prospects and limitations of                   this approach to science.",
