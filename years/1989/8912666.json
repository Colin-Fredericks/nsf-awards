 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to measure (and subsequently                  explain) the dynamic response of the electrons and atoms at the                 surface of a simple metal to a time varying disturbance.                        Understanding the dynamical response of a surface is surely one                 of the most challenging fundamental problems in surface science,                since it requires a quantitative picture of excitation modes at a               surface.  On the other hand, the dynamic response of the surface                is intimately related to many physical and chemical properties of               the surface, such as energy transfer (lifetimes of excited states               and sticking coefficients), van der Waals forces, photoyield,                   both linear and nonlinear optical properties, as well as surface                plasmon dispersion.  Photoemission, inelastic electron scattering               and nonlinear optics will be used to measure both the linear and                nonlinear response of the elctrons at the surface.  Momentum                    resolved inelastic electron scatteirng will be utilized to                      determine the surface phonon dispersion.  The effect on the                     dynamical response due to reducing the dimensionality of the                    problem will be investigated by studying the evolution of the                   excitation spectra from a single absorbed alkali atom, to thin                  films, to thick films, as well as a function of cluster size                    using an alkali metal cluster source.  The investigation of                     dynamical response in alkali clusters is a new direction for this               research program.",
