 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Opportunities for Women award supports                       Professor Werner's work in Banach space theory. One part of her                 project concerns properties of Banach spaces that can be                        characterized by the existence of appropriate renormings, for                   instance the property of containing a subspace isomorphic to the                space of absolutely summable sequences. She will also investigate               the geometry of convex bodies in Euclidean space.                                    The theory of Banach spaces is about analysis in infinitely                many dimensions. For each finite dimension n, there is only one                 n-dimensional space, in most respects as well understood in                     general as in the familiar cases when n is 1, 2, or 3. These are                used to keep track of situations in which there are only finitely               many degrees of freedom. When the number of degrees of freedom                  becomes infinite, as would for instance be necessary to describe                the configuration of a piece of string, there are many possible                 reasonable choices for the ambient space in which to perform                    analysis. A key element of structure that distinguishes these                   spaces one from another is the way in which distance is measured.               Professor Werner's project is concerned with how the ability to                 rescale the distance measurement in certain ways impinges on the                geometrical structure of the space.",
