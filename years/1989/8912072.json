 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with economies in which there is asymmetric                  information.  It consists of three parts.  The first part                       develops a general framework for the study of markets when agents               have imperfect information.  A general equilibrium model is                     developed in which agents have private information.  A novel                    measure is used of the significance of the information held by                  economic agents.  The project establishes the conditions under                  which a large number of agents ameliorates the inefficiencies due               to the presence of asymmetric or private information.  It                       investigates the extent to which outcomes which are                             simultaneously nearly efficient and incentive compatible can be                 outcomes of markets.                                                                                                                                            The second part examines the problems of undertaking projects in                environments in which individuals' valuations are privately known               and individuals cannot be forced to participate.  The last                      section explores the effect of allowing communication prior to                  the play of a Bayesian game.  Most analyses of games with                       asymmetric information ignore this possibility.  Allowing                       communication can expand the set of equilibria and, if                          refinements of Bayes-Nash equilibria are used, can shrink the set               of predicted outcomes.                                                                                                                                          This project should be supported because the issues addressed are               important.  The research in the first part on general equilibrium               models of agents with private information could provide a                       unifying framework for the different theories of imperfect                      information.  The preliminary results from this line of research                find that even a small amount of private information can cause                  surprisingly large inefficiencies in economies with large                       numbers of economic agents.  The second part should provide                     useful insights into the many problems in which a group has to                  take a collective action and allocate individual costs or                       benefits of that actions.  The most pervasive example of such a                 problem is whether to undertake a public project and, if                        undertaken, how the costs of the project are to be distributed                  among the members of the group.  The third part extends Bayesian                game theory by allowing communication prior to the play of the                  game.  This is important because Bayesian game models are used in               nearly every part of economics to model problems in which agents                may have different information and the preliminary results by                   the investigator show that pre-play communication can have a very               significant effect on the outcome of the Bayesian game.",
