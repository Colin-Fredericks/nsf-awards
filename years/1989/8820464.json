 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Donald               Boyer, Arizona State University, and Dr. Gabriel Chabert d'Hieres,              Institut de Mecanique de Grenoble, France.  This research seeks to              investigate the nature of the flow of homogeneous and two-layer                 rotating flows along model coastlines (or sloping floors in the                 deep ocean), including the interaction of such flows with                       topography.  The modeling parameters for this system include the                Rossby, Ekman and Burger numbers, the slope of the shelf along the              coastline and geometric parameters characterizing the topography.               Primary consideration will be given to such cases in which the                  Burger number is small, so that the effects of stratification can               be neglected.  The research will include laboratory experiments and             analytical and numerical quasigeostrophic models.  The laboratory               investigations are to be conducted in the 13 meter diameter                     rotating tow tank of the Institut de Mecanique, Grenoble, France.               This facility permits experiments with shelf slopes approximately               one order of magnitude smaller than those on more conventional                  turntables (i.e. one to two meters in diameter) and thus allows one             to more closely simulate this parameter for possible oceanic                    applications.  The initial laboratory experiments  will concentrate             on understanding the background flow for the case of along-shore                currents in which no obstacle is present and for which the                      shoreline is either on the left or on the right.  The interaction               of these background flows with topography will then be addressed.               Particular attention will be focused on the conditions for which                such phenomena as blocking, eddy shedding and trapped Rossby waves              occur.                                                                                                                                                          The results of this research will contribute to the understanding               of basic features of topographic effects on oceanic currents along              sloping surfaces.  The Grenoble facility is unique and the                      experience gained in this project will be valuable for the further              development of a similiar facility in the U.S.",
