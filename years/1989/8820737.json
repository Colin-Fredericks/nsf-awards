 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the cricket auditory system, single nerve cells have been                    identified that are maximally sensitive to particular sound                     frequencies and to the direction of a sound source.  These                      neurons are believed to play a key role in acoustic                             communication.  Peripheral sensory cells send their information                 through functional contacts, called synapses, onto the fingerlike               dendrites that extend from the central cells to receive them.                   The structure of each dendrite, including its diameter, length,                 and location of synapses, affects the way in which sensory input                produces an output signal from the central neuron.                                                                                                              This project analyzes how synaptic contacts that are excitatory                 can interact with contacts that are inhibitory on these central                 neurons.  Excitation or inhibition is shown by physiologically                  recording the small voltage changes, called post-synaptic                       potentials, produced across the cell membrane of the identified                 neuron by inputs from known stimuli.  One key cell is labeled                   Int-1, and its selectivity to sound frequency and direction                     appears to depend crucially on post-synaptic inhibitory                         processes.  Synaptic inputs onto Int-1 dendrites will be                        characterized by physiological and anatomical localization of                   synapses, by determining how auditory peripheral neurons overlap                with Int-1 dendrites, and by using dual intracellular recordings                to identify neurons that make inhibitory synapses on Int-1.                     Functional and morphological correlations will establish whether                such inhibitory neurons have activity that is necessary and                     sufficient to provide a mechanism for the specific acoustic                     responses of Int-1.  Results will be extremely valuable for                     clarifying this excellent model system for analyzing hearing, and               should have impact on studies of communication, signal                          processing, insect biology, and neural mechanisms of integration                in general.",
