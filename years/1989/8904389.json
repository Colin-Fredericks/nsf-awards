 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between the geometry of a manifold and the                invariants of the elliptic differential operators on it is one of               the main unifying themes of contemporary mathematical research.                 (For instance, the natural frequencies of a vibrating membrane                  constitute the spectrum of a differential operator called the                   Laplacian; knowing the spectrum, one can infer a great deal about               the shape of the membrane.) The case of a region with                           fractal boundary, so irregular that its dimension is no longer                  an integer, has been the setting for some recent breakthroughs                  relating spectral information to geometry. In particular, thanks                to work of Professor Lapidus and a French colleague of his, it is               now known that one can recover the dimension of the boundary from               the spectrum of the Laplacian in such a region. This work, which                has involved both computer experimentation and sophisticated                    mathematical technique, has applications to the study of porous                 media and the scattering of waves from fractal surfaces. Its                    continuation is the main thrust of the project supported by this                award.                                                                               More precisely, Lapidus will investigate sharpened forms of                the asymptotic formula for the eigenvalue distribution of Laplace               operators with various boundary conditions. The goal is to make                 yet clearer the role of the Minkowski dimension of the boundary                 in this distribution. There are analogous formulas for the trace                of the associated heat semigroup. The case in which not only the                boundary of the domain, but the domain itself, is fractal will be               studied.",
