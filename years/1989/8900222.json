 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Haystack Observatory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,                carries out vigorous research programs in radio astronomy and                   atmospheric sciences, with its unique facilities in Westford, MA.               The Observatory is used by a large number of researchers and                    students, nationally, primarily in graduate education.  The                     emphasis here is on a summer research opportunities program for                 undergraduates as a continuation and expansion of the Principal                 Investigators' 1988 REU programs.  The PI requests funds for the                support of nine students during 1989 and 1990.  Research projects               in radio astronomy and atmospheric sciences will be supplemented                by a series of weekly seminars, facility tours, meetings on                     research discussions, and final report preparations and                         presentations.  The program is aimed at promoting in the students               an appreciation for the full scope of research functions in order               to develop excitement in astronomical research and to contribute                to student interest in careers in science, engineering and                      mathematics.  It is hoped that the recruitment and selection                    processes will encourage applications by women, minorities and                  handicapped students.",
