 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Manual of the flowering plants of Hawai'i by Warren L.                 Wagner, Derral R. Herbst, and S. H. Sohmer, along with 50                       collaborating specialists, will be a two volume work on all of                  the flowering plants in the Hawaiian Archipelago that are native                or introduced and growing outside of cultivation.  It will be                   copublished by the University of Hawaii Press and Bishop Museum                 Press.  The Manual is estimated to contain about 2,000 printed                  pages, including a full index and 245 full-page plates,                         illustrating over 1,000 species.  The Manual will include                       information pertinent to the identification, description, and                   distribution of about 1820 species of flowering plants.  It also                gives commentary on aspects of their biology such as                            hybridization, native names and uses, evolution, and problems for               further study.  The authors used current systematic methods to                  achieve an updated classification for Hawaiian plants and provide               means to identify the native and 1,000 alien plant species that                 currently grow wild in the islands.  The rarity of each native                  species was also evaluated by international definitions used by                 conservation biologists.  This new evaluation suggests that 38%                 (423) of the species are rare, endangered or already extinct.                   Thus, Hawai'i has more rare and endangered plants than any other                state in the U.S. except California.                                                 The first and only previous comprehensive reference work on                the flora of Hawai'i was published in 1888 by W. Hillebrand.                    Since that time, our knowledge of the flora has increased                       considerably with the publication of hundreds of scientific                     papers, and over 700 additional alien species have become                       established in the islands.  The Manual provides a synthesis of                 the published information, incorporates extensive unpublished                   field knowledge, and presents a modern and often original scheme                of classification for these plants.  This work will be an                       indispensable tool for present and future biological researchers,               conservationists, land-use planners, and amateur naturalists as                 well as for those involved in agriculture, ranching, and                        forestry.                                                                            This project provides partial publication support for the                  Manual.",
