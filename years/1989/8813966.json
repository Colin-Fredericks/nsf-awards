 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposed research is to study both                        theoretically and experimentally the wetting behavior of                        surfactant systems, with emphasis on microemulsions.  A new                     thermodynamic theory of wetting transitions will be developed in                which the effects of gravity, which are important in these                      systems, will be taken into account.  Conditions under which                    wetting transitions occur, as related to the structure of the                   surfactant, will also be undertaken in conjunction with this                    study.  Experimental methods to be used include novel titration                 calorimetry, dynamic contact angle analysis, and enhanced                       videomicroscopy.  A new theoretical model, based on molecular                   thermodynamics, will be developed, which relies only on readily                 measurable parameters, allowing a direct comparison of                          predictions and experimental results.  The proposed research is                 of both fundamental and practical significance.  It will be                     beneficial to our fundamental understanding of interfacial                      phenomena in surfactant systems as well as the numerous                         applications in which the properties of surfactant systems play                 an important role, such as enhanced oil recovery, detergency,                   liquid printing, microelectronics, magnetic recording media, and                novel separations processes.                                                                                                                                    It has recently been observed that, as one moves away from a                    critical point in a microemulsion system, a wetting transition                  can occur between the microemulsion phase and the excess phases.                This phenomenon occurs only for some surfactants.  The proposed                 work will investigate the role of surfactant structure in the                   wetting transition.  It will focus on the development of a                      theoretical model of microemulsion formation which will deal in a               novel manner with the role of the interphase region in the                      formation of microemulsions.  Specifically, the structure of the                interphase will be related to the interfacial tension between the               phases.  As the model will contain only measurable thermodynamic                parameters, the ability of the model to predict a wetting                       transition will rigorously test the model.  The proposed research               is of both fundamental and practical significance.  It will be                  beneficial to our fundamental understanding of interfacial                      phenomena in surfactant systems as well as to the numerous                      engineering applications in which the interfacial properties of                 surfactant systems play an important role, such as enhanced oil                 recovery, detergency, liquid printing, microelectronics, magnetic               recording media, and novel separations processes.",
