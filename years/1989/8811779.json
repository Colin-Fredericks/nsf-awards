 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work in deep-sea, soft-substratum communities                       suggests that species' abundances are strongly affected by                      processes at centimeter-to-millimeter scales and that many of                   these processes are governed by biologically produced structures                (e.g., animal tubes).  However, no mechanistic understanding of                 the role of such structures in deep-sea community dynamics has                  been obtained.  Dr. Thistle and collaborator Dr. Eckman are                     evaluating mechanisms by which the 2-cm-diameter sediment                       concretions built by polychaetes affect harpacticoid copepod                    abundances in the San Diego Trough.  In particular, their efforts               will be focused on testing responses to fluid- and particle-                    dynamic effects of sediment concretions.  They have used the                    submersible ALVIN to sample individual sediment concretions and                 bare areas of the sea floor and to initiate in situ experiments.                They will complete analysis of samples, which were obtained in                  previous cruises.  The analysis of these samples will enable the                determination the importance of hydrodynamic and predation-refuge               effects created by these structures.  The former, in particular,                are likely to be especially important in the deep ocean, because                of the relatively low rates of physical disruption of sediments                 there.  Further, sediment concretions are comparable in size to                 other widespread, deep-sea structures (e.g., ferromanganese                     nodules). generalizable.",
