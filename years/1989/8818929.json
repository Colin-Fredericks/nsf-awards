 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stretches of poly(adenylic acid) are added post-                                transcriptionally to most eucaryotic messenger RNAs.  This                      modification is thought to be involved in the regulation of                     stability and/or translation of mRNAs.  Poly(A) chains are                      subject to both shortening and lengthening in the cytoplasm,                    but little is known about the mechanisms for, and                               significance of, changes in poly(A) length on messenger RNAs.                   This research is directed at understanding the role of                          poly(A) and its complex metabolism in the function of                           messenger RNA.  The metabolism of the poly(A) tail on tubulin                   mRNAs can be altered by manipulating protein synthesis in the                   flagellated eucaryote, Chlamydomonas reinhardii.  Newly                         developed methods for nuclear transformation of Chlamydomonas                   permit an analysis of mRNA structural features which affect                     poly(A) metabolism.  The role of the 3' untranslated end                        (3'UT) of mRNA in conferring differential sensitivity to                        poly(A) loss is being investigated by the introduction of                       tubulin (and other) genes with altered 3'UT's into cells by                     transformation.  The hypothesis that poly(A) loss is                            influenced by ribosome distribution on an mRNA is being                         tested by introducing upstream stop codons into tublin genes.                   The protein composition of the poly(A)-ribonucleoprotein                        complex on tubulin mRNAs is being characterized by                              crosslinking poly(A) chains and their associated proteins                       with ultraviolet light.  It will be determined whether this                     structure is altered at times when poly(A) metabolism is                        altered.  The role of altered poly(A) metabolism in the                         stability and translation of tubulin, and other, mRNAs will                     be explored, using both in vivo (transformation) and in vitro                   methods.%%%                                                                                                                                                     This project investigates how the living cell regulates the                     levels of important structural and \"housekeeping\" proteins.                     Protein synthesis is a complex and highly regulated cell                        activity about which much research is centered.  Very little                    is known about how the cell controls the breakdown and repair                   of its essential proteins.  This research begins to fill that                   gap.***//",
