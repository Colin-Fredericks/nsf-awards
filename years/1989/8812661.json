 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethics and Values Studies in Science, Technology and Society                    supports research and educational activities to enhance                         understanding of the social values and obligations and                          responsibilities that arise in the interactions of science,                     technology and society.  This project will enable a                             neuroscientist to study with two humanities scholars in order to                address concerns that arise from new developments in his field.                 His career goal is to establish a research and teaching program                 in interdisciplinary studies of humanities and basic life science               at a major university or medical college.  This project focusses                on ethical concerns and value issues that are emerging from                     current brain research.  It includes a program of coursework and                independent, guided study in the humanities disciplines needed to               develop competence in ethics and values studies. Historical                     studies will examine the development of professional                            responsibility in the context of modern society and political                   obligation.  Philosophical and sociological study will examine                  how contemporary understandings of society and political                        obligation create a matrix for professional ethics, and study of                the mind-body problem will place current research in neural                     tissue transplants in the intellectual context of current                       inquiries about ethics and personhood.  The research component                  will identify moral values which function in the conduct of                     neuroscience and suggest the social responsibilities of                         neuroscientists.  The specific problem to be addressed is what                  contributions neuroscientists can make to discussion about                      human and social impacts from new developments in brain research                and technology.  The project will result in a monograph on                      ethical and value issues intrinsic to the conduct and application               of research in the neurosciences.                                                                                                                               This project addresses a very important issue and will enable a                 young scientist to develop his capacities to become a scholar and               teacher on ethical issues associated with developments in his                   research field.  He and his host specialists are uniquely well-                 qualified; institutional support is very good.  Collaborative                   efforts are likely to continue after the period of this award;                  results are likely to be appropriately disseminated and useful.                 An award in the amount of $38,000 is therefore recommended.",
