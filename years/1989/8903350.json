Recently achieved results have established a new type of                   relationship between the HJB equation and optimal control                       theory.  The value function is characterized in terms of its                    directional derivatives as the unique solution to HJB equation.                 The intuitively and geometrically clear-cut nature of the                       results promises powerful new first and second order optimality                 conditions as well as a deeper insight into the structure of                    the optimal policy.  An extension to stochastic problem would                   offer a novel unified approach to deterministic and stochastic                  control theory free of any kind of degeneracy or non-degeneracy                 assumptions.                                                                         The technical core of the research will be to establish                    the necessary relations between Lagrange multipliers and                        directional derivatives of the optimal value function as well                   as to identify and investigate an appropriate non-smooth second                 order differential operator.",
