For example, /t/ might have only the feture \u0131-syllabic!, while                  /v/ is specified as \u0131-syllabic,Labial,+continuant,+voiced!.  The                Principal Investigator's current research provides psycholinguis-               tic support for underspecification by examining phonological                    errors that occur in language production using an experimental                  technique to induce errors.  For specified-underspecified                       contrasts there are two biases:  segments underspecified for a                  feature tend to be replaced by segments specified for that                      feature, and there is a high proportion of exchange errors.                     Neither bias is true for specified-specified contrasts.                                                                                                              The forthcoming experiments will extend the research to                    liquids, glides, and vowels.  Together with the data already                    gathered, the work should produce a reasonably complete picture                 of underspecification in language production in English.  The                   results should bear on issues in phonological theory (whether all               segments are specified for the feature \u0131sonorant! and which vowel               is maximally underspecified in English), and on the nature of                   phonological access in language production.                                                                                                                          This work is significant in extending a much-needed bridge                 between research in phonetics, which deals with the physical                    realities of speech, and phonology, which deals with the abstract               underlying properties of the sound systems of language.  The                    Principal Investigator is one of a very few researchers who have                acquired the background and taken the initiative to undertake a                 serious research program at this disciplinary interface.  The                   results of the research should help lead toward a unified,                      comprehensive model of the human capacity for speech.",
