 "awd_abstract_narration": "Power system black-outs caused by a transient instability initiated by          some severe disburbance must be avoided.  The societal costs of such            black-outs are very high.  Present methods for assessing transient              instabilities are generally based on global off-line methodologies.  A          serious technological need exists for developing a methodology for              transient stability assessment (TSA), dealing with reduced parameter            and observation sets such that on-line implementation becomes                   feasible.  The value of such methodology rests in the subsequent                development of:                                                                                                                                                      (i)  new protection and control hardware for system components,                      and                                                                                                                                                        (ii) for the augmentation of stability boundaries by the active                      control of network elements installed for this purpose.                                                                                               The research is intended to impact on this need for an on-line TSA              methodology.                                                                                                                                                    Power systems which are presently limiting transmission levels due to           potential transient instabilities, could thereupon more fully utilize           installed transmission capacity towards thermal rather than transient           stability limits.  The need for additional transmission construction            on such systems may then be less critical because, in effect, more              useful capacity would be available with lines presently in service.",
