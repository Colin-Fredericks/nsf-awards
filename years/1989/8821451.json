 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to generate rigorous econometric                 evidence on the economic effect of alternative, compensation systems.           Particular emphasis is on examining various profit sharing systems,             studying the consequences of differing institutional arrangements for           levels and variability employment, analyzing rates of investment, and           examining the survival and productivity of firms.  This work will draw          on results from the previous award where a very detail longitudinal             data set of profit sharing firms was assembled.  The analysis of this           data has focused on exploring the relationship between levels of                unemployment and alternative compensation systems.                              $$$                                                                             Recently, considerable attention has been paid to alternative forms of          business organization and of workers' renumeration schemes.  In part,           this reflects the disappointing macroeconomic performance of most               industrial nations during the past decade, and a perception that many           American industries were losing their ability to compete with foreign           firms.  The failure of these economies to attain full employment with           stable prices has stimulated interest in alternative labor compensation         schemes that would link part of employee compensation to the                    performance of the firm, and thereby improve worker productivity and            the firm's competitiveness.  These compensation arrangements include            profit sharing, employee share ownership, and productivity gain                 sharing.  This project is important because it will provide a                   better understanding of how alternative worker compensation systems             might improve the performance of the US economy.",
