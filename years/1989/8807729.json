 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. G-Yull Rhee, Health                  Research, Inc., Center for Laboratories and Research, New York State            Department of Health, to pursue with Dr. Jeuson Maeng, Department of            Biology, Sogang University, for 24 months, a program of cooperative             research on nitrogen fixation by free-living blue-green algae                   (cyanobacteria) in flooded rice paddies.  The collaborators will                investigate (1) seasonal distribution and succession of nitrogen-fixing         blue-green algae, (2) seasonal changes in nitrogen-fixing activity,             and (3) the effect of light and phosphate on growth and nitrogen-fixing         characteristics of three unialgal isolates of the most prominent                nitrogen fixing blue-green algae in flooded rice paddies.                       The occurrence of nitrogen fixers in rice paddies is of ecological              as well as economic interest because they contribute a significant              amount of nitrogen to the nitrogen budget of the paddies.  The                  distribution and nitrogen-fixing activity of these organisms in the             flooded paddy ecosystem vary with climatic factors such as light and            temperature, pH, the chemistry of the soil and irrigating waters,               and agricultural practices such as tillage, fertilization, and the              application of pesticides.  Thus, their ecology and their economic              importance in rice fields may vary widely with geographic region,               from a temperate to tropical climate.  Few investigations of these              algae have been made in a climate such as that of Korea.  The                   information obtained in this study is important for (1) evaluating              the extent of nitrogen fixation by free-living blue-green algae and             the potential for utilizing them to improve the nitrogen fertility of           temperate-zone rice paddies and (2) the general understanding of the            algal competition and succession, and the impact of human interference          such as fertilizer and pesticide application on species interactions            in rice paddies.  This interference in rice paddies may be comparable           to the effects of eutrophication and chemical pollution in the                  aquatic environment.  This study also will provide the basis for a              comparative study of algal ecology in temperate and tropical zone               paddies.  The collaborators are highly respected scientists in the              field of this research who have collaborated successfully in the                past.  The present project will allow them to combine their talents             and interests for mutual benefit.  This project is relevant to the              objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks            to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists         and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,            skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of                 mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the project is supported by            the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
