 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial variability of geologic media, and consequently of                 media properties, is of key concern in ground-water transport                   studies, yet important information about geologic processes                     governing the creation of aquifer architecture has not been                     incorporated into hydrogeologic models.  In previous modelling                  approaches, spatially variable aquifer properties have been                     inferred from the statistical characteristics of a few measured                 data or an assumed spatial covariance model.  Typically there is                a neglect of interpretive geological information, even when it is               readily available.  It is unlikely that existing (spatial)                      statistical models capture many of the essential elements of                    actual aquifer systems and may in fact produce a geologically                   \"impossible\" subsurface architecture.  Therefore, we propose to                 replace the traditional stochastic simulation approach with a                   physically-based approach based upon synthesized geology which is               generated by a sedimentary process model.  We will explicitly                   consider the geologic processes which control aquifer evolution                 and which result in heterogeneity of aquifer properties.                             This approach combines sedimentary processes simulation,                   petrophysics, geostatistics, and groundwater modelling.  We plan                to use simulation to generate a three-dimensional synthetic                     aquifer (geometry and sedimentary geology), transform the                       geologic information at a very fine scale (i.e., centimeters)                   into aquifer hydraulic properties, and simulate three-                          dimensional groundwater transport using large scale numerical                   flow simulation and particle tracking.  We plan to compare the                  geologic-processes oriented approach with the traditional                       stochastic/statistical approach to groundwater flow simulation.                 Our approach will be tested on a complex field area (Santa Clara                Valley, CA) as well as applied to hypothetical aquifer systems                  representing a variety of sedimentary environments.",
