 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although real business cycle models show some promise in being                  able to explain macroeconomic fluctuations, the results from the                statistical testing and estimation of these models have been                    fairly disappointing.  Building on previous work on simulation                  estimators, the first part of this project will focus on                        estimating these models from a perspective which is more rigorous               than existing techniques.  With the use of simulation estimation,               it will be possible to shed light on questions about which                      aspects of the model might be inconsistent with real data,and                   which features of the data are important for which parameter                    estimates.  The second part of the proposal concerns the                        integration of a serious treatment of policy analysis into the                  real business cycle model.  The goal is to envelop a framework in               which various approaches to policy analysis can be analyzed and                 evaluated, and to derive conditions under which each approach                   might be valid.  Ultimately, the empirical implications of the                  model will be compared to U.S. post-war data.  One of the side                  benefits of this research will be a set of computer programs                    which implement the techniques developed in this project.",
