Dhondial the Director                  General of GSI.  The research will include field work in                        central India along a lineament belt, and will include                          geochemical and geochronological studies in laboratories at                     U.S. universities.  The objectives are:  determination of the                   tectonic evolution of the inta-plate lineament belt and the                     relationship to associated flood basalts; delineation of the                    evolutionary paths of the mafic and ultramafic dikes and dike                   swarms; determination of the chemical and isotopic nature of                    the parental magmas, study of the hot spot hypothesis for                       intra-plate magmatism; and development of a thermo-mechanical                   model for the evolution of the lineament belt.                                                                                                                  Scope:   The topic of this research was developed through a                     joint field workshop held in India which identified the                         specific lineament as suitable for providing the needed data.                   The work was started in the field and some laboratory                           investigations were carried out.  A program report was                          produced which showed interesting results and pointed to the                    importance of geochronologic and petrogenic studies of the                      areas visited.  The research project has the full backing of                    the Government of India, and enables a large number of U.S.                     scientists to work with their Indian colleagues on field                        investigations in India.  It allows the Indian scientists to                    visit the U.S. for participation in the laboratory testing of                   samples.  The collaboration is particularly useful to the two                   sides.",
