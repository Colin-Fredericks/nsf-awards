 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Organic Dynamics Program to Dr.                       Matthew Zimmt at Brown University. The goal of Dr. Zimmt's work                 is to advance the fundamental understanding of how electrons                    are transferred across space.  This process is of great                         significance to a number of chemical and biochemical reactions                  as well as organic microelectronics.                                                                                                                            The role of symmetry, orientation and bond connectivity in                      modulating rates of intramolecular transfer will be addressed.                  The primary systems to be studied comprise a novel set of                       donor-spacer-acceptor molecules which enforce an unambiguous                    geometric relationship between donor and acceptor.  The results                 of these studies are relevant for the design of molecular scale                 electronic components.  The dynamic consequence of                              conformational mobility in systems where transfer parameters                    are strongly modulated will be investigated. The systems to be                  investigated will include all three types of electron                           transfers: charge separation, charge recombination and charge                   shift. The effect of the structure of the surrounding medium on                 the rate and range of electron transfer reactions will also be                  investigated.",
