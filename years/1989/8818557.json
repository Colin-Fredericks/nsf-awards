 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in bioelectronics, imaging and signal processing                       procedures, and laboratory computing over the past several                      decades have rapidly increased our ability to record signals                    noninvasively from the brain and various peripheral physiological               systems with greater sensitivity and fidelity than ever before.                 Nevertheless, advances in physiological signal acquisition have                 not yet had a consistent impact on theory and research in the                   social and behavioral sciences for at least three reasons: (a)                  insufficient technical considerations, (b) elementary signal                    representation or analysis, and (c) fallacious reasoning based on               physiological data. To illustrate, previous research has revealed               that variations in emotion are followed by distinct but sometimes               visually imperceptible patterns of facial expression.  These                    important observations have led to inferences about the                         physiological mechanisms underlying emotion, and to                             psychophysiological assessments within the behavioral and social                sciences for the purpose of gauging the presence or extent of a                 particular psychological event or process (e.g., anxiety,                       emotion, group cohesion).  However, except in instances in which                the psychophysiological relationship is isomorphic or in which                  two (or more) theories make competing predictions about the                     physiological response, knowledge of the effects of variations in               psychological/behavioral variables on a physiological response                  does not provide sufficient information for a strong inference                  about the psychological variable given this physiological                       response.  To illustrate, research showing that a negative                      emotion leads to a particular pattern of visceral or facial                     electromyographic activity does not imply that this pattern of                  bodily response indexes (e.g., was preceded or accompanied by)                  this negative emotion.  This is because knowledge that a                        statement is true does not imply logically that the converse is                 true.  The current research will examine the social,                            psychological, and physiological processes involved in emotion                  using paradigms designed to avoid these problems.  This research,               therefore, should both establish a new paradigm or                              psychophysiological inquiry on important social and behavioral                  processes and yield more appropriate tests of existing theories                 of emotion.//",
