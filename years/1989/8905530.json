 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understand the mechanism involved          in force transduction occurring at the cell surface that is responsible         for whole cell locomotion.  The movement of flagellar membrane                  glycoproteins (in particular, a pair of 350 kDa concanavalin A-binding          glycoproteins) within the plane of the flagellar membrane are involved          in the whole cell gliding locomotion exhibited by the eukaryotic algal          cell Chlamydomonas.  Crosslinking of the flagellar membrane                     glycoproteins triggers a transmembrane signaling pathway that activates         intraflagellar machinery responsible for movement of the 350 kDa                glycoproteins within the plane of the flagellar membrane.  Experiments          are proposed to analyze the roles of calcium, cAMP, cGMP and protein            phosphorylation in the transmembrane signaling pathway in the flagellum.        It will be determined whether crosslinking of flagellar surface                 glycoproteins is necessary to activate the transmembrane signaling              pathway and whether the crosslinking results in a tighter association of        flagellar membrane glycoproteins with the underlying cytoskeleton               (axoneme).  Experiments are proposed to develop an in vitro model system        for reactivating flagellar surface motility and to exploit such a system        to understand the transmembrane signaling the generation of force for           glycoprotein movement.  Efforts will be made to identify and                    characterize the components of the motor responsible for flagellar              membrane glycoprotein dynamics and gliding motility.                                 Understanding the mechanisms by which cells control the                    distribution of plasma membrane proteins and by which they actively             change the distribution of these proteins will have significance for            understanding the functioning of higher organisms as well as                    unicellular algae.",
