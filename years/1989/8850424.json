 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the continuing development of a high school               science course that teaches physical science and mathematics                    using astronomy as its major focal point.  The material is                      designed for students who would not elect the traditional science               courses, physics and chemistry, during their last years in high                 school.  The long range goal of the project is to increase                      enrollment in high school science courses and improve the                       understanding of basic scientific principles by large numbers of                students.                                                                                                                                                       The curriculum concentrates on a limited number of fundamental                  concepts to avoid overwhelming students.  Mastery of these                      concepts is promoted by addressing the students' misconceived                   theories of nature and by emphasizing a wide range of unique                    hands-on classroom activities in both astronomical and                          terrestrial settings.                                                                                                                                           Two modules will be developed based on the \"Laws of Nature\" and                 the \"Nature of Light\" which will form the basis of a year-long                  astronomy course when combined with the previously developed                    module on \"Where We Are in Space and Time\".  Interactive computer               programs for building mathematical models and videos for                        illustrating activities and showing how scientists use the                      principles discussed in activities will be produced.  Teachers                  from a variety of schools across the country will produce and                   revise this material.  There will be both formative and summative               evaluation of the program using a number of trial sites.                                                                                                        The project has entered in a research and development agreement                 with Apple Computer.  To date, has donated $75,027 worth of                     equipment.  Both Bausch & Lomb and Celestron International have                 donated astronomical telescopes and accessories to teacher                      training workshops costing in excess of $23,000.                                                                                                                The project shows significant potential for becoming a widespread               program allowing for a useful course in which students may meet a               third-year science requirement.",
