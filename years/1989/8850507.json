Fifty-two participants, 24 in grades 7-8 and 28 in grades 9-                    12, will be selected.  The participants will work together                      with scientists on content, however, classroom applications                     will be done in separate sessions.  Twenty-six of these                         participants will be chosen as \"adjunct teachers\".  They will                   be selected by their educational experience in science,                         willingness to spend extra time with their peers,                               recommendation of school site administrators, and ability to                    productively communicate in a positive manner, the earth and                    space science concepts.                                                                                                                                         Project catalyst has the following main components:                                                                                                             Academic Years                                                                  The program during academic year 1988-89 will consist of four                   day-long general workshops held at CSUF and four additional                     workshops to be held at each of three regional centers.                         Three weekend field trips will be held for all participants.                                                                                                    Academic years 1989-90 and 1990-01 will provide a                               continuation of the summer institutes.  All Participants will                   attend two workshops at CSUF, two additional workshops at the                   regional centers, and each of the 26 adjunct teachers will                      conduct four half-day workshops for their peers.

Five weeks of classroom, laboratory, and Los                          Angeles Basin field instruction will be followed by a one                       week field trip to Yosemite and Owen's Valley.                                                                                                                  The 1990 summer institute will emphasize the space sciences                     with continued studies of atmospheric, hydrospheric, and                        geological science.  Five weeks of classroom, laboratory, and                   Los Angeles Basin field instruction will be followed by a one                   week field trip to local sites beyond the Los Angeles Basin.

This project offers the opportunity of studying the impact of                   an intensive earth science course on teaching practices of                      teachers grades 7-12.                                                                                                                                           California State University, Fullerton, the involved school                     districts and local industry have contributed an amount equal                   to 59% of the National Science Foundation award.",
