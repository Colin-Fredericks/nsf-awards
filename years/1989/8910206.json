 "awd_abstract_narration": "To date, the optimization of mammalian cell bioreactor performance has          been implemented via the application of empirical correlations relating         easily observable cellular kinetics to medium composition and bioreactor        operation.  While moderately successful, there is a limit to the success        that may be achieved with such an empirical approach.  A greater degree         of success maybe obtained by selectively altering the activity of the           metabolic pathways of the cells in a manner that increases bioreactor           performance.  However, it is difficult to alter pathway activities in a         rational fashion if the regulatory characteristics of these pathways are        not known, or, more importantly, if they can not even be accurately             measured. The development of a method to measure in vivo metabolic              activities, as presented in this proposal, addresses this limitation.           This method will provide a tool for mammalian cell technologists to             approach process optimization from a different and more knowledgeable           direction.",
