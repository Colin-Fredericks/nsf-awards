 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galvestion College will upgrade its freshman/sophomore physics                  laboratory.  The goal of this project is to provide students with a             work station composed of a microcomputer, universal interface,                  measurement sensors, printer, and appropriate computer software.  The           work station will be used to interface with current standard physics            equipment as well as newly devised apparatus.  Microcomputer                    instrumentation measuring techniques will provide for rapid and                 accurate data collection, enhanced data analysis, and allow for new             ways to perform physics experiments.  The microcomputer will relieve            students from time-consuming calculations and graphing so that more             indepth experiments can be performed.  Students will use the                    microcomputer to generate theoretical data and graphs to compare with           the experimental results.  This process will provide a clear display of         the physical principles involved and how they are expressed                     theoretically.  In addition, students exposed to the microcomputer              instrumentation will be better prepared to understand the uses of               microcomputers in advanced courses, research laboratories, and the work         place.                                                                                                                                                          The College will match the award with an equal amount.",
