 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will experiment with the use of citations among                 journals to describe disciplinary shifts among the sciences.                    Factor analysis will be used to measure the structure of science                at various heirarchical levels such as disciplines, subfields                   and specialties, as well as changes in the structure over time --               including changes in interdisciplinarity as well as the emergence               of new areas of science.                                                                A reliable methodology for tracking the changes in                      relationships among disciplines and the emergence of new areas of               research would be of great value to Science & Engineering                       Indicators and to its policy oriented audience. The objective of                this project is to explore the practical problems in applying the               proposed method and the usefulness of its results. The creation                 of methods for depicting the dynamic structure of science may                   improve our capacity to more accurately reflect real levels of                  national participation by field of science than do the current                  fixed journal sets.",
