 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide supplementary support to enable                         Dr. David Wing, presently a post-doc at the Max-Planck Institut                 fur Zuchtungsforschung, to conduct collaborative research for                   nine months with Dr. Akira Kato of the National Institute of                    Agrobiological Resources in Tsukuba, Japan.  They will                          investigate the response to heat shock at the cellular level in                 rice plants, with the ultimate goal of using genetic engineering                to increase the resistance of such plants to the stress of such                 shock.                                                                                                                                                          Heat shock response, which exists to protect all living                         organisms, is characterized by the generation of special heat                   shock proteins upon stimulus from special heat shock genes.  In                 this work, an attempt will be made to determine which cells in                  the rice plant are protected by these genes, and which are                      sensitive to heat stress.  A special \"reporter\" gene which can be               induced by heat stress will be introduced into the rice plants to               localize the heat stress genes.  Dr. Kato is an expert on the                   generation to transformed rice plants, and will help to produce                 the specially marked rice plants.  Dr. Wing has also previously                 performed extensive related work on the genetic expression of                   chalcone synthase in tabacco, in collaboration with Dr. Kato.",
