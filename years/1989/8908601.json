 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of a long-term study to determine the                      sequence and pattern of development of spinal neurons from the                  neuroblast stage to the adult.  The objective of the research is                to determine the relationship between a neuron's time of origin                 and its ultimate functional properties.  The specific aim is to                 determine the birth dates (time of final cell division) of                      various types of neurons in the upper lumbar spinal cord defined                by their 1) axon projection, and 2) neurotransmitter.  To                       accomplish this aim, two sets of experiments have been devised                  which combine tritiated thymidine autoradiography (for birth date               determination) on the same tissue sections with tract tracing and               immunohistochemical techniques.  The first experiment will employ               tract tracing techniques using Fluoro-Gold, Rhodamine                           microspheres and/or HRP in conjunction with tritiated thymidine                 autoradiography to determine the relationship between a neuron's                projection (i.e., ascending tract, long propriospinal , short                   propriospinal, etc.) and its time of origin.  The second                        experiment will employ tritiated thymidine autoradiography and                  immunohistochemistry to determine the relationship of a neuron's                time of origin with its neurotransmitter substance.  From the                   data produced, distribution maps of the spinal gray matter will                 be made which show the location, relative number, and                           distribution of neurons characterized according to their time of                origin, size, shape, axon projection, and neurotransmitter.  This               study is unique in that it is the first comprehensive examination               of neurogenesis in a single CNS center which will demonstrate the               proliferative period of specific types of neurons defined by                    functional parameters.  This research is clinically significant                 because it will provide a more complete understanding of the                    neuronal organization of an area directly involved in the                       transmission of sensory information including pain, and it is                   important because it will examine local neuronal interactions.                  Determining the chronological order of developing neurons is a                  first step in approaching the problem of how neurons interact                   during development.  The results of this research will be                       important when choosing appropriate embryonic stages for                        intraspinal transplants in spinal cord regeneration experiments                 and will be of value when studying the interruptive effects that                various teratogens have on the proliferation and maturation of                  specific types of neurons.",
