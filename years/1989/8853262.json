 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of New Hampshire believes that the advent of parallel            computing introduces an important new dimension to computer science and         that the study of parallel computers, algorithms, data structures, and          programming languages enhances and extends many topics learned else-            where in the curriculum.  Consequently, they are introducing a new              undergraduate computer science elective entitled \"Parallel Computers            and Algorithms.\"  The aim of the course is to introduce upper-division          computer science majors to fundamental theoretical results and give             them experience implementing parallel algorithms on an actual parallel          computer.  They are purchasing for hypercube workstations, to be used           for program development and debugging.  Designated time periods will be         made available on the department's 64-processor research hypercube,             enabling students to benchmark their parallel programs on a larger              machine.  Their department is in a particularly good position to                integrate parallel computing into the undergraduate curriculum.                 Students entering this course will have a background in computer                architecture, operating systems, and analysis of algorithms; the                curriculum is well developed, having grown out of graduate course               taught at this university for the past five years; and suitable                 textbooks are now available.",
