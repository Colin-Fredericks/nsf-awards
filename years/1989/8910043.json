 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Public Health Research Institute          for the purchase or upgrade of a variety of instruments needed for the          synthesis or analysis of proteins, and for a thermal cycler for                 synthesis of DNA using the polymerase chain reaction.  The equipment            will be used to help furnish a core facility that serves investigators          involved in studies of a wide variety of biological problems.  These            include the mechanism of DNA uptake during DNA transformation and of            site specific recombination, the role of protein-nucleic acid                   interactions in the virions of filamentous viruses, the mechanism of            proton translocation in yeast, the regulation of sporulation in                 bacteria, and a number of other problems.                                            The rapid advance of our understanding of a variety of biological          processes has been due in no small part to the development of                   sophisticated and highly sensitive instruments for the synthesis,               purification and analysis of proteins.  The equipment purchased through         this award will enable a group of solid investigators to pursue a               variety of projects concerned with protein structure and function.              Their rates of progress will be substantially augmented by the                  equipping of a core facility made possible through this award.",
