 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is believed that micro heat pipes are an effective way to cool               electronic chips.  Analytical and experimental techniques will be               used to determine the basic physics governing the fluid and                     thermal behavior of these devices.  Specifically, flow in                       microgrooves and thin-film interfacial effects must be analyzed.                In conjunction with what is already known about thin-film                       evaporation, this will allow a theoretical model of the micro                   heat pipe to be developed.  This model must, of course, be guided               by experimental observations.  By using wet etching techniques,                 triangular grooves can be etched directly into a silicon surface.               Electrostatically bonding a clear piece of Pyrex closes the                     device and forms a micro heat pipe.  Optical techniques, such as                ellipsometry allow detailed measurements of the film flow inside                the micro heat pipe.  Gross thermal measurements will be used to                determine the effectiveness of these devices.                                                                                                                   Currently, it is believed that micro heat pipes are an effective                means of transferring heat on the small scales necessary for                    electronic chip cooling.  If so, it can alleviate one of the                    largest impediments facing electronic chip miniaturization;                     namely dissipating the enormous heat fluxes associated with                     increasing chip densities.  If this study demonstrates this,                    micro heat pipes could revolutionize electronics cooling                        technology.",
