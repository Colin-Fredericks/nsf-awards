 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dekin and graduate student Peter Siegel will obtain                         dates on a series of archaeological materials from the site of                  Maisable which is located on the north coast of Puerto Rico.                    Through careful excavation, Mr. Siegel has exposed portions of an               early village and delineated both houses and associated mounds.                 He has also uncovered a number of human skeletons.  Based on                    associated artifacts and several radiocarbon dates, it appears                  that two consecutive occupations, possibly by different cultural                groups, took place at Maisable but the evidence is not                          conclusive.  Mr. Siegel will submit both bone samples and                       carbonized wood to the University of Arizona for radiocarbon                    dating.  A series of potsherds will be sent to the University of                Durham for thermolumenescent dating.  The results should allow                  more secure chronological placement of the different phases of                  occupation.                                                                                                                                                     Archaeologists have proposed several models for the population of               Caribbean islands such as Puerto Rico.  The \"wave theory\"                       postulates successive series of immigrants who move across the                  island chain.  Cultural changes observed in the archaeological                  record are attributed to the influx of new immigrants.  Other                   prehistorians envision greater population continuity and argue                  that much change occurs through in situ development with no                     population replacement.  Unfortunately, the data are not                        available to evaluate these contrasting hypotheses.  Careful                    dating of Maisable should contribute to an answer.                                                                                                              This research is important for several reasons.  Relatively                     little archaeological research has been conducted in Puerto Rico                and Maisable will help to rectify this situation.  Secondly, this               project should increase our understanding of how cultures change,               and how this change can be discerned in the archaeological                      record.  Finally, since the results will be used by Mr. Siegel in               his doctoral research, they will assist in the professional                     development of a promising young scientist.",
