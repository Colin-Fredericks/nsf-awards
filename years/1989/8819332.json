 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the late fall and winter, the winter flounder produces a                 family of unique antifreeze proteins (AFP) to prevent the lethal                formation of ice crystals in its blood.  Winter flounder possess                the ability to induce AFP mRNA synthesis in vitro by lowering the               ambient temperature of the fish from 18 degrees centigrade in the               summer months (when AFP synthesis is at a minimum) to 4 degrees                 centigrade.  More importantly, this cold induction of AFP mRNA                  synthesis has been investigated by the PI in vitro in isolated                  liver tissue and in nuclear preparations isolated from liver                    tissue.  In addition, the PI has sequenced a cDNA clone of an AFP               mRNA and with it, demonstrated a family of AFP genes in the                     winter flounder genome.  The cloned AFP genes have been                         transferred to a variety of fish cell lines.  Expression of AFP                 genes in transgenic cells has been established.  Future studies                 will be focused on generation of cyprinid loach transgenic fish                 with cloned AF gene by several transfection methods including                   electroporation.  Tissue-specific expression of the AF genes in                 offspring of transgenic fish following various acclimations will                be extensively studied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Basic studies such as these are of the greatest importance to our               facing global problems of biodiversity.  They investigate the                   survival of species under less then maximal conditions.//",
