 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Carl Lineberger is supported by a grant from The                      Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his                         research in the structure and dynamics of ions and ionic                        clusters.  Dr. Lineberger will use state-of-the-art molecular                   beam, laser spectroscopic, and mass spectroscopic methods to                    obtain information which is of fundamental importance in the                    understanding of molecular bonding.                                                                                                                             Tunable laser photodissociation in a coaxial beam machine will                  be employed as a probe of the vibrational spectra of ionic                      complexes and the rate of energy coupling between an ionic                      chromophore and the weak ion-cluster bond.  A supersonic                        expansion ion source connected to the coaxial beam machine will                 enable the production of moderate-sized cluster ions, whose                     infrared dissociation will be probed in high resolution.  Other                 experiments will expand our experimental knowledge of dipole                    bound states of negative ions by observing unstable molecules                   via their presumed dipole bound states.  Ultraviolet                            photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to study a number of                    organic diradicals, as well as to investigate the electronic                    structure of neutral metal clusters.  In addition, evaporative                  loss of monomers from cluster ions following photoabsorption                    will be used to obtain low resolution infrared absorption                       spectra of mass-selected cluster ions.",
