 "awd_abstract_narration": "His future research plans fall into three broad areas and are outlined          below.                                                                                                                                                          I.  Parallel Algorithms.  His principal objective here is to develop            efficient multiprocessor algorithms for the solution of large, sparse           Lyapunov and Riccati equations.  Such equations typically arise in the          control, stability analysis and model reduction of large flexible               structures for which high order, banded, sparse finite element models           are often available.  The development of efficient Lyapunov and                 Riccati solvers would facilitate obtaining low order approximations to          these complex models.  These simplified models would play a key role            in the context of simulation and feedback control of flexible                   structures.                                                                                                                                                     II.  Adaptive Robust Control.  Physical plant models are inherently             inaccurate and incorporate both parametric and dynamic modelling                uncertainty, often involving a large number of parameters.  In many             circumstances it may be possible to fragment the set of possible plant          models into smaller, more manageable \"operating points\" for which               locally robust LTI controllers may be readily designed using, for               instance, H  -optimal control methods.  The entire problems of                  controlling the plant then reduces to adaptively \"gain-scheduling\"              between these robust controllers.  In this connection he has provided           an adaptation scheme that uniformly input-output stabilizes the                 uncertain plant.  Much work, however, remains, especially in the                context of obtaining acceptable transient responses and disturbance             rejection.                                                                                                                                                      III.  Nonlinear Feedback.  The research here is motivated by                    fundamental questions such as:  What can and cannot be accomplished by          the use of (arbitrary) nonlinear feedback?  When are nonlinear                  controllers significantly better than linear ones?  Answers to these            questions are vitally important because they would allow control                system engineers to select or eliminate broad classes of design                 methodologies for specific design problems.  His principal research             goals are to develop quantitative techniques that offer guidelines on           actuator-sensor reconfiguration and the choice of an appropriate                feedback synthesis methodology.",
