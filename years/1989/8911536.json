 "awd_abstract_narration": "A simple, but natural, marine pelagic predator-prey system                      affording an ideal model for experimental investigation of the                  effect of fish predation on zooplankton behavior exists in                      Jackles Lagoon in the state of Washington.  This model predator-                prey system will be used to  test, by direct experimentation, the               hypothesis that diel vertical migration by zooplankton is a                     tactic for evading predators.  This will be done by manipulation                of populations of a planktonic copepod, Acartia hudsonica, and                  its natural predator, the planktivorous fish Gasterosteus                       aculeatus, in enclosures.  Experiments and supplemental field                   observations will establish the conditions under which migration                behavior is induced in the copepod population by fish predation,                and to identify the specific mechanisms of induction.  This is                  the first experimental test of the predation hypothesis and the                 results will have wide implications, not only for understanding                 diel vertical migration behavior of pelagic oarganisms in lakes                 and seas, but also for addressing more general aspects of                       predator-prey interactions, such as refuge use by prey, in                      aquatic pelagic ecology.                                                        %%%                                                                             Predator-prey interactions involving vertebrates in pelagic                     systems are poorly understood for many reasons including the                    difficulty in obtaining replicate samples, differential movements               of predators and prey in sheared circulation, and mismatches in                 the \"living volume\" occupied (scale mismatch).  If the predators                are confined to a volume that can be studied from the point of                  view of prey, the volume is generally so small that behavior of                 the predator is substantially altered.  A volume large enough to                be realistic for the predator cannot be sampled adequately for                  prey.  In Jackles Lagoon, however, the planktonic community is                  low in diversity, and alteration of behavior on the part of prey                has been noted in response to increasing and decreasing                         concentrations of predators.  For many years it has been                        suggested that diel vertical migration by crustacean prey in                    pelagic marine systems is a response to visually searching                      predators.  This study will quantitatively test that supposition.",
