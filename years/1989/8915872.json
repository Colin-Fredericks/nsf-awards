The goal of                  the research is the design and synthesis of man-made hosts for                  the recognition and binding of carbohydrates in aqueous media.                                                                                                  A glucose-6-phosphate binding host will be designed and                         synthesized. The design method will be based on a diamond                       lattice grid which allows for quick identification of possible                  sites for molecular binding interactions between host and guest.                The host will possess an enforced cavity with molecular                         recognition sites that are pre-organized and similar to those                   used by carbohydrate sequestering enzymes.",
