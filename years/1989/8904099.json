 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current evidence indicates that, during methanogenesis from                     acetate, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from Methanosarcina                      barkeri mediates cleavage of acetylCoA to methyl and carbonyl                   intermediates, then oxidizes the carbonyl moiety to provide                     electrons for the reduction of methylCoM to methane.                            However, isolated carbon monoxide dehydrogenase is known to                     catalyze only the methylviologen linked oxidation of carbon                     monoxide to carbon dioxide.  This research will establish the                   physiological substrates and products of carbon monoxide                        dehydrogenase, and directly test the proposed role of this                      enzyme in methanogenesis.  An assay has been developed to                       measure carbon dioxide evolution from acetate dependent upon                    the addition of a methyl accepting coenzyme, such as coenzyme                   M, to extracts in which methylreductase is inhibited.  Using                    this assay methylated intermediates of the pathway will be                      identified by their ability to replace CoM as well as by                        radiotracer studies.  The methyl intermediate proximal to the                   cleavage of acetyl-CoA will then be used to monitor                             purification of proteins capable of cleaving acetyl-CoA to                      that methyl intermediate and carbon dioxide.%%%                                                                                                                 Formation of methane and carbon dioxide from acetate is an                      essential reaction in the bio-degradation of organic matter                     in many anaerobic environments.  Acetate is a key                               intermediate in the breakdown of organic polymers generated                     both by the growth of organisms and by human industrial and                     agricultural activities.  Acetic acid is the direct precursor                   of the majority of biologically generated methane in a                          reaction mediated by microorganisms.  Some microorganisms can                   synthesize methane in a reaction requiring that the carbon-                     carbon bond be broken.  The enzyme which carries out this                       biologically important step is the subject of this                              investigation.***",
