 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Harappan civilization, which dates from approximately 2500 to               2000 B.C., is centered on the riverine region of the Indus Valley               and thus, encompasses portions of northwestern India and adjacent               Pakistan.  Harappan sites include large urban centers and this                  culture marks the appearance of true civilization in India.                     While the emergence of civilization has been widely studied in                  the Middle East and Egypt, relatively little is known about this                Eastern counterpart.  In this research, Dr. Richard Meadow will                 analyze faunal materials collected from the excavation of eight                 Harappan sites.  These remains of both hunted and domesticated                  animals will be identified to the species level.  Through dental                analysis Dr. Meadow will also determine ages of death.                          Examination of bone breakage and fragment distribution will allow               him to determine culling, butchering, and distribution patterns.                                                                                                With these data he will address a number of major questions.                    What was the nature of faunal exploitation practices at sites in                the Greater Indus Valley leading up to and during the period of                 the Harappan phenomenon?  Was animal exploitation in the                        immediate pre-Harappan period different from that in the Harappan               and did it change in the course of the Harappan period?  Were new               domestic animals introduced into the region?  Did animal                        exploitation practices differ significantly between contemporary                sites?  If they did, are the differences correlated with site                   size, structure, and function?  Are there patterned differences                 in the nature of faunal remains recovered from different sectors                of sites?  If so, can they be interpreted as relating to                        differential access to animal resources by different segments of                the population?                                                                                                                                                 This research is important because a study of the faunal                        procurement and distribution system provides a direct and                       important insight into how this early civilization functioned.                  Through this research Dr. Meadow will learn about the forces                    which gave rise to this early urban phenomena, which sustained it               and then led to its decline.  The results should be generalizable               to other such societies in many parts of the world.",
