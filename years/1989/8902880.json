 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project, called \"Academic Institutional                     Memory\" (AIM), are to: refine a set of tools that encourage                     researchers to increase their use of electronic information                     sources during research;incorporate machine learning mechanisms                 that are capable of transforming these researchers' browsing                    behaviors into self-organizing information structures; and                      analyze the information structures built manually by the                        researchers and automatically by the learning mechanism as                      \"artifacts\", created by the cultural process of science.  In                    addition to its contribution to machine learning and the                        philosophy of science, this kind of theoretical analysis is                     necessary to understand how new information retrieval tools can                 become part of the infra-structure coordinating the activities of               modern scientists. The work under this award will revolve around                three related themes: the development of a theory of science and                scientific activity as a cultural process; implementation of a                  prototype of the AIM system as a data collection technology that                will permit the testing of hypotheses from the theory; and                      development of computational models that capture the regularities               predicted by the theory.",
