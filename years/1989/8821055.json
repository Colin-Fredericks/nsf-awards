 "awd_abstract_narration": "For his doctoral dissertation research, Mr. James Enloe will                    analyze faunal materials recovered from the archaeological sites                of Pincevent and Verberie, both located in the Paris basin of                   northern France.  Both sites are attributable to the Upper                      Paleolithic Magdalenian culture and date to approximately 12,000                years ago.  Through meticulous excavation living floors have been               exposed at each to reveal well preserved hearths and associated                 lithic and faunal remains.  Reindeer, Rangifer tarandus, make up                more than 95 percent of the bones identified at each site.  Mr.                 Enloe will inspect the bones for a wide range of attributes,                    including age and sex indications, breakage, cutmarks and a                     number of osteological measurements.  These latter will serve as                a first step in the refitting of individual carcasses.  With                    these data, it will then be possible to determine whether the                   individual hearths were used contemporaneously (presumably by                   different families) and to reconstruct meat sharing patterns                    between them.  It will also be possible to reconstruct hunting                  and butchering patterns.                                                                                                                                        The study of recent and extant hunting and gathering societies                  has demonstrated that traditional groups employ a number of                     strategies to buffer against short term spatial and temporal                    variation in resource availability.  These include sharing                      between social units and development of storage facilities.                     Although archaeologists have argued about the antiquity of these                strategies and how they developed over time, no consensus exists.               Mr. Enloe's analysis of the data from Pincevent and Verberie                    should contribute to a resolution.                                                                                                                              In a preliminary study Mr. Enloe has developed a refitting                      technique which allows bones from the same animal to be thus                    identified.  It will be further refined in this current project.                Because this technique can potentially be employed in a wide                    range of situations it will be used by a number of                              archaeologists.  Thus the significance of Mr. Enloe's research                  extends beyond a single case study.",
