 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Ruan's project will exploit the simple but                       consequential fact that a matrix of operators on Hilbert space is               again an operator and so, in a canonical and natural way, has a                 norm. He and coauthors have recently characterized unital Banach                algebras of operators on Hilbert space in terms of these                        matricial norms. One of his objectives in the current project is                to obtain a conjugate-space analogue of this result. He will also               investigate cross-norms on tensor products of operator algebras                 from a matricial point of view, and will study a multivariable                  version of the Fourier algebra of a locally compact group.                           The mathematical research to be pursued here is aimed at                   fundamental questions in the theory of operator algebras.                       Operators may be thought of as enriched numbers, obeying the same               laws of arithmetic as ordinary numbers with two notable                         exceptions: multiplication of operators depends upon the order in               which the factors are taken, and not every non-zero operator has                an inverse. In the finite-dimensional situation, operators are                  just square matrices of numbers, the basic objects of linear                    algebra, and even at this stage the richer structure becomes                    apparent. Infinite-dimensionally, notions of size and distance,                 as measured by what is called the norm of an operator, become                   crucial. The essence of Professor Ruan's research is to discover,               by considering the behavior of norms, what sorts of mathematical                objects can be represented as operators.",
