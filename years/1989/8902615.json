 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study three projects in the                area of several complex variables.  The first concerns imbedding                strictly pseudoconvex CR manifolds in higher-dimensional spheres.               In the second project he will generalize certain theorems about                 the Kobayashi metric and related notions from convex domains and                CR manifolds.  The third project involves the study of functions                satisfying homogeneous complex Monge-Ampere equations which have                a prescribed singular behavior along a smooth manifold.                              How surfaces and their higher-dimensional analogues, called                manifolds, may lie in multi-dimensional space has been a subject                of great interest to mathematicians for many decades.  Certain                  surfaces, like the Klein bottle, cannot be placed in three-                     dimensional space without forcing self intersections.  But this                 surface can be placed into four-dimensional space without such                  intersections.  The principal investigator will study deep                      related questions for manifolds which are based, not on real                    multi-dimensional space, but on complex spaces.",
