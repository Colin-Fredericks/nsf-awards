 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and implement a library of                       symbolic manipulation programs in the SMP language to solve                     algebraic and computational problems arising in the calculus of                 variations.  All of these problems recently proven to be solvable               in an explicit computational way are, in fact, approachable only                through extremely tedious hand calculation.                                          The first such problem is determining whether a given                      system of differential equations can be derived from a                          variational principle. This problem comes in various forms,                     including the direct problem of whether the system as it stands                 is the Euler.Lagrange equations of some variational problem, or                 the more difficult question of finding an integrating factor                    which would make the system equivalent, in some sense, to some                  Euler.Lagrange equations.  Coupled with this question is the                    determination of the Lagrangian itself, possibly in some                        particularly nice form that depends only on the lower order                     derivatives.  Finally, the algorithms developed for computing                   dissipative decomposition of differential equations will be                     extended to deal with equations involving several independent                   variables.                                                                           The proposed library of manipulating programs would                        significantly speed up this line of research into the systems of                differential equations of mathematics and mathematical physics.",
