 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will allow a cultural                        anthropology graduate student to study the changing social status               of settled Bedouin families through evaluating the importance of                networks of gossip and women's personal networks.  The methods                  used will be participant observation and life history analysis.                 The specific hypothesis to be examined is that the settlement of                this previously nomadic society has limited the opportunities for               informal information exchange through gossip, and that this has                 affected the social stratification of the community by hardening                previously fluid social categories.                                                                                                                             This research is important because informal networks of                         information and gossip are important vehicles of social control                 and social interaction in small-scale, non-mechanized societies.                The insights generated from this study in this sort of society                  can be generalized to other face-to-face groups, and can help                   explain patterns of social stratification.",
