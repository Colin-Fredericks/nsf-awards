 "awd_abstract_narration": "A four-station undergraduate laboratory for digital hardware and                microprocessor design is being established.  Each laboratory                    station includes industry-standard digital test equipment and an                advanced computer workstation.  The workstations run schematic                  drawing, digital simulation, and printed circuit design software                as well as software for the attached microprocessor development                 system.  They are connected to common service equipment by a local              area network.  The stations are used to design, simulate,                       construct, and debug digital and microcomputer hardware.  The                   laboratory supports a three-course sequence starting with a theory              course addressing the general design process, digital hardware                  design, microcomputer applications, and hardware fabrication with               emphasis on hardware-software tradeoffs.  The first course would                be co-requisite for a accompanying design stations through                      structures experiments and ending with a small design project.                  These would be followed by a second design course consisting                    students which would be formally documented at each step in its                 development.  This course sequence, supported by industrial-                    quality laboratory equipment, would enhance student's theoretical               education while developing design and communication skills in a                 hands-on, project-oriented environment.",
