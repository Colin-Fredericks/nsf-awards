 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many respect, scientist understand the behavior of                      atmospheric gases much better than that of aerosols.                            Homogeneous gas-phase chemistry is inherently simpler than that                 which involves more than one phase.  Yet the heterogeneous                      chemistry of aerosols is central to understanding several of                    the important problems in atmospheric chemistry.  Some of man's                 activities may have an impact on climate because they create                    aerosols which alter the Earth's albedo.  These aerosols may                    also affect the tendency of water vapor to condense in clouds,                  altering their droplet size-distribution, spatial extent,                       tendency to precipitate, and optical properties.  Natural                       cloudiness may be controlled in part by the availability of                     aerosols in clean regions.  One of the factors which limits our                 understanding of aerosol chemistry is the difficulty of                         sampling them from airborne platforms.                                               Although many airborne experiments have measured aerosol                   species in the atmospheric, there are potential sampling                        problems with the inlets used to bring air samples into                         collection systems.  Inertial and electrophoretic processes in                  sampling inlets have the potential to remove some aerosols                      upstream of a filter, for instance.  Losses can exceed 50% in                   some cases.  In the Particulate matter Airborne Sampling INlet                  experiment aerosols will be sampled simultaneously with a                       variety of intake systems aboard NCAR's Electra, to determine                   which parameters (flow Reynolds number, Stokes number, redius                   of curvature, surface coating, aerosol diameter, etc.) control                  these losses.  The ultimate goal is the development of the most                 artifact-free sampling system possible for collecting aerosols                  from aircraft.",
