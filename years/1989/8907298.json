 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is a continuation and expansion of long-term                    studies of population dynamics and habitat selection by two                     migratory passerine bird species on their breeding grounds, in                  forested parts of central New Hampshire and on wintering sites in               Jamaica.  It combines experimental, observational, and                          demographic approaches to test the hypothesis that populations of               these species are limited both in summer and winter.  Three steps               will be used in both areas:  (1) a test whether habitat selection               is density dependent and/or despotic (i.e., younger individuals                 or females are constrained by socially dominant older males), as                reflected in distribution patterns along habitat gradients, and                 by testing for dominance behavior directly; (2) a test for                      consequences of dominance behavior on age- and sex-specific                     reproduction and/or survival by habitat, and (3) a determination                of the importance of temporally and spatially variable food                     supplies (especially a defoliating caterpillar in breeding                      areas) and predators as possible ecological causes of demographic               patterns observed.  Finally, the relative importance of                         temporally variable ecological conditions on age-structure and                  abundances of these populations will be assessed.  Such                         information is urgently needed by conservationists, due to rapid                habitat loss for these migratory species on both breeding and                   wintering areas.",
