 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a research workshop on algebraic K-theory,              jointly organized by Professor Keith Dennis of Cornell University               and Professor Claudio Pedrini of the University of Genova, Italy.               The subject matter of the proposed workshop is algebraic K-theory               and connections with and impact upon commutative algebra and                    algebraic geometry.  More specifically, the workshop will focus on              three areas:  extending the ideas of the Riemann-Roch theorems to               varieties with isolated singularities, using in the process                     connections with commutative algebra, O-cycles, and geometry;                   applications of K-theory to the study of arithmetic surfaces; and               the study of various cohomology complexes useful in the interplay               between K-theory and algebraic geometry.                                                                                                                        The proposed workshop is timely and affords an opportunity for                  leading contributors from both countries in the field to get                    together and exchange information on complementary approaches to                the problems to be discussed.  Consequently, it should help to                  advance and unify progress in an important subfield of mathematics.",
