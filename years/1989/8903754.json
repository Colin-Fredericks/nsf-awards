 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is being conducted on the structure and function of                    photosynthetic reaction centers in the green sulfur bacteria.                   The specific objective is to study the donors and acceptors                     active in the electron transfer reactions that lead to charge                   stabilization in the primary quantum conversion process. Their                  identity and kinetic interactions are being analyzed by fast                    transient absorption spectroscopy and ESR.  The work is                         facilitated by the use of bacteria grown in conditions that                     inhibit the synthesis of antenna pigment.  Stable, purified                     reaction centers will be used to study the polypeptides and                     localization of the acceptors on the various sub-units.  The                    possible involvement of a quinone as acceptor will be examined by               organic solvent extraction and reconstitution.                                                                                                                  The primary reactions of light conversion to chemical energy                    during photosynthesis take place in pigment-protein complexes                   called reaction centers.  The reaction centers of some bacteria                 have been thoroughly studied.  The green bacteria occupy a key                  position for comparative and evolutionary study but their                       reaction centers have not been studied.  This project focuses on                the green bacteria reaction center because it appears to be very                similar but a simplified version of the light capturing system of               higher plants.",
