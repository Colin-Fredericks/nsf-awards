 "awd_abstract_narration": "While some progress has been made in understanding the relationships            between earnings dynamics and the job mobility of workers, a complete           analysis has been hampered by the lack of a framework to distinguish            the relative importance of various theories of mobility.  The purpose           of this research is to develop and carry out an extensive set of tests          of competing theories of mobility using information primarily on (1)            the pattern of prior mobility, (2) wage and mobility histories                  following involuntary job changes, (3) mobility during the first year           on the job, and (4) the relationship between the method of job search           and mobility.  Longitudinal data from a varied of sources, starting             with the NLS youth cohort, will be used to implement the model.  In             addition, to distinguishing the various theories, important facts will          be learned about labor market dynamics and specific patterns of                 mobility.  This project is important because it will increase our               understanding of job mobility which will begin to help us explain the           patterns of wage growth within and between jobs.",
