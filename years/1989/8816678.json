 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chaetetes, a fossil demosponge, is the common reef-building                     organism of the Carboniferous.  As such, Chaetetes commonly                     occurs as laminar, domical, or columnar colonies.  As is true of                a number of clonal reef-builders, the growth form has been                      considered a reflection of the depositional environment with                    columnar colonies indicating greater turbulence.  Such is not                   unreasonable, but it is possible that the different growth forms                are different species.  Variations in the microstructural details               of chaetetid colonies has been used to distinguish species of                   Carboniferous Chaetetes.  Unfortunately, these features are                     subject to diagenetic alteration and the degree of variability                  within these features is great.  Characteristics of nearly all                  the \"species\" of Carboniferous Chaetetes can be found on a                      polished surface of a single specimen.  Proposed research will:                 1) test the validity of the criteria used to distinguish species                of Carboniferous Chaetetes of North America; 2) look for criteria               that might be less affected by preservation and more indicative                 of genetic variability, such as the way new calicles are added to               the colony; and 3) determine the degree to which the growth form                of chaetetid species is environmentally controlled.  By                         clarifying the taxonomy of chaetetids it will be possible to                    address: 1) anomalies in the spatial and temporal distribution of               this group, 2) some aspects of Carboniferous extinction events,                 and 3) the role of chaetetids in the structure and development of               Carboniferous reefs.",
