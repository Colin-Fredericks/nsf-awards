 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a way of managing the growing complexity of engineering                 designs, the design automation community is moving towards the                  use of hierarchical design tools: tools that operate on multi-                  layer representations of the complex structures being designed,                 so that lower, more detailed aspects of a design are not                        visible until the user specifically requests to see those                       aspects.  This research will investigate the impact of a                        hierarchical, highly interactive design environment on the                      performance requirements for a database management system                       storing design information.  Work completed by others shows                     that extended relational databases can exhibit satisfactory                     data retrieval performance in a design environment with (1)                     heavy use of main-memory caching, (2) a non-relational                          implementation, and (3) hierarchical design tools.                                   The goal of this research is to develop a finer-grained                    examination of the data retrieval and update performance                        requirements of hierarchical design tools, and to test whether                  satisfactory update performance can be obtained using an                        extended relational database.  To this end, the principal                       investigator will instrument Magic, a hierarchical VLSI layout                  editor; collect protocols of Magic's use by expert designers;                   and analyze these protocols against appropriate models of                       database access costs.                                                              This project will include support for one undergraduate                     student.",
