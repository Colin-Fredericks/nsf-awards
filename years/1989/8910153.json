 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synthesis of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase                      (MnSOD) in Escherichia coli is regulated by changes in the redox                state of the cell as well as by the concentrations of oxygen,                   superoxide radicals, and intracellular iron.  To accommodate                    these facts, a regulatory model based on a negatively-controlled                operon has been proposed where an iron-containing redox-sensitive               protein is envisioned to play the role of a repressor.  The best                proof of this model comes from recent success in isolating trans-               acting mutations that cause the constitutive expression of sodA                 gene.  This is the first time such mutants have been isolated.                  The MnSOD regulatory gene (sodR), will be cloned, its nucleotide                sequence determined, and its position mapped on the E. coli                     chromosome.  The product(s) of sodR gene will be identified and                 purified and its effect on the expression of sodA will be                       studied.  Studies to identify the operator site of sodA gene will               be conducted.                                                                                                                                                   Oxygen is essential for the survival of aerobic organisms, yet it               is known to be toxic and mutagenic.  These deleterious  effects                 of oxygen are due to the generation of several reactive partially               reduced intermediates.  Superoxide dismutases are present in                    almost all living cells and provide protection against oxygen                   toxicity and mutagenicity by scavenging and eliminating the                     deleterious chemical species.  Understanding the mechanisms of                  regulation of superoxide dismutases is essential in order to                    understand how aerobic as well as anaerobic cells cope with                     oxygen and oxidative stresses.",
