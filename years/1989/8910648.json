 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the research program of the experimental               nuclear physics laboratory at Florida State University.  The                    laboratory includes a superconducting linear accelerator and an                 FN tandem Van de Graaff accelerator injector.  The research of                  the laboratory lies in six main areas.  The macroscopic                         properties of nuclear reactions with heavy ions are studied                     through inclusive and coincidence measurements of fusion,                       fission, breakup, and incomplete fusion reactions.  High                        resolution resonant particle decay spectroscopy is applied to                   studies of selected high spin, high excitation energy states.                   The interaction of collective and single.particle excitations is                examined in f.p.g shell nuclei using gamma.gamma and                            multiparticle.gamma coincidence techniques.  Spin dependent                     effects in reactions, including asearch for a spin orbit force,                 will be carried out using reactions induced by beams of polarized               lithium.6 and lithium.7.  The effects of angular momentum on                    octupole excitations will be pursued experimentally using a                     variety of techniques.                                                               Collaborative research at CEBAF, Argonne and                               other laboratories is also conducted, as is collaborative                       research with outside users of the Florida State                                University accelerators.  In addition, ongoing projects to                      construct an optically pumped polarized ion source, and a large                 solid.angle Bragg curve spectrometer will be completed.",
