 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Arveson and Voiculescu will investigate several                 areas of noncommutative analysis involving von Neumann algebras,                quantized index theory, C* - algebras, Fredholm modules, and                    noncommutative random variables. Arveson's part of the project                  involves the index theory and classification theory of semigroups               of endomorphisms of factors, and the structure of the C* -                      algebras associated to such semigroups. Voiculescu will continue                his research on quasicentral approximate units relative to normed               ideals and their relationship to Fredholm modules, and on the                   noncommutative probability theory of free products. He will look                further into the relation between nuclear C* - algebras and the                 approximation theory of operators.                                                   This mathematical research project is concerned with various               constructions and techniques involving operators on Hilbert                     space. Operators may be thought of as a species of enriched                     numbers. They obey the same rules of arithmetic as numbers except               that the result of multiplication depends upon the order in which               the factors are taken, and not every nonzero operator has an                    inverse. It has proven to be a very fruitful exercise, both in                  theoretical physics and in pure mathematics, to see what happens                when numbers are replaced by operators in a given context.                      Professor Arveson, for instance, is studying systems that arise                 when time-dependent numbers are replaced by time-dependent                      operators. One of Professor Voiculescu's ongoing investigations                 involves a noncommutative version of probability theory in which                random variables are treated as if they were operator-valued                    rather than number-valued.",
