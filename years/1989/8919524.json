 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transgenic production animals which express therapeutic                         proteins in their milk offer a potential significant source                     which could augment plasma-derived proteins.  The (tissue                       culture) production of these same proteins using                                genetically engineered mammalian cells is currently limited                     in its ability to perform post-translational modifications.                     These modifications may be essential for proper                                 functionally and non-immunogenicity.  For example,                              uniformly modified production of Protein C (a central                           regulator of hemostasis) using mammalian cell culture is                        being achieved at levels which will probably not supply the                     currently projected l00 Kg per annum need for Protein C.                        It has been established that transgenic animals can be made                     to produce human proteins in their milk and therefore used                      as bioreactors for that same purpose.  Several exciting                         developments in this area have occurred over the past year                      for both rodent and large production animal species.  This                      symposium and workshop is the second of a series of two-                        proposed meetings to gather together important contributors                     (biologists, biochemical engineers, etc.) in transgenic                         science and milk processing.  The central and unique goal                       of this two-part transgenic animal workshop is to assess                        the impact that this rapidly growing area of biology will                       have upon biochemical engineering and the production of                         protein therapeutics.",
