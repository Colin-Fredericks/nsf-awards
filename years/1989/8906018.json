The proposed system consists of a portable microwave network          analyzer configured as a short-range radar system, and a dynamic                signal analyzer for baseband signal processing and analysis.  The               temporal and/or spatial decorrelation data will be gathered at various          frequencies, polarizations, incidence angles, and antenna beamwidths,           under varied ground-truth conditions.  Simple models will also be               developed in order to predict the decorrelation time/distance based on          measured ground-truth parameters, and compared to measured data.  The           research is expected to have an impact on target identification and             terrain classification for both military and commercial applications.",
