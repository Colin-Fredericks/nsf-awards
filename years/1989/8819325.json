 "awd_abstract_narration": "The knotted mutation in maize disrupts normal leaf                              development by altering the timing of differentiation and                       growth pattern of certain leaf cells.  The phenotype ranges                     from a clearing of the photosynthetic cells that normally                       surround the lateral veins, to sporadic knots along the                         lateral veins which grow out of the plane of the leaf.                          Lastly, the ligule is displaced and found parallel to the                       veins  in the leaf blade.  There are four Kn1 mutations that                    differ in their severity and timing although they all map to                    the same location on the long arm of chromosome 1.  We have                     cloned one of the mutations using Ds2 as a transposon tag.                      This particular mutation requires a trans-acting Ac for                         expression and the phenotype increases in severity with an                      increase in Ac dosage.  The Ds2 mutation, Kn1-2F11, has                         enabled us to begin a molecular analysis of another Kn1                         mutation, Kn1-0.  Kn1-0 appears to be a duplication, the                        breakpoint of which falls within 1 kb of the site of the Ds2                    insertion in Kn1-2F11.  DNA 5 kb distal to the region altered                   in these two mutants is highly conserved.  We will isolate                      and analyze cDNA and genomic clones of the different knotted                    mutations and their wildtype alleles.  In situ hybridization                    techniques will be used to determine when and in what tissues                   the Kn1 and wildtype genes are expressed.  The nature of the                    Ds-Ac interaction in the Kn1-2F11 mutation will be                              determined.  Our long range goal is to determine how the                        development of the leaf involves Kn1 or \"kn\" expression.                                                                                                        The use of recombinant technology has made it possible to                       study plant development at a molecular genetic level.                           However, as yet, only a few laboratories have started doing                     so.  Corn, because it has been genetically studied                              extensively, is an excellent experimental organism.  The                        results of this study should provide greater insight into how                   plants form leaves.",
