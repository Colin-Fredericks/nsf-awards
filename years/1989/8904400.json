 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is evidence for two basic and distinct mechanisms of early                blood vessel formation: vasculogenesis forms endothelial cords                  and tubes in place by the cohesion of angioblasts and                           angiogenesis forms new vessels by the migration of sprouts off of               preexisting vessels. A major unsettled issue in how both of these               mechanisms establish embryonic vascular pattern is the extent and               guidance of the directed migration of angioblasts. Dr. Poole's                  hypothesis is that glycoproteins of the extracellular matrix, not               diffusible angiogenic factors, guide the migrations of                          angioblasts which are important in establishing the initial                     vascular pattern. He proposes to use blockages and                              transplantations to determine regions of angioblast migration and               the timing of these migrations. He will transplant fragments of                 quail mesoderm into chick embryos to examine angioblast migratory               capacity in both normally vascular and avascular zones. He will                 use specific antibodies to map the distributions of fibronectin,                laminin and tenascin during early vascular development. He will                 use peptides and antibodies to perturb the adhesion of                          angioblasts to extracellular matrix.                                            %%%                                                                             Vascular development is a crucial early event in the development                of the embryo. Clarifying the roles of cell migration and cell-                 substrate adhesion in vascular development provides information                 of significance both to basic developmental biology and the study               of abnormal vessel growth and proliferation.",
