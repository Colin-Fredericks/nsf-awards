 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our continuing studies of the bacteriophage f1 will be                          concentrated on two areas of phage biology , its DNA                            synthesis and its assembly.  Both of these areas bring to                       the fore the two fundamental biological problems for which                      the study of viruses can be especially useful.  These involve                   questions about the assembly and interaction of multi-protein                   and nucleic acid structures and inquires into the basic                         aspects of the higher order elements of cell metabolism.  We                    have found that the E. coli integration host factor (IHF)                       plays an important role in the synthesis of the phage plus                      (viral) strand.  It appears to act just after the start of                      DNA synthesis, perhaps altering the structure of the DNA so                     that synthesis can proceed.  Available are appropriate mutant                   DNA's, purified IHF and the usual components of DNA synthesis                   to dissect this reaction in detail.  Phage assembly depends                     on the presence and interaction of a cis-acting, phage DNA                      signal and some phage and some host proteins.  These are all                    hand and their interrelationships under study.  Currently, we                   are intrigued by a protein induced in the host by one of the                    phage's morphogenetic proteins, pIV.  This phage shock protein is               being cloned, sequenced and its role in phage and host                          metabolism being ascertained by careful manipulations of this                   E. coli gene.  This protein falls into the class of host                        stress-induced proteins.  Although still obscure, this                          protein may provide the most valuable clue we have to date on                   the role of the phage's gene IV.",
