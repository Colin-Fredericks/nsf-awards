The solution is                                     effected through a comprehensive computer                                       model.                                                                                                                                                          The project involves a collaboration between                                    the University of Alaska's Institute of                                         Marine Science, the Canadian Department of                                      Fisheries and Oceans' Institute of Ocean                                        Sciences, and the National Oceanographic and                                    Atmospheric Administration's Tsunami Warning                                    Center at Palmer, Alaska.                                                                                                                                       Emphasis is given to the final stages of                                        tsunami propagation, namely the runup on the                                    shoreline, and the backwash. Special                                            consideration is given to the hydrodynamical,                                   mathematical, and numerical difficulties                                        connected with the discontinuity between the                                    wet and dry domains, nonlinearity, friction                                     of the propagating wave with the ocean                                          bottom, and computational instability.                                                                                                                          The aim is to develop a robust two-                                             dimensional runup model which can be used to                                    predict reliably the extent of runup along                                      Alaskan and Canadian shores.  This basic                                        information is particularly valuable for                                        tsunami warning and prediction, and is                                          critical for the populated areas around                                         Valdez, Seward, and Homer.",
