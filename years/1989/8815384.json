 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in                                     theoretical physics to be conducted by David                                    Cartwright, George Csanak and Robert Clark of Los                               Alamos National Laboratory and Gilda Meneses and Luis                           Machado of Unicamp in Campinas, Brazil.  The topic is                           the study of inelastic electron scattering by atomic                            and diatomic targets.  They will extend first-order                             many-body theory and the distorted wave approximation                           to the excitation of rare-gas and alkaline earth atoms                          by electron impact.  These calculations will be                                 perfomed on open shell targets such as atomic O, N,                             and F.  In addition, the same techniques will be                                applied to calculations for diatomic molecular                                  targets.  Finally, second-order many-body theory will                           be used to treat both inelastic and elastic electron                            scattering by helium atoms.                                                                                                                                     These theoretical techniques have been developed over                           nine years and three previous collaborations between                            LANL and Unicamp.  This work will extend the                                    theoretical and computational capabilities of both                              groups to more compicated processes of interest in                              plasma physics.  A number of other scientists in both                           laboratories will be involved in the work including                             several students.  The past cooperation has resulted                            in seven graduate degrees and fifteen papers at                                 international conferences.",
