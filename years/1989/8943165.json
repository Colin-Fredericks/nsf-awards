 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the Engineering Research Center for Net Shape                 Manufacturing at Ohio State University is on cost-effective net-                shape manufacturing of discrete parts.  Net shape manufacturing                 intends to produce discrete parts to finish dimensions so that                  little or no machining is required prior to assembly.  The                      integration and optimization of product and process design offer                great opportunities for savings in time, cost, and resources.                   Moreover, net-shape productions (molding, forging, sheet forming,               casting) are major economic forms of production, and advances in                these technologies will make an important contribution to                       national competitiveness.                                                            The goals of the Center are to develop manufacturing                       knowledge and design tools and people trained in net shape design               and manufacturing.  The strategic plan of the center is to create               an integrated design system offering a choice of materials,                     metals or plastics, and manufacturing processes in the design and               production of net-shape parts.                                                       There are four principal thrust areas:  billet forming,                    sheet forming, processing of polymers and composites, and                       precision and die casting.  However, the strategy has been                      refined both as to the concepts and timing for integration.                     Knowledge produced in these areas will be integrated as data                    bases and simulation tools on (1) the behavior of materials, (2)                interface phenomena, (3) mechanics of shape change, and (4)                     characterizations of tooling and machines.  Over the next five                  years, the Center will create a prototype integrated design                     system for net shape manufacturing, utilizing that data and                     simulations.                                                                         The Engineering School has established a graduate program in               Manufacturing and Systems Engineering, of which the Center                      Director is also the Program Director.  The Center is a key                     element in the Engineering School's building up of manufacturing                education and research at Ohio State University.  The Center has                also been innovative in creating a special industrially-sponsored               fellowship program to encourage students with U.S. nationality                  into manufacturing.                                                                  The Center has established a strong working relationship                   with industrial firms, obtaining the sponsorship of 45 firms,                   from large to small, including support from the Society of Die                  Casting Engineers.",
