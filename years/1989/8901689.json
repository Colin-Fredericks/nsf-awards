 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent precision photometric observations of the sun have                  shown it to be a variable star.  Satellite observations of                      integrated sunlight, and ground-based solar limb photometry                     suggest that the luminosity varies by about 0.1% during a solar                 cycle, being brighter when there are more sunspots.  The ground-                based photometry suggests that the latitudinal effective surface                temperature distribution of the sun varies over a solar cycle,                  and this change is not accounted for by the time dependent flux                 excess and deficit of sunspots and ordinary faculae.                                 How does the solar luminosity affect terrestrial climate?                  There is growing statistical evidence that some local measures of               weather are correlated with solar activity.  Since we have just                 noted that solar activity (i.e., sunspot number) is correlated                  with the solar flux, it is appealing to speculate that some                     weather variations are caused by the small flux changes.  The                   Maunder minimum, a time of few sunspots and thus perhaps a                      smaller solar flux, was coincident with a period of colder mean                 temperatures in much of Europe.                                                      The program funded here will 1) extend the precision limb                  photometry measurements to disk center with the comparable                      precision and higher spatial resolution, 2) measure the solar                   cycle variation of the faculae, sunspot, and background thermal                 flux contributions for two years during a period near solar                     maximum.                                                                             The overall aim is to elucidate the mechanism behind solar                 luminosity variations and relate these to solar activity.  It                   might then be possible to reconstruct solar variability over                    recent history and relate that to climate change.",
