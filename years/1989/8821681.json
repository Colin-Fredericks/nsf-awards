 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although religion and race are important factors influencing national           political campaigns, it is only recently that political scientists have         begun to build a theoretical and empirical base to investigate this             topic.  This study investigates the role of religious resources in the          political mobilization of Black Americans.  The recent presidential             candidacy of the Reverend Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988, and the               presidential candidacy of Pat Robertson in 1988, suggest accelerating           involvement of church-based candidates and organizations in the                 political process.  Because of the stronger centrality of religion in           the lives of women, particular attention is placed on understanding the         role of gender in a church-based political mobilization process.  The           major objective of the investigation is to construct a model of church-         based political action among Black women and men which can be tested            empirically.  These political activities will range from church-                centered campaigns to engaging in political protest activities.  A              church-based mobilization framework which draws upon social learning            and resource mobilization theories should advance our knowledge and             understanding of the dynamics which influence the political acitivism           of religious Black women and men.                                                                                                                               The methodology for this project involves secondary analysis of data            from the 1984 National Black Election Study (NBES), a telephone survey          of the Black adult population.  This study includes a pre- and post-            election interview format.  A total of 1,150 respondents were                   interviewed in the pre-election study and 871 were re-interviewed in            the post-election study.  The analysis of these data should increase            substantially our understanding of the role of religious resources in           the political mobilization of Black Americans.",
