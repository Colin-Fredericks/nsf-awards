 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theoretical underpinnings of contemporary ecological                   genetics are mainly borrowed from the literature on quantitative                genetics and the breeding of crop plants and domesticated                       animals.  A number of fundamental issues remain to be resolved                  before the mapping of quantitative genetic methods from the realm               of plant and animal breeding to the less controlled world of                    natural populations can be accomplished.  One of the most serious               difficulties in applying quantitative genetic methods to natural                populations is that one of the assumptions of this approach is                  that the members of the population under study are mating at                    random.  This is an assumption that is unlikely to be fulfilled                 in most natural populations.  When there are complex forms of                   genetic variation, such as interactions among genes at different                loci, violation of the assumption of random mating may have                     profound effects on the potential for evolutionary changes to                   occur.                                                                               This research will use Plantago lanceolata to examine the                  role of population subdivision and localized mating in                          influencing estimates of the genetic variation in a population,                 and the potential for selection to bring about evolutionary                     change.  The basic approach will be to compare genetic variance                 components estimated in a population by using the resemblance                   among relatives when the parents are chosen based on their                      probability of mating in the nature with similar estimates of                   genetic variance components when the parents are chosen at random               from the population at large.  If estimates of the genetic                      variance components under these two mating systems are different                it will indicate that the mating structure can have a strong                    influence on the potential for evolutionary change to occur.  If                they are different the estimates based on localized mating, which               are expected to be larger, will give the best predictions of the                response to selection.",
