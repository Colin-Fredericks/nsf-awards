 "awd_abstract_narration": "The occurrence of a Class F4 \"devastating tornado\" in the                  old-growth forest of the Tionesta Scenic Area provides a unique                 opportunity to study the effects of catastrophic wind disturbance               on forest regeneration.  Such events, although critical to the                  organization of mesic broadleaved forest, have been studied only                rarely, particularly in old-growth forest.  It is proposed that                 castastrophic wind disturbance in old-growth forest should                      produce much patchiness, which will have a lasting effect on                    regeneration.  The patchiness at several scales, including the                  previously unstudied fine scale on which plants become                          established and first interact will be measured.  How the                       patterns of patches change will be determined in close spatial                  and temporal detail and their biological significance, using both               environmental measurement and experimental modification of                      patches will be evaluated.  Although the details of patchiness                  and regeneration are likely to be unique to each disturbance and                site, this research will provide a mechanistic basis for                        generalization about catastrophic disturbances.",
