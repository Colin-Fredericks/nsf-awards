Dailey III at the University of                  Pennsylvania. The research deals with the synthesis and                         reaction behavior of fluorinated carbenes with the major goal                   of achieving a detailed understanding of the chemical bonding                   and reactivity of high energy compounds and reactive                            intermediates.                                                                                                                                                  Reactivity and direct spectroscopic detection of singlet                        carbenes which have the opportunity to undergo                                  1,2-rearrangements, such as ethylidenes and                                     methylidenecarbenes, are of particular interest. Judicious                      substitution of fluorine on the carbene will slow or inhibit                    rearrangement thereby making the carbenes observable under                      matrix isolation conditions. The synthesis and reactivity of                    novel carbene precursors including diazirines and propadienones                 will also be explored. Theoretical calculations will be used as                 a tool to probe the chemistry and reactivity of the various                     systems to be studied.",
