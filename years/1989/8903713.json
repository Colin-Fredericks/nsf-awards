 "awd_abstract_narration": "The World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) will require                      measurements of ocean surface currents over long periods of                     time and in different ocean conditions.  Several low cost                       drifters have been developed and successively deployed in the                   tropics where their water following characteristics are well                    understood.  However they have not yet been used or tested in                   high latitudes where wind and weather conditions are more                       severe.  Four drifters will be modified to have different                       drag area ratios and outfitted with current meters.  They                       will be deployed for two-week periods in late 1989 near                         existing weather buoys in the North Pacific.  After recovery,                   data from the flow of water past the drifters will be                           analyzed as a function of wind speed and drag area.  Sixteen                    other identical drifters will be deployed in October 1989 and                   groups will be recovered in three-month intervals through                       rough winter weather to assess wear and survivability.                                                                                                          The data on water-mass tracking, when taken with data from                      existing tropical calibration studies will provide an                           assessment of the drifters' performance across the range of                     wind and current variables anticipated in WOCE field                            programs.  The survivability and wear observations will allow                   improvements in design of mechanical components to withstand                    prolonged exposure to upper ocean environments in the mid-                      and high latitudes.  A large number of drifters will be built                   and deployed during WOCE field programs.  This study is                         essential to the selection of effective drifters.  It is a                      joint project between the Scripps Institution of Oceanography                   and the Institute of Ocean Sciences in Canada.",
