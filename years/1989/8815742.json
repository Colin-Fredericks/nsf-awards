 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the work of Prof.                   Anthony Barrett of Northwestern University.  Prof. Barrett is                   studying how  metals connected to carbon, organometallic                        compounds, can provide unique methods for preparing                             structurally complex molecules.  The project will study the                     details of how these organometallic compounds react,  and the                   limitations of their use.  Special attention will focus on                      methods for making chemical ring compounds.  Ring-containing                    compounds are common to Nature, and one of the important                        missions of organic chemists is to find new ways to build, in                   the laboratory, the  kinds of compounds that can be found in                    Nature.                                                                                                                                                         The application of cationic iron\u0131II! vinylidene reagents to the                 construction of a diversity of heterocyclic and carbocyclic                     molecules will be investigated.  The reactions will be focused                  on novel cyclization approaches to heterocyclic and carbocyclic                 rings.  The research will explore the fundamental questions of                  the mode of reactivity of the organometallic reagents.  As the                  scope of the newly-developing technology becomes known, the                     methods will be applied to  designing efficient routes to                       molecular skeletons of  interest to synthetic organic chemists.",
