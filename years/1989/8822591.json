 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Jacob                Weiner, Swarthmore College and Dr. Michael J. Crawey, Imperial                  College at Silwood Park, England.  The objective of the project is              to examine the interactions between competition and herbivory in                determining the size variability in plant populations.  This will               be accomplished in two ways.  First, the investigators will execute             a large multifactoral experiment which will look at the effects and             interactions between plant density and slug herbivory on size                   distributions in greenhouse populations of white clover.  This will             enable them to test several hypotheses about the influence of                   herbivory on plant size distributions, and how the effects of                   herbivory are mediated by competition between plants.  Second, the              investigators will use new statistical methods to analyze large                 data sets which have been collected over several years at Silwood               Park on the effect of rabbit herbivory on populations of winter                 wheat.  This will submit the hypotheses to the more rigorous test               of field conditions.                                                                                                                                            This project will combine Dr. Crawley's expertise with herbivory                and Dr. Weiner's expertise in the analysis of plant population                  structure.  The performance of this study at Silwood Park is                    particularly important, due to the strong research faculty                      present.  The results of this research will contribute to our                   understanding of the mechanisms that produce size variation in                  plant population.",
