 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the              subfields of electrocatalysis and electrochemical synthesis.  A                 novel high surface area lead dioxide electrode will be prepared,                characterized and employed in this Phase I research effort for a                variety of organic electrochemical processes.  High surface area                carbons of high oxidation stability will be used as the substrate               on which lead dioxide will be deposited from strongly acidic                    media.  The effectiveness of the high surface area lead dioxide                 relative to that of planar lead dioxide will be evaluated for the               regeneration of Cr(VI) and Ce(IV).  The Cr(VI) and Ce(IV) will                  then be used for the \"extra-cell\" synthesis of naphthoquinone and               anthraquinone.                                                                                                                                                  The number of stable, inexpensive, electrocatalytic anode                       materials available for the electrosynthesis of chemicals is quite              limited.  It is expected that the high surface area lead dioxide                electrode will provide superior performance when compared to                    planar lead dioxide.  The use of stable, inexpensive, high surface              area lead dioxide anodes may provide higher selectivity and                     stability than presently utilized anodes, thereby allowing lower                capital and operating costs for the electrochemical synthesis of                various organic chemicals via regeneration of Cr(VI) and Ce(IV).",
