 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kalton's research project continues his                          investigation of mathematical objects encountered at a fairly                   high level of abstraction in analysis. At the most concrete level               of this subject, one is concerned with summing series,                          integrating functions, solving differential equations, and the                  like. Moving up a notch in generality, it has been found to be                  advantageous to amalgamate the analytic objects one is dealing                  with into what are called Banach spaces (in the most favorable                  situations) or other sorts of linear spaces. These spaces in turn               can be studied either individually, or along the lines of a                     general theory. The present project deals with spaces that are                  related to Banach spaces but do not fit strictly within that                    category.                                                                            There is for instance a construction called the twisted sum                that is most naturally viewed in a much larger category of                      functional analytic objects than that of Banach spaces. Two of                  the latter can have a twisted sum that is not even locally                      convex. Kalton will study decomposition and extension properties                defined with respect to twisted sum, and the connections of this                notion with interpolation theory. His methods are expected to                   have repercussions for problems usually approached just from                    within the Banach space context.",
