 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will initiate studies on sperm plasma membrane lipids             and continue previous studies on the possible role of zinc in bat               sperm longevity by pursuing the effect on sperm of the removal of               these substances.  Dr. Crichton has documented the presence of zinc in          large quantities in sperm filled storage organs and she hypothesizes            that long lived bat sperm may be rendered particularly resistant to             prefertilization changes by inherent components that perhaps are                altered at ovulation as a function of either the environmental milieu           at the time, or as a programmed, time dependent result of their long            stay in the female tract.  In separate experiments, she will remove             cholesterol and zinc from these cells in vitro, and test their                  viability and fertilizability by examining the status of the acrosome           and by recording their metabolism and their ability to decondense               within the ooplasm.  The results of these studies should yield                  information on the role of sperm-bound lipids and zinc in sperm                 longevity in bats which, in turn, might answer questions on the                 regulatory mechanism of sperm storage.  The elucidation of the                  mechanisms underlying sperm storage in bats holds a key to the                  answers of many questions in mammalian sperm biology.  The possibility          of controlling sperm longevity would have significant application to            fertility and sterility problems in man and his agricultural animals.                                                                                           Interactive activities include forming a Reproductive Biology journal           club, teaching a graduate course on the corpus luteum and participate           in teaching an Electron Microscopy course, a course in Gamete Biology           and one in Histology.  In addition, Dr. Crichton will attend faculty            meetings and present a seminar.                                                                                                                                 This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2) to encourage women          to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing greater               visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in industry,             government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the                      participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
