 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel fiber optic probe will be developed and then used to                    investigate:  (1) the movement of solutes through a support matrix and          (2) the intrinsic kinetics of solute binding by immobilized ligands.            The probe is an optical fiber employing an evanescent wave to excite            molecules at the fiber surface; the electromagnetic field which is the          wave penetrates only 2000 angstroms into the surrounding medium, and            can be used to study the molecules at the surface of the optical                fiber.  In the second part of the project, the waveguide will be                coated with a very thin film of a support matrix and the rate of                movement of solutes of interest through an affinity column will be              determined.  This will allow separation of mass transfer and                    equilibrium effects by direct measurement.  Thus, the influence of the          nature of the support matrix and the method of ligand attachment can            be unambiguously determined.  This knowledge will be of considerable            importance in affinity, chromatography, a separation technique with             applications in biotechnology.                                                                                                                                  Affinity-based separations are an important technique for the recovery          of biological products.  Though extensively studied, most                       investigations have been at the macroscopic level; for example, some            studies have used frontal analysis or pulse techniques from                     chromatography theory.  This project will attempt a study of factors            affecting binding constants and mass transfer rates from a microscopic          perspective.",
