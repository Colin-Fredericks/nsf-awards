 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National                  Science Foundation, Dr. Karen Strier will continue her long-term                study of the endangered woolly spider monkey of southeastern                    Brazil.  What makes this species unusual is the apparent lack of                competition among adult members of the same sex, and Dr. Strier                 wishes to determine the reasons for this.  Since 1982, systematic               data has been collected on demography and life history variables                and on the distribution and availability of food resources.                     Attention has also been focused on how communication is employed                to mediate social relationships.  Dr. Strier recently added a                   comparative aspect to this research and began observation of a                  second population in a different forest which differs in size,                  floral, and faunal composition.  With NSF support she will                      continue this research.                                                                                                                                         This work is important for several reasons.  It will increase the               knowledge of an endangered primate species and directly assist in               its conservation.  It will also provide comparative data to                     further our understanding of primate behavioral adaptations.  It                will also assist in the professional development of an extremely                promising young scientist.",
