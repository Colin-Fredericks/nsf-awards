 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social regulation of reproduction is the foundation of colony                   organization in social insects.  Yet so little is known about the               basic process of oogenesis itself, it is difficult to do more                   than guess what physiological processes are blocked to result in                sterility.  The long-term objective of the proposed research is                 to define the endocrine basis of oogenesis in social insects and                to identify the mechanisms by which reproductive females                        sterilize in nestmates.  Workers of the ant genus Camponotus                    present many features that make an in-depth study of oogenesis                  and its inhibition feasible.  In the first year of the project,                 the investigator will define oogenesis and its inhibition in                    workers phenomenologically and morphologically.  She will produce               antibody to vitellogenin (Vg.) and use it in the study of Vg                    synthesis in vivo.  Honeybee Vg and Vg antibody will be used to                 develop protocols that can be applied to ants.  Next, in vivo                   endocrine studies (e.g., assay of ecdysteroid titers, effects of                exogenous juvenile hormone on oogenesis) will begin.  A                         defined culture medium for in vitro studies and an antibody-based               assay for quantification of Vg will be developed.  Then, the                    investigator will begin in vitro studies on Vg synthesis by fat                 body.  During the third year of the proposed research, the                      responsiveness of fat bodies in different physiological states to               hormonal challenges will be determined.  The investigator will                  test the feasibility of studying the role of the ovary, including               ecdysteroid secretion and Vg uptake, in vitro.",
