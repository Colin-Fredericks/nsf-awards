 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to limit a systematic study of the            tradeoff between structural simplicity and expected performance in              combinatorial algorithms.  In this research, the attention is                   restricted to some fundamental algorithmic problems on words (or                strings).  One goal is that of testing to what extent simpler and more          direct algorithms can be expected in practice to match performance of           more complicated, asymptotically faster ones.  (In general,                     straightforward algorithms are not only more easily designed, but also          more easily encoded, debugged, documented, upgraded etc.)  Another goal         is that of discovering entirely new algorithms on words that would              represent good compromises in terms of structural complexity, expected          performance and worst-case performance.  A third goal is that of                identifying novel cost measures for at least some classes of                    algorithms, possibly along with new analysis-design methodologies.",
