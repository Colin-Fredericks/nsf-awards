 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the investigator is conducting research on the                 survivability of the human immunodeficiency virus, Type 1 (HIV-1) in            domestic wastewater and environmental waters into which untreated and           treated domestic wastes can be placed.  In this research, the                   investigator plans to conduct laboratory work involving the incubation          of domestic wastes and environmental waters that have been                      contaminated with HIV-1 isolates to determine the survival                      characteristics of this virus when subjected to this environmental              stress.  The viability of recovered virus will be determined by co-             cultivation with treated normal human lymphocytes using antigen                 capture and reverse-transcriptase assays as viral growth determinants.                                                                                          This proposal was submitted under conditions outlined in NSF 87-90,             Expedited Awards for Novel Research.  Results of this exploratory               project are expected to provide the basis for any further research              that is warranted on determination of the nature of the potential               impact of the HIV-1 virus on environmental resources and to provide             insights into the impact of the results on environmental engineering            design of processes and control systems to deal with this potential             environmental contaminant.",
