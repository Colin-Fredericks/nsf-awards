Requested funds would           cover preparation for the meeting, the costs of travel, per diem and            organizational expenses of the meeting for the NRC group only.                  The purpose of the meeting and its preparatory research is to compare           and contrast the nature of precompetitive research in Japan and the             United States in the specific fields of biotechnology and optoelectr-           onics.  It is further designed to assess the conditions of foreign              access to researchers and facilities involved in these fields in the            two countries and to evaluate whether access in the two countries is            \"comparable.\"                                                                   SIGNIFICANCE:  The Deputy Director, NSF and the Director, International         Programs Division, have reviewed and recommended funding of this                proposal for its timeliness and direct relevance to the suggestion of           the Task Force on Access (a standing body under the U.S.-Japan S&T              Agreement) that U.S. study teams be funded by the U.S. government to            evaluate conditions of access by U.S. researchers to Japanese S&T in            those fields enumerated in the U.S.-Japan S&T Agreement.                        The government-furnished portion of the project costs will be cost-             shared with the National Institutes of Health.",
