 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is an investigation of how the properties of antarctic snow          grains affect spectral and angular variations in the reflectance pattern        of solar radiation in the visible and near-infrared bands.  The project         will increase our understanding of the optical properties of the                antarctic ice sheet, and will provide a quantitative data base for polar        terrestrial and planetary remote sensing applications.  The goal of this        research is to develop empirical and quantitative methods which can be          used to relate satellite-based and other remotely sensed measurements to        the microphysical of the snow surface.                                                                                                                          The project has implications that extend to the climatology of                  Antarctica since surface temperatures in the interior are determined to         a great extent by the optical properties of the snow.  The antarctic            snow surface is moreover much more stable than mid-latitude alpine snow         surfaces since there is little or no diurnal variation in the elevation         of the sun.  The antarctic snow and ice sheet is also less contaminated         with soot and other deposited aerosols then non-polar snow surfaces.                                                                                            The project is well-designed, builds upon the existing data base, and is        a necessary component in the development of interpretation algorithms           for aircraft and satellite observations.",
