 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sun is frequently thought of as a star in hydrostatic                       equilibrium, which means that the inward force of gravity is                    balanced everywhere by the outward force of pressure.  The                      assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is, however, just a                       first-order approximation, particularly in its surface layers.                  There, convection, sunspots cycles, magnetic fields, energetic                  outbursts (e.g., flares) reveal a rather dynamic, cyclic, as                    well as chaotic behavior.  This proposal focuses on continuing                  with observations of the sun's global surface velocity fields                   and magnetic fields that have been in progress for the past 21                  years.  The principal investigator will also interpret the                      observations, which is difficult and controversial at present.                  The contribution of this work, about which there is no                          controversy, is that a priceless data base of solar surface                     activity, already two decades in the making, will be extended.",
