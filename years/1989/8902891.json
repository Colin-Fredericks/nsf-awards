 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop a \"work in                           preparation\" (PREP) editor, a multi-user environment to support a                                                                                               variety of collaborative and, and in particular, co-authoring and                                                                                               commenting relationships for scholarly communication.  The editor                                                                                               is designed to facilitate the intensive study of co-authoring and                                                                                               commenting relationships across local and remote electronic                     networks.  The PI's focus on scholarly communities because they                 are already collaborative work groups.  They are not explicitly                 organized around single, concrete goals, but members of groups                  share the common goal of advancing the state of knowledge.  Such                work groups are organized in local settings, but they also                      interact intensively at a distance, as members of a common                      \"invisible college.\"  Enhancing the effectiveness of this                       loosely-coupled collaboration is an important function for the                  tools developed under this research. The project has scientific                 significance in computer science, psychology, and organizational                communication.  In communication and organizational psychology,                 the project contributes to the further refinement and test of a                 collaborative model of how groups usefully interact when working                                                                                                together as co-authors and commenters.  In computer science, the                                                                                                project provides a proof of concept test for editing systems that                                                                                               support structured collaboration among authors as well as the                                                                                                   efficient management of large volumes of comments that external                                                                                                 commenters can make of authors; working drafts.",
