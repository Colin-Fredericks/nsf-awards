 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project a computer system using two cameras as eyes will                be developed to recognize sign language vocabulary in real time.                The theory and method, called orientation chain coding, used in                 the realization of this system have been studied and analyzed.                  Preliminary simulation results show that this method is a                       feasible and efficient algorithm for sign language recognition.                 The results of this project will enable the realization of a                    functioning prototype sign language interpreter.  The developed                 system could be used as a computer sign language interpreter to                 help deaf persons talk to people who do not understand sign                     language.  The systems can be set up at schools, homes, and                     public service organizations.  It could also be further developed               as a computer teaching aid to help deaf students learn special                  courses or skills.  All deaf persons and our society will benefit               from the development of such a computer system.",
