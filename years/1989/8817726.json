The new collections include major holdings of               chitons and sea slugs.  In addition, adjunct materials such as                  color transparencies, microscope slides, and publications were                  donated with the collections, increasing their value to                         researchers.  Identifications of the donated specimens will be                  made by visiting experts partially supported by the project.  The               Academy will also begin to re-curate its previous collections of                these two groups that are preserved in liquid; such wet                         specimens contain the soft body parts lost in traditional dry                   mollusc preparations and thus are extremely useful.  Finally,                   computerization of collection data for the mollusks, begun in a                 previous award, will continue.",
