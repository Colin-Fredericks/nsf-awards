 "awd_abstract_narration": "The neostriatum is a brain region integrally involved in body                   movement.  Advances in neostriatal research have revealed much                  about its complex neural inputs and intrinsic organization,                     including the identification and localization of chemical                       messengers that activate or inhibit other neurons.  The molecular               events in neostriatal cells which process the effects of the                    chemical messengers are poorly understood, but are important to                 understand how these cells convey information.  One of these                    fundamental cellular processes--called signal transduction of                   chemical messengers--uses a class of proteins, GTP-binding                      proteins, to mediate and direct the flow of information by                      chemical messengers.  The overall objective of this study is to                 examine the cellular localization, regulation and action of                     specific GTP-binding, transducing proteins in the rat                           neostriatum.  Investigating where signal transducing proteins are               localized subcellulary in neostriatal neurons, how these proteins               are activated, and what intraneuronal processes they affect                     should advance the knowledge of cellular mechanisms involved in                 neuronal targeting of information in the neostriatum.",
