Anthony and Alice Echelle of Oklahoma State University                will use biochemical data to study the evolutionary relationships               of the freshwater pupfishes of North America.  The group includes               the pupfishes of the genus Cyprinodon (35 species) and five small               genera (1-2 species each) of related fishes.  The work emphasizes               the use of protein variation analyzed by electrophoresis to                     describe genealogical relatedness among the genera and among the                22 \"inland\" species of pupfish, followed by the use of                          mitochondrial DNA variation to describe relationships within a                  small subset of species, the Death Valley pupfishes and their                   nearest relatives.                                                                   Pupfishes constitute the most diverse group of fishes in the               three major warm deserts of North America: Mohave, Sonoran, and                 Chihuahuan.  The numerous desert-dwelling pupfish species and                   the deserts they inhabit have developed in relatively recent                    geological time.  Thus, knowledge of phylogenetic relationships                 among pupfishes should provide considerable insight into the                    biogeography of southwestern United States and northern Mexico.                 The pupfishes also provide an unusual opportunity to test                       different modes of speciation.  A number of pupfishes and the one               species of the related genus Megupsilon are threatened with                     probable extinction in the near future.  One outcome of the                     proposed work is to produce frozen collections of tissues for                   future biochemical work.",
