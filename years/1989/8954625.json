 "awd_abstract_narration": "Horizon Research Inc. and faculty from the University of                        North Carolina (UNC) will develop and implement a teacher                       enhancement model for middle school earth science teachers.                     A \"Topics In Earth Science Course\" will be developed for use                    in the in-service workshops.  Materials for the course will                     be drawn from the many excellent though widely dispersed                        curriculum materials available.  The course will have a total                   of 90 hours of earth science instruction so that in-service                     leaders will be able to select those components that best                       match the needs and interests of a particular group of                          teachers.  These leader team in-service programs will also                      emphasize and use instructional methodologies which research                    has shown enables students to learn most effectively.  Course                   materials will be field tested in local districts.  Topics                      will be included from geology, astronomy, oceanography and                      meteorology.                                                                                                                                                    Initially, nine two-person leader teams participate in an                       intensive two-week workshop at UNC.  One member is a middle                     school earth science teacher the other a science supervisor                     with experience in in-service education delivery.  Then these                   leader                                                                          teams will polish their skills delivering 2 two-week sessions,                  each with 18 underprepared teachers at UNC.  Finally, each team                 will provide in-service workshops on-site, customized to local                  needs, for 30 teachers in groups of 10.  Throughout the workshops               leader teams continue to receive support from project staff.  The               leader team workshops begin July, 1990 following development of                 the topics course in September, 1989.  All project activities                   will be guided by a National Advisory Panel of distinguished                    scientists and educators.                                                                                                                                       Key features of the in-service model are:  the ability to                       customize the on-site in-service workshop based on local needs,                 the continued support provided to the leadership teachers and the               model's resulting transportability.  Area districts have made                   commitments to provide leader teams and funding support for the                 on-site workshops.                                                                                                                                              I strongly recommend a standard award for 24 months in the amount               of $483,968.  There is cost sharing in the amount of $151,578                   which is equal to 31% of the NSF award.",
