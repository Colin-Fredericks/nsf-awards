 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arizona State University will conduct The Hispanic Math Project (HMP)           which has as a major goal to promote the achievements of migrant                Hispanic elementary students in mathematics - focusing specifically on          the mathematics of measurement.  The Hispanic Math Project will be an           interactive active video, computer-based learning station to be used            with Limited English Proficiency (LEP) students.                                                                                                                The math content will be presented by using the formula of form,                function and use via multiple media.  Audio (spoken language), videodisc        (visual), and written language text will interact and enforce one               another to provide a near real-life environment for the child.  The             Integrated Whole Language approach is the theoretical base for the              development of the Hispanic Math Project.  The learning station's expert        system maintains language transparency and provides a natural language          interface, which will promote an optimal environment for Hispanic               students learning mathematics content.                                                                                                                          Another important contribution that HMP will provide for migrant                Hispanic students is a continuity of performance record through the             Migrant Student Record Transfer System (MSRTS).  By utilizing the MSRTS         mathematics objectives as the basis for the interactive tutorial                materials, HMP can establish a clearly defined, transferable profile of         a student's math skill level regardless of where the student is within          the United States.                                                                                                                                              In summary, the project will develop and explore whether an expert              system can interact as a partner and guide to ameliorate math illiteracy        for a growing number of minority students.",
