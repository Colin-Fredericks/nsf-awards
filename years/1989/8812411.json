 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the interaction between cloud                      systems, land surfaces and radiation within the Southwest-East                  Asian Monsoon.  It represents an ongoing effort under NSF                       sponsorship to apply satellite radiance and radiation budget                    measurements to current problems in monsoon science involving                   both interannual and intraseasonal aspects of monsoon behavior                  and heat sources and sinks.  The foremost scientific objectives                 of the proposed research are twofold:                                                                                                                           A)  Utilize INSAT geosynchronous satellite measurements to                      determine how the development and movement of deep organized                    convection and tropical storms within the Asian monsoon regulate                the amplitude and phase propagation characteristics of                          cloudiness anomalies associated with low frequency intraseasonal                oscillations.  Investigate how the movement and fluctuations of                 the predominant heat source regions within tropical storms                      controls the dimensions, orientation, and amplitude of the Indian               Ocean-Western Pacific dipole designating the major source region                of low frequency oscillations.  Develop medium spectral                         resolution radiative transfer models, which incorporate INSAT                   measurements to prescribe cloudiness for parameterized cloud                    calculations.  Diagnose the modulation of the vertical radiative                flux divergence profiles fluctuations.  Decompose the vertical                  structure of the low frequency oscillations in conjunction with                 these profiles.                                                                                                                                                 B)  With the aid of INSAT and AVHRR satellite measurements, and                 the TIPMEX-86 surface measurements, show how variations in                      surface boundary conditions throughout the region of the Tibet                  Plateau, during the transition into and throughout the course of                the summer monsoon, lead to large diurnally forced gradients in                 the radiative flux divergence profiles.  Investigate how the                    northward penetration of the low frequency monsoon episodes                     across the Himalayan barrier diminish the role of surface                       forcing, replacing it with a cloud forced radiation profile                     structure.                                                                                                                                                           This research is important because it has the potential of                 providing new knowledge of how the Asian monsoon system, the most               energetic regional circulation on earth, is related to other                    global weather and climate systems, including those affecting the               United States.",
