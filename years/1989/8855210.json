The project will                    instruct                                                                        the participants in the principles of scientific reasoning while                offering them a hands-on experience involving basic laboratory                  skills                                                                          and techniques germane to many areas of science.

The ongoing proposed project encompasses two major phases: a                    summer                                                                          immersion experience and an academic-year research project.  The                summer                                                                          immersion experience is a four week program designed to give the                participant broad-based instruction and laboratory experience in                several essential areas of science.  This session is organized                  into six                                                                        modules: Orientation to the Science, Chemistry, Physics,Life                    Sciences                                                                        and Biotechnology, Ecology and Geology, and a one day Transition                module.  In addition to subject matter content, each of the                     modules                                                                         will integrate such topics as scientific method, research                       techniques,                                                                     career choices in science, and the role of ethics in science.

Following the immersion experience, each student will                select                                                                          a one semester research project under the sponsorship of faculty                mentors from SUNY  Plattsburgh and the Miner Research Institute.                The                                                                             research project will employ the skills learned during the summer               immersion experience and extend the participant's interest and                  knowledge in a particular area of science.  Written reports and                 oral                                                                            presentations will aid in the development of scientific literacy                and the                                                                         articulation of scientific knowledge to others.  In an effort to                insure                                                                          diversified participation among secondary school students in this               region, the project will create a collaboration between                         university and                                                                  secondary school science faculty.",
