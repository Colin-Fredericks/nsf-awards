 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with three related                                    issues affecting the seismic structures,                                        particularly steel structures.  The first one                                   is the incremental collapse issue, which may                                    arise when a structure has inadequate                                           strength and inelastic stiffness to prevent                                     continuous drifting of the structure due to                                     P-delta effects.  The second issue is the                                       column strength requirements under gravity                                      plus seismic design loads, considering the                                      interaction between axial loads and bending                                     moments.  The third issue is column buckling                                    under overloads during earthquakes.                                                                                                                             The objective of the research is to                                             investigate these problems and to develop                                       feasible solutions.  Parameter studies                                          through computer simulation will be performed                                   to account for the effects of the geometric                                     and material nonlinearities involved                                            research.  The results of the study will be                                     presented in the form of design                                                 recommendations that can be readily                                             implemented in engineering practice.  The                                       study will improve the current code design or                                   seismic stability of steel frames.",
