 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in Science, Technology and Society supports research  and               educational projects that examine the social, political,                        intellectual and economic contexts that influence the direction                 and use of science and technology.  Ethics and Values Studies                   supports projects that examine the social, professional and                     individual values and mutual obligations and responsibilities                   that arise in interactions of science, technology and society.                  This project provides partial support for the scholarship needed                to prepare a thorough and expanded revision of the entire first                 edition of the Encyclopedia of Bioethics.  Users of the                         Encyclopedia include students and teachers in professional,                     graduate, undergraduate and high schools; professionals;                        researchers; public policy makers and the general public.  This                 basic award-winning reference work was published by Macmillan in                1978.  Since that time, there have been enormous changes and                    advances in the life sciences, including biotechnology and                      bioengineering, requiring major revisions to the entries in the                 current work.  In addition, the revised edition will be more                    thoroughly and explicitly concerned with all branches of science                that deal with living organisms and life processes.  It will be                 more attentive to ethical issues in life sciences such as                       agriculture, genetics (including bioengineering), behavioral and                social sciences, ecological sciences and biomedical technologies,               as well as their implications for science and engineering                       education.   Foundational problems related to the cultural impact               of the life sciences and technology and the philosophy of science               and engineering that influence the ethical responses will be                    examined.  This expansion requires the development and                          integration of new sub-areas and topics into the work.  Most of                 the support for this project is provided by the publisher; funds                from this award will enable the additional scholarly effort that                is needed to proceed expeditiously.                                                                                                                             This project will contribute to the development of a basic                      resource in bioethics, for use by scholars, students, and                       publics.  The principal investigator and his advisors are very                  well qualified; prior results have been very meritorious and well               received.  Institutional and other support is good and costs are                reasonable.  The project has high priority for support.",
