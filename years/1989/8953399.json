 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with scientists from the Monsanto Company and other            area industries, the Mathematics and Science Education Center of the            Cooperating School Districts of St. Louis, Inc., will develop and help          biology teachers introduce biotechnology units into their classes.              Because it is a relatively new area and most biology teachers have not          had experience with it, this highly important and rapidly developing            field of biology is seldom included in current classes at the pre-              college level. However, teaching materials for grades 9-12 have already         been written and piloted by the Center; these will be finalized and             teachers will be trained in their use so that they can be broadly               introduced into St. Louis area schools.  Complementary materials for the        6th grade will be developed and tested in actual classroom use.                 Materials for the 7th and 8th grades will be developed in a subsequent          project.                                                                                                                                                        Though the materials are being developed and proven in St. Louis schools        working with local scientists and engineers, they will be available for         national dissemination when classroom-proven.  Initial dissemination            will be undertaken in this project by introducing the materials into            classrooms in other cities where Monsanto has plants and laboratories.                                                                                          Cost sharing by the partners will total 93% of the National Science             Foundation funding.",
