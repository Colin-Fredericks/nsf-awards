 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcite (CaCO3) is one of the most prevalent of boiler and heat                 exchanger scale.  Recent work has shown that trace concentrations of            divalent iron (Fe2+) very strongly inhibit the growth of CaC03,                 suggesting that iron of the appropriate form and in sufficient                  concentration can lead to a significant reduction in the amount and             tenacity of such scale deposits.  It is proposed to examine how iron            and other metal cations affect the nucleation and growth of a variety           of scale-forming carbonate minerals, and how various solution                   parameters enhance or suppress crystallization.  A model will be                developed to predict carbonate crystal growth inhibition, and                   electrolytic and magnetic means of introducing the metal cations into           solution will be examined.                                                                                                                                      The build up of scale deposits inside cooling water pipes and boilers           is a multimillion dollar problem.  Scale significantly reduces heat             transfer efficiency and can lead to blockage of water flow passages.            Understanding the mechanisms by which metal ions inhibit crystal                nucleation and growth can lead to cost effective means of maintaining           peak performance of heat exchange equipment.",
