 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to establish the Califorinia Education                 and Research Federation Network (CERFnet), a regional network in                California, which will provide enhanced communication among                     researchers and the significant resources made available through                NSFNET.                                                                              CERFnet will provide the needed high-speed access to the                   supercomputer resources, national data bases, and specialized                   software at the NSF sponsored supercomputer centers and between                 groups of researchers as they collaborate.  While some of the                   CERF members currently have medium-speed (56,000 bits per                       second) access to the NSFNET Backbone, a substantial increase in                bandwidth (to 1.5 million bits per second) and connectivity is                  needed to encourage usage by making access easy, fast, and                      inexpensive.                                                                         The research support to be provided by this federation in                  the form of training, consulting, documentation, seminars, and                  improved communications is an important element in making                       supercomputer resources more accessible to academic and                         industrial institutions in California and to provide the                        infrastructure for collaborative research and education                         projects.",
