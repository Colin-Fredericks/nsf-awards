 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to develop computing infrastructure for a         wide variety of research, with the primary areas being equational               logic, case-based reasoning, computer vision and graphics, numerical            solution of partial differential equations, and computer science                theory.  The infrastructure to be set up will include a VLSI design             facility to be used by students and faculty in developing and testing           circuit designs.  This facility will be used be used by a number of             other research projects.                                                                                                                                        The research in equational logic is concerned with the development of           useful implementations of an equational logic programming.  The                 following issues will be addressed: compiler optimizations, radical new         implementation techniques based on congruence closure, extensions of            the language to provide modularity, implementation of indeterminate             systems without the Church-Rosser property, more powerful techniques            for guaranteeing determinacy, more flexible input-output interfaces             integrating equational programming with structure editors and                   debuggers, and parallel evaluation of equational programs.                                                                                                      The research on case-based reasoning is concerned with the analysis and         implementation of reasoning by remembering previous results and                 adapting them to new situations.  This approach will be applied to four         projects: evaluating student applications, diagnosing mechanical                failures, routing delivery vehicles, and tutoring high school students          in geometry.                                                                                                                                                    The research on computer vision and graphics involves the study of a            new efficient general purpose algorithm for recognizing polyhedral              objects in arbitrary orientations.   Practical applicability of the             algorithm will be tested and generalizations of the algorithm will be           investigated.                                                                                                                                                   The research on numerical solutions of partial differential equations           involves several projects dealing with particle methods, multigrid              methods, variational inequalities, and superconvergent recovery of              information in finite element methods.  The research also involves              studying operator-splitting and time-splitting methods for the                  simulation of fluid flow in porous media, and dealing with                      singularities in solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.                                                                                                      The theoretical areas of research include complexity theory and                 algorithms, programming language semantics, recursion theory, and the           application of recursion theoretic concepts and techniques to the               theoretical foundations of learning.",
