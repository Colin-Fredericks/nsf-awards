 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mating interaction, surface to surface interaction is                      prevalent in mechanical devices.  It is a functional primitive                  from which complex mechanical function is synthesized.                          Transmission of power, of heat, and of fluids are examples of                   areas where the complex function of a device can be reduced to                  primitives based on the concept of mating.                                           The purpose of the proposed work is to study how a certain                 kind of mechanical function, namely that which can be reduced to                mating interaction, can be represented by constraint based                      languages.  We will investigate how mating of mechanical parts                  can be represented by mating constraints and how synthesis of                   mechanical function from mating primitives can be represented by                the hierarchical composition of the mating constraints of a                     constraint model.                                                                    Our work will follow the theoretical/experimental                          methodology of artificial intelligence, exploratory programming.                The research will be centered on a computational realization of                 the constraint paradigm, since this paradigm can formally                       represent the intuitive notions of mating interaction and those                 of functional decomposition and synthesis used in mechanical                    design.",
