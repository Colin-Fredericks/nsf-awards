 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conceptual change has been a significant component of all major                 changes of theory in science.  Attempts by philosophers and                     historians of science to characterize conceptual change have led                to two main views:  conceptual change is continuous and                         cumulative and conceptual change is discontinuous and abrupt.                   Dr. Nersessian has found, however, that fine-structure analyses                 of transition periods between theories show both                                characterizations to be inadequate.  Conceptual change is                       continuous but not simply cumulative.  Providing an explanatory                 account for the historical data requires an investigation into                  the dynamics of how conceptual structures change.                                                                                                               With the support of this grant, Dr. Nersessian will examine                     actual conceptual changes in science in light of cognitive                      theories of heuristic reasoning, conceptualization and                          categorization, and conceptual change.  The extent of fit between               these theories and three major conceptual changes will be                       investigated.  The historical transitions she will be examining                 as case studies for her project are the move from medieval to                   Newtonian theories of motion, the subsequent move from Newtonian                theories of motion to the special and general theories of                       relativity, and the move from Newtonian mechanics to quantum                    mechanics.  Her analysis should deepen our understanding of how                 conceptual structures emerge and are adopted by scientific                      communities, and should also open up new areas of investigation                 in the cognitive sciences.",
