 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposed project is to develop a methodology for            designing efficient parallel and distributed algorithms for very                large-scale engineering computational problems.  A novel systematic             algorithm design methodology based on the concept of hierarchy,                 aggregation, and disaggregation (HAD) will be developed.  These three           concepts are integrated with the popular techniques of divide-and-              conquer, recursion and iteration to form a systematic approach to               parallel and distributed algorithm design.                                                                                                                      To demonstrate the power of this general methodology and to root the            methodology is some specific engineering fields, engineering                    computational problems used as test cacaos.  Three parts of this                project include:  The General Methodology Study, The Large Scale                Problems in Data Networks, and Dynamic Programming Problems.                    Implementations and simulations for all the algorithms developed in             the tasks will also be carried out.",
