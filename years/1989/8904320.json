 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southeastern California preserves a record of 2 billion                    years of tectonic history that occurred along the continental                   margin of the United States.  Previous work on this consortium                  project has provided considerable information about Precambrian                 structural evolution, Mesozoic compression and Cenozoic exten-                  sional events in the Old Woman Mountains.  This renewal will                    build on this information to address Mesozoic orogenic processes                in continental crust, particularly on the typically obscure early               stages of orogeny.  The Mesozoic upper crust in this area was                   first tectonically buried to depths ranging from near zero to                   more than 20 kilometers, then exhumed rapidly at the end of the                 Mesozoic, and subsequently preserved largely intact through the                 mid-Tertiary extension that strongly overprinted adjacent                       regions.  Work will focus on developing prograde thermochrono-                  metry for the region, the thermal and kinematic history of                      ductile shear zones, on refinement of thermobarometry and its                   application to rapidly evolving orogen, the linkage between                     pluton emplacement and tectonism and attempting to characterize                 the lower continental crust through high-pressure xenoliths.                    Results will be integrated in an attempt to discover in some                    detail the interactions of thermal and mechanical processes                     active in continental margin dynamics.",
