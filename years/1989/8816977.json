 "awd_abstract_narration": "Massif anorthosites are plutonic igneous rocks consisting                  almost entirely of plagioclase feldspar.  Recurring problems in                 the study of these enigmatic rocks include the mechanisms that                  lead to such unusual concentrations of plagioclase on the scale                 of batholiths, the nature and source of their parental magmas,                  their relationship to associated iron-titanium oxide ores, their                relationship to associated granitic igneous rocks of the                        admellite-charnockite-mangerite suite, and the crystallization -                differentiation processes that link some or all of these rocks                  together as parts of single or repeated episodes of magmatism.                       The emplacement of massif anorthosites appears restricted in               space and time to relatively narrow belts of mid-Proterozoic age.               Accordingly, the formation of massif anorthosites and their                     associated rocks represents an important stage in the growth and                development of the continental crust spanning only a short                      interval of Earth history.                                                           We will investigate the origin of massif anorthosite and                   associated rock types through an integrated field, petrological                 and geochemical study on the St. Urbain and Labrieville                         anorthosites, Quebec.  Our study of St. Urbain is a continuation                of work begun a number of years ago, whereas the study of                       Labrieville represents a new initiative.  Each massif contains a                range of rock types pertinent to a critical evaluation of the                   anorthosite problem within plutons that are small enough to be                  investigated in great detail.                                                        Our work will include the analysis of mineral compositions                 by electron microprobe methods, and the analysis of whole-rocks                 for major and selected trace elements by a combination of X-ray                 fluorescence (XRF) and instrumental neutron activation (INA)                    methods.  We will establish a comprehensive petrological and                    geochemical data base that will allow us to develop quantitative                models for the chemical assembly of the anorthositic rocks, to                  evaluate processes responsible for their magmatic                               differentiation, and to provide well-constrained estimates of                   their parental magma compositions.",
