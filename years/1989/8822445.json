 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor T. Darrah Thomas of Oregon State                  University and Dr. Michele R. Siggel of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory            for research collaboration with Professor Leif J. Saethre of the                Department of Chemistry of the University of Tromso, Norway.  They              share an interest in understanding the factors that affect the                  ability of a molecule to accept charge.  They are studying the                  relationships between core-ionization energies, proton affinities,              and the rates and orientations of additions reactions.  They will also          investigate substituent effects in thiopenes and the charge distri-             bution in nonplanar amides.  Their research uses experimental                   measurements of core-ionization energies and Augur kinetic energies,            comparison of these energies with each other and with gas-phase                 acidities, and ab initio electronic structure calculations.  The                experimental facilities for the research, including primarily an                electron spectrometer, are at Oregon State University.  Some of the             theoretical work is done at all three locations, but the main focus             of theoretical capabilities and facilities is the University of                 Tromso.  It has a well developed set of theoretical programs,                   computers for efficiently exploiting them, and a core of theoretical            chemists to help in developing further insights into these problems.                                                                                            Many important chemical processes depend on the ability of a molecule           to accept charge.  This ability is affected by two factors: the                 charge distribution in the neutral molecule and the ability of                  valence electrons to rearrange after the charge is added.  This                 research investigates the deficiencies of simple models that have               long been used to understand these effects.  It should produce a                better understanding of the electronic structure of small molecules             and of the factors that affect the ability of molecules to accept               charge.",
