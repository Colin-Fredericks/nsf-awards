 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many fundamental problems remain for the stable isotopic                   analysis of tree rings.  Although the analyses have great                       potential for paleoclimatic reconstructions, separating the                     various potential causes of isotopic change has been very                       difficult.  Stable-carbon isotopic compositions of tree rings may               be affected by many parameters, including temperature changes,                  growth rate, moisture availability.  The PI proposes to separate                these various effects by conducting a series of controlled-growth               experiments and by analyzing field samples at sites where                       meteorological parameters are continuously monitored.  This                     research is important because it will provide the fundamental                   relationships between climatic variables and tree-ring carbon                   isotopic composition, and it will help to develop this                          methodology into a new calibrated tool for paleoclimate                         reconstructions.  This proposal has been considered under the                   Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.",
