 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project BURDS introduces event based distributed data replication               as a practical method for including redundacy in distributed                    systems.  Data redundacy helps improve the availability of data                 under failures, and may also enhance the response time of data                  access by substituting local accesses for remote ones.                          Traditionally, data is replicated by copying a data object's                    state, or value.  BURDS explores use of partially replicating                   state transition (or event) histories instead, in an attempt to                 show that they are more suitable for representing abstract data                 types in distributed computing environments.  In addition BURDS,                research intends to develop an experimental technique that                      ensures that results of performance comparisons between different               replication methods are repeatable and analyzable.  The                         complexity, the deep layering, and the non determinism of the                   environment of a distributed system render these goals                          particularly hard to achieve.  However, recently available tools                acquired for BURDS have explicit support for these goals.                       Finally, the implementation activity of BURDS should contribute                 to theoretical investigations into problems that are illuminated                by BURDS.  Two examples of these are:  (1) modeling the potential               information flow patterns in networks that may fail by                          partitioning, and (2) transforming an event history into a value.",
