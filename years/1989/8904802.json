 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a program of far-infrared (FIR)                         magnetospectroscopic studies of compound semiconductors, with                   strong emphasis on layered structures of II-VI compounds and                    their ternary alloys, including diluted magnetic semiconductors                 (DMS).  There will be four areas of investigations.  First, they                will employ FIR magnetooptical techniques to study impurity                     levels of doped epilayers of wide gap II-VI semiconductor                       compounds and their ternary alloys prepared by molecular beam                   epitaxy (MBE) and by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE).  The focus will                be on hydrogenic donor levels, whose characteristic energies (1s                - 2p transition, ionization energy, spin splitting in DMS alloys,               etc.) correspond to the FIR energy range.  Second, they propose                 to apply these same techniques to the study of impurities in                    doped II-VI based superlattices and quantum wells, where the                    impurity levels depend on the quantum well geometry and on                      impurity distribution.  Third, they will use FIR                                magnetospectroscopy to study quantum wells, superlattices, and                  interfaces involving narrow gap semiconductors.  Fourth, they                   will investigate antiferromagnetic resonance in manganese based                 diluted magnetic semiconductors, where such studies can provide                 definitive information on dynamical spin processes.  One of the                 strengths of the proposed program is that many of the layered                   structures to be investigated - as well as bulk samples - can be                prepared in their own materials preparation laboratory, either by               MBE or (in the case of samples for the antiferromagnetic                        resonance studies) by conventional crystal growth techniques.",
