 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for equipment to establish a                      microinjection facility at Union College, specifically to                       introduce substances such s Lucifer Yellow and fluorescent                      dextrans by iontophoresis  and direct pressure injection into                   opaque, penetration-sensitive embryos.  The facility will be used               for demonstration of a modern experimental technique in the                     undergraduate embryology course and by students doing individual                research projects under faculty supervision.  The instruments to                be purchased included an Olympus stereo-dissecting microscope                   with photographic attachments, a helium-cadmium laser,                          micromanipulators, an intracellular amplifier and a vibration                   isolation table.  This facility will significantly upgrade the                  offerings in developmental biology, which have historically been                classical, by incorporating a new technique into the embryology                 course and increasing the sophistication of the equipment                       available to the research students in animal development.  The                  grantee institution is matching this NSF award with funds from                  non-Federal sources.",
