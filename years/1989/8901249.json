 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is for the study of new methods                           for producing  plasma and for diagnosing them. There is                         a common need to develop suitable plasmas for many                              new applications.  For instance, the plasma beat-wave                           field accelerator and the plasma lens for final focus of                        high energy beams need small but dense, uniform,                                quiescent, and reproducible plasmas.  Plasma processing                         requires dc plasma sources whose composition,                                   temperature, and potential can be controlled.  Initially,                       this work will explore the limits of rf helicon wave                            sources with a view towards using them in plasma                                accelerator research and in plasma-assisted materials                           processing.  Research on helicon waves has already begun                        on both theory and experiment.  At the same time, work                          will begin on new probe techniques for measuring plasma                         properties in the presence of strong radio frequency                            oscillations.  The project will then extend to other                            possible methods of ionization, such as two-photon                              ionization of Xe using uv flashlamps, or laser-heated                           capillary discharges, or associative ionization of Na.  All                     these methods are non-standard and need study before                            one can map out their possibilities.",
