Coughlin, University of Connecticut and Drs. A. Halim M.M.                   El-Sayed and Wafaa M. Mahmoud of Zagazig University, Zagazig,                   Egypt.  Each Egyptian scientist is a holder of a Peace Fellowship,              which will enable them to spend about five months at the University             of Connecticut working with the Dr. Coughlin.  Project funding will             allow (1) an extension of their stay, if appropriated for the                   progress of their research, (2) permit them to return to Egypt to               work and then to return to Connecticut a second time to continue                project work and (3) enable the P.I. to visit Zagazig University to             work with them a third period.  The collaboration is using                      immobilized microbial cells for producing dextran, a blood plasma               expander, and ephedrine, a widely used therapeutic drug.  New                   immobilization method, new immobilization carriers and new                      production technologies are being investigated.  Dr El-Sayed is                 working on production of dextran from sucrose, while Dr. Mahmoud                will work on production of the therapeutic drug, L-ephedrine.  The              proposed research efforts of the two Egyptian scientists will                   introduce technology for the production of two important drugs into             Egypt and could lead to the development of their production in that             country to benefit the Egyptian population that might not otherwise             have access to these efficacious drugs.                                                                                                                         Scope:  This proposal will bring together scientific research                   scientists from the universities of two countries working in the                area of microbial transformations and immobilization of enzymes and             cells.  The development of scientific skills and research methods               will be translated from the U.S. to Egypt, first to Zagazig                     University and if successful, then to local Egyptian production of              two important drugs, one a plasma expander and the second, a                    therapeutic.  This research will require the development of new                 general knowledge and procedures for immobilizing cells and                     designing biocatalysts and associated bioreactors.  This proposal               fulfills objectives of the Science in Developing Countries Program              in its exchange and transfer of scientific knowledge through a                  international collaboration.",
