 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growing awareness of the magnitude and character of environmental          change on a global scale has led to increasing concern about how                individuals and institutions will respond to such changes and develop           collective responses that reduce or eliminate harmful human actions or          that alleviate the detrimental impacts of such changes.  This project           will initiate a long-term research program to evaluate the processes by         which societies collectively learn about global environmental risks.            Following analysis of previous studies of the ways in which societies           have learned about these types of risks, the investigator will identify         obstacles that impeded the learning process and will propose                    organizational and managerial initiatives that might reduce those               obstacles.  The latter objectives will be undertaken through                    comparative case studies of the roles of six critical sets of actors            (scientists, governments, international governmental organizations,             nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and the media) in social             learning about three specific environmental risks (climate change,              ozone depletion, and acid-oxidant pollution) in seven nations (U.S.A.,          U.S.S.R., United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden, the              Netherlands, and India).  This initial project will focus on                    development of the general theory and refinement of case-study analytic         procedures in the U.S.A. and Germany.                                                This proposal will expand general understandings of the ways in            which human institutions respond to global environmental change in a            number of critical ways.  It will expand general theory regarding the           ways in which organizations learn and respond to large-scale problems,          and it will provide specific demonstrations of the ways in which                investigative approaches used in ecology, economics, sociology, and             geography can be integrated.  While providing specific insights about           this problem in the U.S. and Germany, the project also will lay a               sounder foundation for more elaborate projects dealing with more                nations and a broader range of issues, thereby enhancing prospects for          future research both by this investigator and by others.",
