 "awd_abstract_narration": "For ages older than mid-Mesozoic, apparent polar wander                    (APW) paths of the major continents become the most important                   single source of information about lithospheric plate motions.                  The validity of these APW paths and the degree to which they can                be interpreted in terms of path geotectonic motions is ultimately               dependent upon the quality of he paleomagnetic poles on which                   they are based.  Recent studies have indicated that the Mesozoic                North American APW path can be well modeled by paleomagnetic                    Euler pole (PEP) analysis in which the APW path is viewed as                    sequence of small circle tracks separated by corners or \"cusps\"                 in the path.  The \"J1 cusp\" occurs in the Late Triassic to Early                Jurassic and is related to changing North American plate motion                 associated with the breakup of Pangea.  However, because of                     inadequacies in the paleomagnetic pole data base, the J1 cusp is                certainly not as clearly defined as it could be with acquisition                of high-quality paleomagnetic data.  Recent results from the                    Moenave Formation clearly demonstrate that careful paleomagnetic                studies can produce very well defined poles from the Late                       Triassic-Early Jurassic strata of northeastern Arizona.  Further                paleomagnetic studies of the Chinle, Kayenta, and to her                        formations will be performed in this project in order to more                   clearly define the pattern of North American APW during this                    critical time interval.  Results will (1) greatly improve                       knowledge of Late Triassic and Early Jurassic APW for North                     American and (2) provide a major test for applicability of PEP                  models, with attendant global geodynamic implications.",
