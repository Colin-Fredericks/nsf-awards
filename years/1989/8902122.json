Mathematical formulation of                     such problems often require the determination of one or more                    coefficient functions in a partial differential equation (or                    system of equations), given as data certain limited knowledge                   about special solutions to the equation.  One finds two                         substantial sources of difficulty associated with most problems                 of this type, in theory and in application, namely nonlinearity                 and ill-posedness.  There is a need for much more mathematical                  analysis.                                                                            The objective of this project is the investigation of the                  mathematical structure of certain model problems arising in                     several areas of inverse scattering.  As a general rule the                     approach to a particular nonlinear problem will be via the                      study of linearized approximations.  Such linearized inverse                    problems are also of independent interest.  Specific questions                  under investigation include the uniqueness of the solution, the                 continuous dependence of the solution on the given data, the                    extent of validity of linearization techniques, and how the                     answers to the previous questions can be used in the design of                  numerical solution methods.",
