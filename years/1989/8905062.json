 "awd_abstract_narration": "The native three-dimensional structure of cauliflower mosaic                    virus (CaMV) will be studied using recently developed                           cryo-electron microscopy and image analysis techniques.  CaMV is                one of the most extensively studied plant viruses, in part,                     because it was the first plant virus in which a double-stranded                 DNA genome was discovered.  However, little is known about the                  details of the organization and assembly of the DNA and protein                 components.  The resulting structural model will provide new                    insights about the symmetry and packing arrangement of the                      protein subunits in the capsid and may reveal new details                       concerning protein-DNA interactions within the structure.                                                                                                       CaMV is the type member of the caulimovirus family, the only                    group of plant viruses known to encapsidate a genome of                         double-stranded DNA.  Caulimoviruses are unique among small DNA                 viruses of eukaryotes in being assembled in the cytoplasm rather                than the nucleus of their host cells.  They serve as a suitable                 model system for studying plant gene organization, expression and               replication and they also are potentially useful as gene vectors                for the genetic manipulation of higher plants.  In addition,                    there are striking similarities between CaMV and certain animal                 viruses.  For example, CaMV and the retroviruses both replicate                 by reverse transcription and this represents the first such                     example of this phenomenon in plant cells.  To fully understand                 how CaMV functions, detailed knowledge of its structure is                      essential.",
