 "awd_abstract_narration": "While methods to estimate system reliability are being studied                  extensively, the practical inclusion of system reliability at the               design level has received comparatively little attention.  In                   designing a structure, the ultimate concern is system reliability               rather than individual component reliabilities.  However,                       existing Reliability-Based Design methods are component-based.                                                                                                  The objective of this project is to develop a model system-                     reliability-based-LRFD method.  Since the proposers have a wide                 experience with transmission structures, this model LRFD method                 will apply to the design of electric transmission structures.                                                                                                   The project will be conducted in two phases.  The first phase                   will develop a computer program that designers and utilities can                use to incorporate system reliability in the design of                          transmission structures.  The second phase will use the computer                program from phase one to extend the investigators component-                   based RBD method for transmission structures to include system                  reliability capability.                                                                                                                                         This project is seeking 50% co-sponsorship from NSF.  The U.S.                  power industry, represented by the Electric Power Research                      Institute, has committed to obtain the other 50% of the funds                   required for this project.",
