 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to explore the applicability of the new method               of surface-induced dissociation (SID) to biological problems.  In               this experiment, biological compounds will be ionized by one of                 the newer desorption ionization methods and the ionized compound                of interest selected in the first stage of a tandem mass                        spectrometer.  Collisions with a solid surface will then be used                to dissociate the selected biological compound and its structure                will be deduced by recording an SID daughter spectrum by scanning               the second analyzer.  The advantages of this approach over                      conventional tandem mass spectrometry will be evaluated by                      acquiring a triple quadrupole instrument which incorporates                     capabilities for ion/surface as well as gas phase collisions.                   The new instrument will replace a triple quadrupole in the PI's                 laboratory, providing a mass range (4000 vs. 1000 daltons) better               suited to the study of biological compounds.  In evaluating the                 capabilities of SID, emphasis will be placed on peptide                         sequencing.  A wide variety of other biologically important                     problems will also be addressed including the analysis of DNA                   adducts with carcinogenic hydrocarbons, structures of cell wall                 oligosaccharides, as well as monitoring products generated in                   bioreactors.  In addition to the use of SID for biological                      compounds, ion/molecule reactions which are selective for                       particular functional groups will be explored.  The capabilities                of the new instrument will be made available to Purdue scientists               who have particularly significant problems.  Utilization will be                coordinated through the Campus-wide Mass Spectrometry Facility,                 and interdisciplinary facility which coordinates access to and                  utilization of mass spectrometers on campus.",
