 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) of animal and plant                   extracellular matrices perform a variety of structural, developmental           and homeostatic functions.  While much is known about HRGP organization         and structure, information on HRGP interactions, and their roles in             establishment of matrix architecture is fragmentary.  The alga                  Chlamydomonas is uniquely suited for analysis of this important                 problem: (1) Its cell wall is constructed entirely from HRGPs; (2) its          outer wall can be selectively extracted and assembled in vitro; and (3)         Chlamydomonas is an excellent genetic system.  HRGP interactions will be        studied by quantitative in vitro assembly, and molecular cloning of two         HRGP genes (GP3A;GP3B).  cDNAs encoding GP3A and GP3B will be isolated          from an existing Chlamydomonas lambda-gt11 library, analyzed for                evidence of sequence homologles with each other and previously cloned           outer wall HRGPs (GP1 and GP2), and examined for evidence of conserved          repeats.  In addition, expression of GP3A/B genes during cell wall              regeneration will be studied to determine whether genes for outer wall          HRGPs are coordinately regulated.  Candidate functional domains will be         examined by inhibition of in vitro assembly, using HRGP peptides and            anti-HRGP monoclonal antibodies, and mapped by immunotopography.  In            addition, genomic GP3A/B sequences will isolated from a Chlamydomonas           Charon 30 library, and employed for gene structure analysis.  If GP3A/B         genes prove to be coordinately regulated with outer wall HRGPs, 5'              untranslated regions of genomic clones will be examined for evidence of         conserved (potential regulatory) sequences.                                                                                                                     The results of these studies will be of great interest to at least three        groups of bioscientists:  (1), those interested in the use of                   Chlamydomonas as a model organism for a variety of cell biological              problems; (2), those interested in mechanisms of plant cell wall                assembly during growth and development in higher plants, including crop         plants, and (3), those interested in general biochemical principles of          structure-function relationships involved in protein-protein                    interactions.",
