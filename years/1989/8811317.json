 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this study is to better understand the physiological and         biochemical mechanisms used by insects to survive the winter.  The              flesh fly, Sarcophaga crassipalpis, will be used as the insect model            for this project.  Experimentation will focus on the relationship               between diapause, a state of winter dormancy, and mechanisms of insect          cold-hardening.  Particular attention will be paid to the role of the           neuroendocrine system in the regulation of increased cold tolerance.            Cryomicroscopy will be used to define the nature of cellular injury due         to low temperature exposure and the role of the cryoprotectant glycerol         in preventing this type of injury.  The relationship between the heat           shock and the rapid cold-hardening response will be evaluated.                                                                                                  Although this study is designed to increase our basic understanding of          low temperature survival, the information gained from this research may         provide leads for the future development of new approaches to the               control of agricultural pests.  For example, if it were possible to             prevent or block the cold-hardening process in insect pests, these              species would be unable to survive exposure to low temperatures during          the winter season.",
