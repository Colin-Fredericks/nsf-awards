 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in                   structuring the littoral zone community in northern Wisconsin                   lakes will be evaluated.  The proposed work builds on 5 years of                collaborative research examining the major forces controlling the               structure and function of the nearshore community.  The approach                is comprehensive.  It evaluates complex interactions, direct and                indirect interactions among predators and their prey, and the                   cascade hypothesis.  They have all been recently applied to the                 pelagia of lakes, but are largely untested in the structurally-                 complex environment of the benthic, littoral cummunity.  The                    centerpiece for this effort is a mesocosm experiment in which                   densities of fish predators of crayfish and crayfish are                        treatment variables.  Treatments in which the fish predators of                 crayfish are reduced to mimic the impact of winterkill on the top               trophic level will be used.  The mesocosms represent a scale                    intermediate between laboratory and whole-lake experiments.  The                approach is tractable, realistic, and absolutely required to make               progress toward understanding those forces structuring the                      littoral community.",
