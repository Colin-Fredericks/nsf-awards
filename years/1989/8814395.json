 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal on \"Joint Observations of the Long Term Evolution of              Solar Magnetic Fields\" between Dr. Harold Zirin and Dr. Ken G.                  Libbrecht of California Institute of Technology and Professors Ai               Guoxiang, Han Feng, and Liu Jianqiang of the Beijing Astronomical               Observatory, is jointly sponsored by NSF and by the Chinese Academy             of Sciences.                                                                                                                                                    At all times the sun is covered with weak magnetic fields arranged              in the form of a network of elements 30 km across, thought to be                generated by a large scale convective pattern.  Attempts to measure             the lifetime of the magnetic network have indicated that the                    elements last about 50 hours.  What replaces them when they die out             is not obvious.  Unfortunately, studies from short daily runs                   provide good data for only 10 out of 24 hours, and do not show what             the source of these moving elements might be.                                                                                                                   The investigators believe the only solution for this problem is to              obtain continuous observations of these magnetic fields.  At                    present, only the videomagnetographs of the Big Bear Solar                      Observatory and the Huairou Solar Observatory can perform this                  task.  The program will use the combined capability of the two sites            to cover 16 of 24 hours per day to follow the development and motion            of the  fields.  By supplementing this with data from a patrol                  telescope in Tel Aviv, the investigators shall be able to follow the            evolution of the small magnetic fields for several 24 hour periods              and determine exactly how they evolve, thus achieving a new                     understanding of the magnetic features which underlie solar                     prominences.",
