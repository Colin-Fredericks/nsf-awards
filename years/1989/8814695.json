 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective is to develop practical procedures whereby                        characterization of limit state consequences can be incorporated                into an analysis for reliability-constrained structural system                  optimization.  Multiobjective mathematical programming will be                  used to identify the limit state surface for multiple,                          independently varying loads.  The identification of consequence                 for each region of the limit surface, rather than simply the                    traditional \"failure\" or \"success,\" will permit the                             performance/reliability tradeoff to be studied.  For a ductile                  frame with randomness in both loads and moment capacities, a                    linear program efficiently produces failure mode                                characteristics.  For this case, it is possible to associate                    discrete load space regions with individual failure modes, and to               assess the extent of structural distress for each mode.                         Efficient methods of combining Monte Carlo directional simulation               with mathematical programming, and especially linear programming,               will be utilized to permit a comprehensive assessment of                        structural system reliability.  The procedures developed in this                project will permit improved safety and economy of structures by                considering design of the structural system as an entire entity.                Powerful mathematical techniques now accessible to structural                   engineers can be used to optimize the structure as a whole,                     taking into account the reliability of performance and limit                    state consequences.",
