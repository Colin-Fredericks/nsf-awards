 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research will study how Islamic people living                 in the Southern Philippines use the concepts and values of their                Islamic heritage to deal with each other on a daily basis.  The                 student will live in a village for a year and observe Islamic                   court cases as well as daily activities.  Methods include                       participant observation, structured interviewing, and the                       analysis of public documents such as court proceedings.                                                                                                         This research is important because Islam is a powerful force in                 many areas of the world that are important to U.S. interests.                   Frequently the actions of Islamic peoples seem incomprehensible                 to Westerners; therefore we need studies such as the present one                to explain the role of Islamic beliefs in influencing daily                     behavior and conflict resolution.",
