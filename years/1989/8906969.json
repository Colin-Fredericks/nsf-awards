 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work of Kevin Burgess is supported by the Synthetic Organic                 Chemistry Program.  Burgess, an assistant professor of                          chemistry at Rice University, is studying the catalysis of                      hydroboration reactions by rhodium catalysts.  The                              non-catalyzed hydroboration reaction has had a major impact on                  oprganic synthesis; the catalyzed process will make the next                    major improvement in the utility of the chemistry.  Burgess                     will utilize chiral rhodium complexes to install chirality into                 the hydroboration process.  Mechanistic studies, as well as                     general examination of the scope and limitation of the                          developing technology, will be a major emphasis of this new                     program.                                                                                                                                                        This proposal outlines plans to develop rhodium-catalyzed                       hydroboration reactions for routine use in preparative organic                  chemistry.  Asymmetric hydroborations mediated by various                       homochiral rhodium-phosphine complexes will be examined for                     substrates which include unfunctionalized and functionalized                    prochiral alkenes and a range of chiral allylic/homoallylic                     compounds.  Mechanistic studies performed in parallel with                      these general synthetic probes will be used to identify ways to                 better understand the basic  chemistry involved as well as to                   find methods for changing and improving the technology.",
