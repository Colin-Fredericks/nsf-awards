 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of a patch is widely used in ecology, but                      patches are often viewed in a simplistic way.  The internal                     structure of patches and the mosaic surrounding patches are                     influenced by patchiness at smaller and larger scales.  Thus,                   environments may be viewed more realistically as mosaics formed                 by a nested hierarchy of patches.  This hierarchical concept of                 patchiness may be examined by studying nectarivorous birds,                     because nectar resources are often distributed in a hierarchical                fashion.  How both patch structure and context in natural and                   experimental hierarchies of patches influence the foraging                      behavior of broad-tailed hummingbirds (Selasphorus platycercus)                 will be investigated.  The hierarchical structure of patchiness                 in the natural distribution of nectar resources will be measured.                    The experimental hierarchy consists of three levels of                     heterogeneity: (1) within inflorescences (2) within patches, and                (3) between patches.  The influence of hierarchical resource-                   mosaics on foraging behavior could influence population-level                   processes such as pollination and territorial behavior.  Thus,                  the proposed study will increase the understanding of the                       ecological consequences of landscape heterogeneity.",
