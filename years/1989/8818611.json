 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conscious suppression of a thought is a difficult thing to                  do.  Just trying for a few minutes not to think of white bear,                  for example, can be perplexing.  But people seem intent on                      trying to suppress unwanted thoughts nonetheless.  Thoughts of                  frightening events or depressing losses are targets of                          suppression, and people also may suppress thoughts of food,                     alcohol, or other temptations they hope to avoid.  This                         research explores thought suppression by asking people to                       suppress thoughts under various laboratory conditions.  Prior                   studies have shown that when people try to do this, they                        usually are capable of avoiding the target thought after a                      while by distracting themselves with other things.  The studies                 in the project address two fundamental questions about this                     process.  How does self.distraction operate, and what                           consequences can thought suppression be expected to have?  The                  studies of how self.distraction operates examine how people                     suppress thoughts most effectively, and thus these studies have                 implications for the treatment of alcohol and substance                         addiction.  The studies of the consequences of thought                          suppression focus on the possibility that suppressed thoughts                   may influence a person's thinking, emotions, and social                         interactions..even though the thoughts are seemingly absent.                    Thought suppression may make an unwanted thought more easily                    brought to mind, may make exciting thoughts unusually likely to                 produce physiological agitation and anxiousness, and may                        promote such preoccupation with the unwanted thought that                       people find they cannot steer their social interactions in the                  directions they wish them to go.  Taken together, these studies                 will introduce new knowledge on whether and when people should                  use thought suppression, and the consequences..both agreeable                   and harmful.that can be expected as a result.",
