 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pacific Science Center will design, circulate, and evaluate a major         travelling science outreach exhibition and accompanying program, Science        Carnival, designed to reach rural populations not easily served by urban        science museums.  A 3,000 square foot exhibition on basic science topics        combined with public demonstration programs and teacher training                activities in science will travel to 15 sites throughout Washington,            Idaho, and Montana during a three year period, reaching more than               500,000 people with limited access to science museums and to modern             science education methods.                                                                                                                                      The traveling museum will be designed to work within communities as             small as 10,000 population, and will fit into many different facilities,        ranging from schools to county fairs and exposition centers.  A special         effort will be made to insure the participation of Native American,             Hispanic, and Black minority families from the communities the exhibit          will reach.  The majority of operating expenses will be covered by              earned income, insuring the long term viability of the program.                                                                                                 A variety of evaluation activities will monitor the success of the              project and determine both marketing opportunities and educational              impacts of the visit to each community.  Following its successful               demonstration, the Pacific Science Center will share essential planning         information with science museums nationwide and hold a dissemination            conference for interested museum staff.  Overall, more than $2.0 million        in local support and earned income will be added to this NSF award.//",
