 "awd_abstract_narration": "Associated with the Texas male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-T) of                     maize are the traits, cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) and                      susceptibility to two leaf diseases.  The mitochondrial                         genome of cms-T maize contains a unique gene, urf13-T, that                     encodes a 13 kDa protein which has been implicated with cms                     and disease susceptibility.  Helminthosporium maydis, race T,                   a fungal pathogen produces a pathotoxin that is responsible                     for its virulence toward cms-T maize.  cms-T mitochondria are                   specifically sensitive to the pathotoxin, and the basis for                     the sensitivity is a 13 kDa protein encoded by the                              mitochondrial gene, urf13-T.  We propose to study the                           mechanism by which the 13 kDa protein confers toxin                             sensitivity to mitochondria.  Mutational analysis will be                       used to characterize the properties of the 13 kDa protein                       that are important in conferring toxin sensitivity.  Toxin                      binding, toxin protection experiments and the effect of the                     toxin-protein interaction on membranes will be studied.                         Previous studies have indicated that cms may be caused by                       mitochondrial dysfunction.  We propose to investigate the                       relationship between cms and mitochondrial function by                          microscopy, mitochondrial protein expression and                                potentiometric dyes.  Transformation experiments and other                      approaches will be used to evaluate the role of the urf13-T                     gene in cms.  An interesting sequence, ORF25, will also be                      studied to determine its function and role in cms.                                                                                                              The inability to separate the two tracts of disease                             susceptibility and male sterility has led to the possible                       belief that both phenotypes could be caused by the same                         mitochondrial gene.  These experiments should enhance our                       understanding of the linkage of the two traits, an                              understanding which has both basic and economic                                 ramifications.",
