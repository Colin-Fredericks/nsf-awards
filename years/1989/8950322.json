 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a three-year project to be conducted by         the Physics Education Group in the Physics Department at the University         of Washington.  The project consists of three interrelated components:          1) an investigation of student understanding of key concepts in                 classical and modern physics, 2) the application of research results to         the development of instructional materials for precollege teachers, and         3) an inservice teacher education program for testing instructional             materials and for preparing teachers to teach physics and physical              science.  A version appropriate for elementary and middle school                teachers will also be developed.  The inservice program is closely              coordinated with a preservice program supported by the university.  The         project will be guided by a national advisory group with expertise              salient to the comprehensive nature of the work to be accomplished.                                                                                             The emphasis in the research component will be on topics from classical         physics necessary for understanding modern physics, such as relative            motion and frames of references, waves and physical optics, and                 electricity and magnetism.  These investigators also plan to examine            conceptual understanding in selected topics from twentieth century              physics, especially those that demonstrate the inadequacy of classical          ideas.  The investigation will focus on precollege teachers and will            also include students from the various introductory courses offered by          the Physics Department.  Results from this research will be used to             guide the development of instructional materials for strengthening the          preparation of precollege teachers.  The materials will be in the form          of printed instructional modules, interactive computer programs, and            accompanying instructor's guides for university faculty conducting              preservice and inservice courses.  Design, testing, and revision will           take place in the context of the teacher education program conducted by         Physics Education group.  As in previous projects, the development              process will include pilot-testing at other institutions.                                                                                                       Joint support is being provided by the Division of Teacher Preparation          and Enhancement and the Division of Materials Development, Research and         Informal Science Education.",
