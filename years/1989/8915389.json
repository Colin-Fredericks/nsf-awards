 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a planning grant for an Industry/University               Cooperative Research Center for Nanostructual Materials Research.                    The Center plans to perform fundamental research in the                    characterization of a wide variety of materials at the atomic                   level.  The materials that will be investigated are metallic,                   ceramic, polymer, semiconductor and biological tissue.  The                     nanostructure of ferrous and non-ferrous alloys have an impact                  on physical and chemical material properties such as tensile                    strength, creep resistance, corrosion resistance and fatigue                    life.  In semiconductors trace the impurities have a significant                impact on the electrical characteristics and a clearer                          understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of impurity origin                 and transport could have a significant effect on device yield.                       Characteristics of the kinds to be studied will be also have               a significant impact on their utilization in industry.                               The Program Manager recommends a grant in the amount of                    $10,000 for six months to plan an Industry/University Cooperative               Center for Nanostructural Materials Research.",
