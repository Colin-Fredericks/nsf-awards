 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alaska Rasmuson Library proposes to substantially             increase researchers' access to arctic and polar based bibliographic            sources through networking of existing library holdings in a number of          major institutions (University of Colorado, Ohio State University,              Dartmouth College, Alaska University system, the Western Library                Network, and the Research Libraries Information Network).                       Bibliographic records will be merged and made available semi-annually           on a compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM).  Comparison of in-house            on-line holdings of four specialized research libraries will be                 conducted and unique records added to the common base.  An important            separate file, \"A Union List of Polar Serials,\" will be                         completed and added.  These activities and results will be exchanged            with other specialized arctic and polar international centers and will          at the same time greatly increase availability of social science                literature.  Results of this project will be responsive to repeated             recommendations and findings of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of           1984, the Arctic Research Commission, several reports of the National           Academy of Sciences, and will complement environmental data activities          of the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee and bipolar                 information retrieval and dissemination..",
