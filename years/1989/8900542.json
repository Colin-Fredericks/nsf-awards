 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish a Research Experiences for                            Undergraduates Site in the Department of Sociology at the                       University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  The program is designed to                     provide undergraduate sociology majors attending academic                       institutions in the Northern Great Plains region with a ten-week                research experience in sociology.  The primary objective of the                 program is to provide a high-quality research experience to                     students who have limited access to research facilities and                     training at the schools they are attending and to minority                      students (racial, ethnic, women, and the physically disabled).                  Using the facilities of the Bureau of Sociological Research and                 under the guidance of faculty directors, students will initiate                 and carry out research projects from formulating the problem to                 writing a final report.  Students will participate in morning                   seminars where they will learn research methods and share their                 ongoing experiences with each other.  Under the supervision of                  faculty members and a Graduate Research Assistant, afternoons                   will be spent engaging in individual projects  and learning to                  use appropriate research technologies.                                                                                                                          A recruiting plan that takes advantages of an existing statewide                network of sociologists at Nebraska colleges, and which will be                 expanded to included the entire Northern Great Plains region,                   will be used to locate and recruit qualified students to ensure                 success of the REU summer program.",
