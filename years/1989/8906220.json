 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the ubiquity of insect-borne plant diseases in both                natural and agricultural systems, relatively little is known                    about the interactions among plant pathogens, insect vectors, and               susceptible plants in the field.  The long-term goal of the                     proposed research is to understand how disease dynamics of the                  barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) depend on the biological                       interactions between BYDV isolates, aphid vectors, and host                     plants.  Thirty years of data on the fluctuation in relative                    abundance of the five characterized isolates of BYDV in Ithaca,                 NY have documented the displacement of a vector specific isolate                (MAV) by an isolate transmitted nonspecifically by several aphid                vectors (PAV).  The objective of this project is to evaluate the                potential role of vector dispersal in driving the dynamics of the               displacement.  The research will consist of field and laboratory                experiments designed to address the following questions: (1) How                does disease severity induced by the major BYDV isolates affect a               plant's attractiveness to aphids? (2) Does plant infection by the               various BYDV isolates differentially affect the alate production,               fecundity, and survivorship of the two major aphid vectors                      Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi? (3) Does plant infection                by different isolates influence aphid dispersal behavior in the                 field? and (4) Do differences in aphid colonization and dispersal               translate into significant effects on isolate spread?  This                     research has implications for the evolution of virus-vector-host                plant associations and will contribute vital information on the                 potential for spread of novel viral isolates and the evaluation                 of the environmental risks of genetically engineered                            microorganisms.",
