 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Northwestern                       University supports interactive, interdisciplinary research in                  four primary thrust areas investigating the sciences of new                     materials.  The thrust on internal interfaces in nanostructured                 materials addresses the growth of heteroepitaxial thin-film                     structures, the electronic and optical properties of narrow-band                semiconductor superlattices, and the superconducting and                        mechanical properties of superlattices involving metallic                       compounds and interleaved insulators.  The research program on                  high temperature superconducting materials begun in 1987 brings                 together faculty from physics, chemistry, materials science and                 electrical engineering in a collaborative investigation of the                  theory, crystal chemistry, processing and characterization of                   ceramic superconductors.  The electrical transport in molecular                 materials group is engaged in the design and synthesis of new                   solid materials whose optical, magnetic and charge transport                    properties test and extend basic understanding of the organic                   conductive state.  Its work focusses on two classes of molecular                charge-transport materials: polymer solid electrolytes, and                     metallomacrocyclic \"metals\" and conductive polymers.  The                       nonlinear optical polymers thrust begun in 1986 is now called                   macromolecular and molecular nonlinear optical materials.                       Research in this group includes the synthesis and processing,                   theory, and characterization of molecular and polymeric nonlinear               optical materials, and microfabrication studies directed towards                their potential application in devices.                                           In addition to these four thrust areas, the MRL supports                      research in sciences of high-strength steel at Northwestern, part               of a broad effort involving about 30 investigators from                         universities, industry and government laboratories led by the                   Northwestern group.  This effort is directed at the scientific                  basis for new steels in two key classes: martensitic alloy steels               for advanced structural applications, and ferrite-based                         microalloyed steels for high-formability sheet.                                   The MRL also supports the development, operation and                          maintenance of major central materials research facilities at                   Northwestern, and provides seed funds for new faculty and for                   high-risk research on materials.  The program currently involves                31 faculty members, 7 postdoctoral associates, 3 scientific and                 technical support staff, 31 graduate students and 8                             undergraduates.  The Northwestern MRL is under the direction of                 Professor Stephen H. Carr.",
