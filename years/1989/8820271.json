 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funded by the Organic Dynamics Program in Chemistry                  provides support for the research of Prof. Gary Schuster at the                 University of Illinois. The general theme of Schuster's                         research is the creation, detection and reaction behaviour of                   high energy-content reactant intermediates. These intermediates                 will be generated photochemically and examined by analysis of                   their chemical and spectroscopic properties.                                                                                                                    In particular, one group of experiments will attempt to                         generate, detect and characterize a set of novel                                boron-containing heterocycles, hypovalent compounds of boron                    and boranyl radicals.  These largely unexplored substances are                  expected to have unusual properties of potential practical and                  theoretical importance.  Other experiments will explore the                     properties of electronically excited complexes of dienes and                    dieneophiles.  These species appear to undergo reactions that                   yield products not easily obtained by conventional routes. As                   time and resources allow, the properties of ylide ions will                     also be examined.  These high-energy-content reactants are                      formed by oxidation of ylides: their properties have never been                 examined experimentally.",
