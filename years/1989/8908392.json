 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intent of this project is to develop a general analytic                     theory of the dynamical motion of axisymmetric rigid bodies                     subject to arbitrary body fixed forces and moments.  The problem                has received some attention in the past by classical dynamicists                and more recently, in a restricted form, by Bodewadt.                           Unfortunately,the general problem has not been solved and may be                unsolvable by current methods.  Furthermore, the Bodewadt                       solution may be in error.  The research focuses on four topics                  including the Euler equations of motion, the Eulerian angles,                   controlling the angular momentum vector, and the translational                  acceleration equations.  Each of these is further subdivided into               sub topics.  For the first, attention is directed toward finding                an analytical solution when the transverse angular rates are not                small, and toward the case of time varying body fixed torques.                  The Eulerian angles analysis attempts to simplify existing                      solutions, and to adjust the solutions to account for time                      varying body fixed torques.  The angular momentum study derives                 solutions for the angular momentum based on solutions for the                   Eulerian angles.  Lastly, the acceleration equations study                      focuses on deriving expressions for velocity and position of the                rigid body.  This research enhances the general knowledge base in               analytical dynamics.  It has applications in the knowledge and                  control of spinning and thrusting bodies such as spacecraft and                 rockets.",
