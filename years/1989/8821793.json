 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solids processing operations are commonly encountered in flowsheets             for petrochemical, polymer, inorganic and biochemical processes.                Specialty polymers and biochemical processes are high growth areas              where new plants design are being developed and efficient methodology           to screen the numerous design alternatives is needed.  Petrochemical            and inorganic processes are more mature but could be more competitive           if retrofitted to reduce raw materials and energy cost.  The purpose            of this work is to develop systematic procedures that can be used for           the conceptual design of plants that include solids processing.                 Processing is commonly done in stages, where more detail and more               accuracy are added to the design at each level in a hierarchial                 manner.  The goal of the first step is to determine if any flowsheet            is profitable, an if so, to find the best three of four flowsheets.                                                                                                                                                                             Conceptual design is the rapid screening of process alternatives                (using shot cut design models) to identify the best process to                  develop.  The PIs plan to divide the work into three components:  1.            The development of a 'system' approach to the synthesis of solids               processes, i.e., equipment selection guidelines,an understanding of             alternative flowsheet structures, the identification of the dominant            design variables, and the sensitivity of the total processing costs to          model parameters                                                                and the functional form of models.                                              2.  The development of new models for solid processing units so                 that there is a consistent description of the process behavior,                 for example, the existing models for crystallizes contain                       descriptions of the particle size distribution, but the models                  for centrifuges, filters and dryers do not.                                     3.  The development of a new testing stragtegy for solids                       processes, so that the minimum information about the                            characteristics of the solid (obtained by a chemist) can be used                to develop a first design. The procedure will help the user to                  select the process equipment, to select the interconnections                    between the units, to identify the dominant design variables, to                estimate the optimum design conditions for the process                          alternatives selected, to list other alternatives that should be                considered, and to identify the best alternative.  An interactive               computer code based on this procedure will be the final product                 of the project.",
