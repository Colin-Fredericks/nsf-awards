 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several faculty at Swarthmore are currently using National                      Science Foundation Supercomputer Centers as essential components                in their research programs, in student projects, and in courses                 teaching computational methods.  In order to achieve faster and                 more reliable access to these advanced facilities, Swarthmore                   proposes to acquire a high speed link (1.5 million bits per                     second) between the college and the PREPnet mid level network                   along with associated communication equipment.  The PREPnet                     system is connected to NSFNET, the national research network's                  backbone network which connects mid level networks to the 6                     Supercomputer Centers supported by NSF.                                                                                                                         This project will also provide access for Haverford and Bryn Mawr               Colleges as soon as their campus networks are integrated with                   Swarthmore's.                                                                                                                                                   Once the connection to PREPnet and consequently to NSFNET is                    established, researchers and faculty using computers can exchange               data with any other NSFNET site with great ease.  The connection                also significantly facilitates data transfer between the                        mainframes at the colleges and it provides remote log.in                        capabilities from Swarthmore College computers to supercomputer                 centers and allows for quick tranfer of results to local                        computers for analysis.                                                                                                                                          //",
