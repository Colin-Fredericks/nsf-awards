 "awd_abstract_narration": "As radiant energy diffuses from a star's interior through its                   surface layers, it interacts with the constituent gases --atoms,                ions, and molecules -- in those surface layers and produces a                   host of absorption and emission lines.  These lines constitute a                signature that is accessible to terrestrial observation and                     analysis, telling us a great deal about the temperature, density,               and composition structure of stellar atmospheres.   This is a                   particularly rich field of study in the case of cool giant stars,               for their light is characterized by an abundance of spectral                    lines.                                                                                                                                                          The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to use millisecond time                resolution spectrophotometry in the observation of cool, bright                 giant stars during lunar occultations.  The goal is to measure                  the mean depths of the formation of spectral features in the                    extended atmospheres of these stars and in the inner layers of                  the dust shells surrounding some of them.  Furthermore, the PI                  will measure the angular diameters of these stars and derive the                dependence of angular diameter on absorption features and the                   stars' colors.",
