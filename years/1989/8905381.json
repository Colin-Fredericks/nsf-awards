 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular                    mechanism in the regulation by heme of the eIF-2-alpha kinase                   (HRI).  The specific claims include (1) determination of the                    molecular mechanisms by which heme regulates the autokinase and                 eIF-2 alpha kinase activities of HRI; (2) cloning and sequencing                of HRI cDNA; comparison of sequences of HRI to those of dsRNA-                  dependent eIF-2 alpha kinase, and other protein kinases and heme-               binding proteins; (3) determination of the genomic structure and                sequences of HRI; comparison of the non-coding sequences of HRI                 to those of genes whose expressions are regulated by heme.  HRI                 will be purified and assays of protein phosphorylation and                      protein synthesis carried out.  The techniques to be used include               gel electrophoresis, amino acid and nucleotide sequencing,                      nucleic acid hybridization and recombinant DNA.                                                                                                                 The proposed studies will advance our knowledge of the control of               protein synthesis, a process that is central to many aspects of                 the activities of a living organism, such as the regulation of                  cell growth, differentiation, antiviral response and hormonal                   response.",
