 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a thre-part analytical program to investigate                           fundammental aspects of Deccan-related volcanism using existing                 well-documented smaples; the goal is to expand knowledge outward                from the intensively studied southwestern region, to begin to                   understand the huge Deccan episode ina plate-tectonic framework                 and with respect to other large continental flood basalts.                                                                                                      1) Existing chemical evidence shows that the lower six formations               of the western Deccan do not simply repeat the geochemistry of                  the Five later, upper level formations, now quite well                          understood.  A Nd, Pb, and Sr isotopic study of otherwise                       thoroughly characterized lavas from the lower formations is                     proposed.  The combined chemical and isotopic data will be used                 to evaluate the nature and evolution of their mantle source(s),                 the roles and mechanisms of contamination early in the Deccan                   succession, and relationships to the overlying formations.  In                  particular, were ancient lithospheric mantle sources supplanted                 by asthenospheric sources; and did AFC processes dominate early                 on, as has been predicted?                                                                                                                                      2)  An even earlier suite of flood basalts from southern and                    eastern Madagascar represents a stage of volcanism (70-80 Myr) in               India proper.  Nd, Sr, and Pb isotopic ratios will be measured on               a set of Madagascar lavas, in conjunction with petrographic,                    major and trace element, and geochronological work by Frency                    collegues, in order to trace the beginning phases of volcanic                   activity.                                                                                                                                                       3)  Though a huge anticlinal structure incorporating the western                Deccan formations has been indentified recently, the geochemical                stratigraphy of the province in a W-E direction remains                         completely unknown.  On extreme view holds that lavas in the                    central and northeastern Deccan are simply distal fringes of the                western formations (up to 1000 km or more away); another that                   most or all of the former were erupted more locally from dikes                  along the Narmada-Son Lineament and thus should reflect their own               unique petrogenesis.  Isotopic, chemical, and petrographic data                 on sections running W-I from Aurangabad, Chikaldara, and Nagpur                 areas will directly text these two conflicting but critical                     hypotheses.",
