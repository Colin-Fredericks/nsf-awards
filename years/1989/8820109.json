 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative              research project in physical organic chemistry between Dionis Sunko             of Zagreb University and Vernon J. Shiner of Indiana University is              to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms and effects of                       nucleophilic displacement reactions.  Understanding of the theory               underlying these chemical reactions are of biological and                       pharmacological interest. Past collaboration has been highly                    successful leading to many joint publications.  The joint project               takes advantage of the complementary stengths of the U.S. and                   Yugoslav research team.                                                                                                                                         This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is funded through a joint             fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and                     Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually               by the Department of State. No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are              made to the principal Yugoslav institute.  Dollar funds are                     included for U.S. scientist travel to Yugoslavia and for Yugoslav               scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
