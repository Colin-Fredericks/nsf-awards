 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Edward Egelman of Yale University to                    collaborate in research with Dr. Jacques Dubochet of the Center for             Electron Microscopy of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.  They           are collaborating in a study of the RecA protein, the most intensively          studied enzyme of general genetic recombination; their approach will            also contribute substantially to improving techniques for the                   structural analysis of macromolecules in general.  Dr. Egelman is a             biophysicist who studies disordered and flexible macromolecules,                specifically the RecA protein and actin.  Traditional methods of                structure determination, such as protein crystallography, have been             generally unsuccessful with these molecules.  Dr. Egelman has been              examining them using computer-based image analysis of electron                  micrographs; he is developing a special facility for this purpose               with support from the Instrumentation and Instrument Development                Program of NSF.  His particular expertise lies in graphics and                  software development; he depends on other laboratories for the                  electron micrographs to be studied.  Dr. Dubochet has pioneered                 methods of cryo-electron microscopy of fully hydrated biological                specimens.  Only a handful of laboratories in the world are working             in that field, and Dr. Dubochet is considered the leading expert on             its use in imaging macromolecules.  He will prepare frozen hydrated             electron micrographs of RecA and other dynamical helical systems,               which will provide one of the best means for both developing and                demonstrating the effectiveness of Dr. Egelman's image processing               hardware and software.  Their complementary expertise and facilities            will accelerate their mutual research on RecA and other dynamical               protein polymers, and both laboratories will benefit from a reciprocal          transfer of specialized techniques.                                                                                                                             The electron microscopy of frozen, fully hydrated biological specimens          has emerged as one of the most promising new developments in structural         biology in the past several years.  It offers one of the most powerful          methods available for visualizing disordered and dynamic helical                protein polymers.  It produces images of specimens with little or no            damage or distortion from dehydration, heavy metal staining or electron         dose.  Dr. Egelman is developing instruments and programs to allow              greatly accelerated analysis of electron micrographs, in particular to          extract information about polymer dynamics and function from static             images.  His techniques for computer-aided enhancement and reconstruc-          tion are even more necessary for frozen, hydrated specimens than for            conventional electron micrographs, due to the problems of weak contrast         and artifacts introduced by the optics of the electron microscope.",
