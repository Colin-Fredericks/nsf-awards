 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program will support an investigation of the                          chemistry of sulfur atoms which are part of metal-sulfur                        cluster compounds. Such compounds are useful models of the                      active sites of a number of important enzymes and also comprise                 an important class of catalysts, some of which are used in the                  chemical industry.                                                                                                                                              The objective of the project is to investigate sulfur-nitrogen                  covalent interactions which result from the reactions of                        nitrogen substrates at sulfur as bound in sulfidometal                          complexes. Initial emphasis will be on dimolybdenum(V) sulfur-                  bridge systems, and both free radical and nucleophilic pathways                 to the formation of N-S bonds will be examined. Specific                        nitrogen substrates to be examined include diazonium salts, azo                 compounds, NO/NO+ compounds, sulfenamide precursors and metal                   dinitrogen complexes. Expected products for these substrates                    are, respectively, diazosulfide complexes, MSNNR;                               sulfenylhydrazines, MSNRNHR; thionitrite compounds, MSNO;                       metallosulfenamides, MSNR2; and MSNNM' complexes. Reactions                     will be monitored and products characterized by spectroscopic                   methods, including NMR (P-31, N-15, proton, C-13), EPR and IR,                  as well as by X-ray crystallography, as appropriate.",
