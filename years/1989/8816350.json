 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research concentrates on the refinement and analysis of                the pathways and cycles of ten biologically essential trace                     elements:  cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu),               iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), vanadium               (V), and zinc (Zn).  These elements are to a variable extent                    essential to land and aquatic plant growth, and a deficiency or                 excess of the individual elements in soils and continental waters               may affect not only the functioning of their own biogeochemical                 cycles, but the cycles of other elements coupled to them as well.               In general, the deficiencies or excesses of the essential trace                 elements in different compartments of the surficial environment                 can be caused by such processes as anthropogenic releases,                      historical changes in the rates of denudation, climatic changes,                changes in the types of vegetation cover, and possibly, releases                from meteorite impacts in the geologic past.  In the first step                 of our work on the ten essential elements we plan to establish                  and refine the mass balance and flux values in the continental,                 aquatic and near-shore oceanic environments.  The second step is                theoretical analysis of the main mechanisms that control the                    fluxes of the ten elements, and of the factors responsible for                  the coupling of their cycles to the global cycles of carbon (C)                 and phosphorus (P).  Third step is development of conceptual and                mathematical models, and their sensitivity analysis, for the                    individual and coupled cycles of these trace elements, within a                 general frame of reference of the carbon and phosphorus cycles,                 as has been worked out in our, and other investigators', earlier                research.  The goals of the proposed work are understanding of                  the baseline picture of the ten essential trace elements in the                 global biospheric change, their potential significance as                       environmental indicators for the geologic past, and obtainment of               the upper bounds on their fluxes and storage rates under                        different sets of environmental conditions.",
