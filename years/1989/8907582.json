They include analysis of                     functions and mappings defined on domains in the space of                       several complex variables as well as studies of the geometry of                 the domains and their boundaries.                                                    Work to be done will include an effort to determine                        whether the limit of a family of compact complex manifolds                      which are all biholomorphic images of the same irreducible                      Hermitian symmetric manifold is again a manifold of this type.                  New techniques for attacking this problem have been introduced                  recently.  In addition, a complete proof for the case of                        complex projective space has been givng.  This work - the                       global nondeformability of irreducible Hermitan syymetric                       manifolds of compact type is a weakened version of one of the                   unresolved parts of the theory of strong rigidity.  The purpose                 of the theory is to show that certain compact complex manifolds                 can be characterized either by topological or curvature                         conditons.                                                                           A second line of investigation concerns continuing                         research on the higher dimensional Nevanlinna theory of value                   distribution of holomorphic functions.  The equidimensional                     case has been highly developed and is reasonably well                           understood.  In this work, the nonequidimensional will be                       considered.  Past methods do not work in this setting and newer                 methods of holomorphic connections will probably have to be                     used instead.  Results in this area have direct connections                     with number theory.                                                                  Additional work will be done on the construction of                        bounded holomorphic functions.  In one sense, the classical                     uniformization theorem answers any such question in one                         dimension since any simply connected Riemann surface is either                  equivalent to the sphere, the plane or a disc.  The same                        classification question concerning the universal covering space                 for compact negatively curved Kahler manifolds has never been                   resolved.   Equivalently, one asks whether the covering space                   admits a large number of bounded holomorphic functions.  Except                 for a few special cases, no one has produced any such functions                 (other than constants).  The recent results of Kohn-Fefferman                   on Holder estimates of projections into spaces of holomorphic                   functions holds out the possibility that their method may be                    transplanted to manifolds and lead to a technique for                           construction of the desired functions.  If that becomes a                       reality, the likelihood of an attack on the Corona problem in                   higher dimensions would finally be realized.",
