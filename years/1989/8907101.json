 "awd_abstract_narration": "Skeletons of massive corals are important recorders of climatic                 and environmental change. Density bands in coral skeletons can be               used as chronometers much like tree rings, recording chemical                   information such as variations in carbon and oxygen isotopes. In                spite of the great interest and importance of these features,                   little is known about how or why density bands form, and about                  the precise relationships between environmental parameters, coral               physiology and the stable isoptope composition. This project will               study the control of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes and                      density banding in coral skeletons through carefully controlled                 laboratory experiments and routinely monitored field colonies. In               the laboratory corals will be grown using seven different                       combinations of light and temperature. Conditions of growth such                as temperature, insolation, isotopic composition of the water,                  isotopic composition of foods, and water composition will be                    continually measured. At the end of the experiment skeletal                     growth will be analyzed for density patterns and carbon and                     oxygen isotopes. Similar measurements will be made on a set of                  field colonies.",
