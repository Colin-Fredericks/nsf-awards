 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study concerns the effects of small-scale turbulence                  and its small scale shear on the growth rate, cell division, cell               size distribution, and cell morphology of marine dinoflagellates.               The aspect of turbulence most important to phytoplankton is the                 local shear, or rate-of-strain which varies over three orders of                magnitude in the ocean.  The rate-of-strain in turn, determines                 the relative velocities for separation distances smaller than the               Kolmogoroff scale, and phytoplankton are smaller than this scale                in the ocean.  Based on previous results, the working hypothesis                of this study will be that differences in species composition of                experimental cultures can be brought about by the inhibitory                    effects of high turbulence.  In controlled laboratory                           experiments, turbulence and shear levels will be computed for the               linear velocity profile and small shears in laminar flow, or                    estimated from established turbulence formulae for higher shear                 rates.  The estimates will be confirmed by hot wire anemometer                  and microconductivity probe measurements.  Constant shear, or                   variable shear under microcomputer control will be produced                     between rotating cylinders over a wide range of Reynolds numbers,               with or without time variation.  Daily measurements of                          chlorophyll fluorescence and cell numbers will be made to asses                 culture growth rates.  Changes in cell size distributions and                   cell division rates will also be measured due to turbulence and                 shear and examine the cells microscopically to assess                           morphological changes.  The threshold turbulence and shear levels               which result in effects on these parameters will be ascertained.                     The microscopic plants called phytoplankton that are                       responsible for most marine biological production must contend                  with unique environmental conditions.  For example although (like               their terrestrial counterparts) phytoplankton require light and                 nutrients, these small and in some cases delicate cells are                     subject to the small scale physical forces of the surrounding                   water, which is 1000 times more viscous than air.  Such small                   scale turbulence is generated in the sea by wind, tidal, internal               wave, and current motions.  This work is a novel collaboration                  between a phytoplankton biologist and a physicist to examine the                effect of these forces on the growth and selected other features                of dinoflagellates, a type of phytoplankton that is suspected to                be susceptible to turbulence.  This laboratory study will be                    carried out in a specially built apparatus in which the physical                turbulence the phytoplankton are exposed to can be carefully                    controlled.  Although the work is a pilot project, the                          interdisciplinary nature of the work by two very capable                        scientists has generated great interest in the potential findings               that may have broad implications beyond dinoflagellates.",
