This project is providing hands-on experience for                    undergraduate faculty in the operation and use of a nuclear reactor,            radiation safety, fundamentals of nuclear reactions, obtaining data by          nuclear methods, data reduction, and interpretation.  The program is            using instrumental neutron activation analysis of short to long half-           life elements, autoradiography, and fission-track dating.  Participants         are involved in a five day field trip to various sites in the Tertiary          volcanic province of the Pacific northwest and ar being introduced in           the field to many problems where the applications of nuclear methods            are appropriate.  Faculty are returning to their home institutions with         three to four projects that include data sets, field samples and                photographs, and plans for the use of the material in undergraduate             classes in petrology, geochemistry and independent studies.                     Participants are being informed as to where and how they can continue           these projects for their undergraduate classes after the program has            ended.",
