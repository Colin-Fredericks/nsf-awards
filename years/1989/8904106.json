 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to elucidate the                       pathway of sensory perception associated with chloroplast                       development in plants.  The process of greening, or                             differentiation of the chloroplast, involves the coordinate                     regulation of many nuclear and chloroplast genes.  The cues                     for the initiation of this developmental program are both                       extrinsic (light) and intrinsic (cell-type and plastid                          signals).  Several regulatory photoreceptor are involved in                     the perception of light signals, but nothing is known of the                    transduction elements that mediate either the external or                       intracellular signals.  The proposed research program                           focusses on a novel class of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants                       previously isolated by the principal investigator.  The                         mutant plants develop light-grown characteristics even when                     grown in darkness, including, leaf development and                              anthocyanin accumulation and are therefore designated det,                      for de-etionlated.  There are at least 2 det complimentation                    groups.  The specific strategic approach will be to                             characterize genetically, biochemically, and physiologically                    the previously identified det mutant, as well identify new                      det mutant classes.  Double mutants will be made to begin                       analysis of gene interaction, which will eventually lead to                     construction of the path(s) which lead to greening.                                                                                                             The characterization of these mutants has already suggested                     that the response to light may be a repression rather than an                   induction phenomenon.  Further work promises to elucidate the                   greening pathways in plants, pathway which must be understood                   for practical as well as basic reason.",
