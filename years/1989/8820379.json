 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most exciting issues confronting contemporary                        neuroscientists concerns the identification and elucidation of                  brain mechanisms underlying learning and memory.  For example,                  recent studies of classical (Pavlovian) conditioning have                       indicated that different brain regions mediate the development of               different kinds of conditioned responses.  For example, autonomic               (heart rate) and somatomotor (eyeblink, leg flexion) conditioning               are all mediated through very different brain structures.                                                                                                       Dr. Gibbs is employing an unique appetitive conditioning                        procedure, which will complement more than three decades of                     aversive conditioning studies.  He is examining whether similar                 brain mechanisms mediate the development of somatomotor and/or                  autonomic conditioning where the unconditional stimulus is                      pleasurable -- the intraoral delivery of a small amount of water.               Specifically, Dr. Gibbs will use this established conditioning                  procedure to determine (a) whether the cerebellum (a structure                  that is essentially concerned with coordinated movements and                    which appears to be essential for aversive somatomotor learning)                is involved in the development of an appetitive, swallowing                     response, and (b) whether other brain structures (primarily in                  the forebrain) also participate in the development of this                      learned response.",
