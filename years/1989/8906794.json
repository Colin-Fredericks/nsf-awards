 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program is the oxidation of organic                    molecules by compounds of the transition metal ruthenium. The                   aims of this research are to elucidate the mechanisms of these                  reactions and to exploit this knowledge to achieve high degree                  of selectivity in the oxidation of organic molecules. It is                     likely that these metal compounds can be used ultimately as                     catalysts for the oxidation of organic molecules by atmospheric                 oxygen, a process of substantial importance in industry and in                  the destruction of toxic substances.                                                                                                                            The mechanistic details of the oxidation of a variety of                        organic and inorganic functional groups by polypyridyl oxo                      complexes of ruthenium(IV) will be investigated. The                            mechanistic work will be extended to the oxidation of olefins,                  aromatic hydrocarbons, amines and other inorganic and organic                   functional groups. An attempt will be made to acquire detailed                  insight into hydrogen atom and hydride transfer pathways which                  occur with large isotope effects, and an attempt will be made                   to establish the existence of long range, proton coupled                        electron transfer pathways. Extensions will be made in the                      underlying descriptive chemistry of metal-oxo complexes, to the                 reactivity properties of dioxo complexes, and to the                            preparation and characterization of complexes in which ligand                   bridges span different metal-oxo sites. The interest in                         multiple oxo complexes comes from their multiple electron                       acceptor capabilities and the possibility of using controlled                   molecular dimensions to achieve oxidative selectivity.",
