 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methods for solving sparse linear systems of equations,                         especially of the type arising from discretized elliptic and                    parabolic partial differential equations, will be studied.  The                 solution of such systems is often the most costly computation in                scientific codes.  Three general areas will be emphasized.                                                                                                      Iterative solution of sparse linear systems of equations,                       including parallel techniques and nonsymmetric systems:                         \"Multicolor\" variants of incomplete factorization preconditioners               display slower convergence than standard preconditioners on                     serial architectures, but theoretical and computational studies                 with model problems show them to be superior on parallel                        machines.  These methods will be tested on problems arising in                  scientific application codes, where it is not certain that they                 will be robust.  Alternatives, such as block ordering methods                   which have less efficient parallel implementations but display                  faster convergence on two-dimensional problems, will be examined.               In addition, new analytic and experimental results suggest that                 iterative methods for nonsymmetric linear systems based on                      partial elimination and \"line\" preconditioners are very effective               for solving the convection-diffusion equation.  Further studies                 of these techniques will be made, including implementation on                   parallel architectures.                                                                                                                                         Numerical methods for three-dimensional problems:  Linear systems               arising from three-dimensional elliptic problems cannot be solved               at reasonable cost at the present time.  Successful development                 of parallel and/or faster converging methods will expand the                    domain of solvable problems, but special attention must be paid                 to the specific issues associated with three-dimensionality.  Two               ideas will be examined:  three-dimensional multicolor schemes,                  and \"plane\" preconditioners (which would generalize line                        methods).  The latter idea build upon effective parallel two-                   dimensional solvers.                                                                                                                                            Parallel implementation of finite element methods:  Finite                      element methods comprise a widely used solution technique for                   elliptic problems that present special difficulties for parallel                computing, including the presence of irregular grids and three-                 dimensional problems.  High order finite element methods appear                 to offer some advantages for parallel solution of two-dimensional               problems on uniform grids.  Starting from this preliminary                      observation, the parallel solution of finite element models on                  irregular grids and in three dimensions will be studied.  Two                   methodologies that will be considered are the combination of                    local direct solution with global iterative solution methods, and               parallel solution using hierarchical basis functions.",
