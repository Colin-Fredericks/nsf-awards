 "awd_abstract_narration": "The blood brain barrier is an absolutely vital intercellular                    defense mechanism in vertebrates and invertebrates. This system                 restricts the nervous system from contact with toxins, water                    soluble compounds and ionic imbalances present in the blood.                    Nerves in particular must be bathed in fluid of special ion                     concentrations and thus cannot have direct access to blood (which               has a different constitution).  The blood brain barrier is not                  always a blessing to life, as many drugs cannot cross this                      barrier to cure or relieve neurological diseases and syndromes.                 (This is especially true for AIDS).                                                                                                                             Insects too have a blood-brain barrier.  Nevertheless, very                     little else is known about this system relative to the growing                  and metamorphosing insect larva.  In many insect species, the                   larval stage is the longest life stage, and the one in which most               economic damage is wrought.  Once the dynamics of this barrier                  are understood in insects and its genesis, placement and extent,                compromising the barrier may be possible.  Insects without this                 barrier would die quickly of natural causes.  It is likely there                may be physical means and/or environmentally safe compounds that                would transiently impair the barrier system in insects and so                   assist in population suppression.  This latter goal would only be               possible after a thorough structural and functional study has                   been made of the larval insect blood brain barrier  as set forth                in the studies.",
