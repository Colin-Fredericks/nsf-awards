 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of growing concern about the direction of economics                     research, the economics profession, and graduate education, the                 American Economic Association established the Commission on                     Graduate Education in Economics to study the nature of the                      training of new PhDs entering the profession.  Based on its                     findings the Commission is to make appropriate recommendations                  concerning graduate education in economics.  This project                       completes the collection and analysis of extensive survey data,                 undertakes several related special studies and prepares a report                bringing together the results of this research, and develops                    whatever recommendations emerge out of the findings of this                     study.                                                                                                                                                          Four central questions give focus to the study:                                 1.  What is the content and structure of graduate education in                  economics?  2.  What are the linkages between the content and                   structure of PhD programs, the nature of dissertation research                  currently underway, and the post-PhD performance of recent PhDs?                3.  Who is undertaking graduate work in economics, and what are                 the trends over time in the flow of entrants and new PhDs?  4.                  What are the prevailing views among members of the profession and               employers of new PhDs about graduate education in economics?                                                                                                    The information needed to answer these and other questions is                   being obtained through questionnaires to graduate departments and               surveys of faculty members, graduate students, recent PhDs,                     employers and department chairmen.  Existing information is                     utilized from such organizations as the National Science                        Foundation, National Research Council, the U.S. Department of                   Education, and the American Economic Association.  Special                      studies are undertaken by outside consultants.                                  %%%                                                                             This is a timely and important study of graduate education in                   economics by the American Economic Association, the leading                     professional association in economics.  The results of this                     project will provide the first systematic study of how the                      economics profession educates, trains, and socializes its new                   entrants, whether into academic life or into the private sector.                The research could motivate and guide educational reforms in                    graduate economics education.  It also could become a model for                 broad-based self analysis that other disciplines will use.",
