 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galveston College is modernizing its chemical laboratory.  The aim of           this project is to use modern IR and GC equipment in the undergraduate          laboratory.  The instruments are used to demonstrate the effectiveness          of spectroscopy and chromatography in solving chemical problems.  They          are used in laboratory experiments including separation, isolation, and         characterization of products obtained through chemical reactions from           natural products or household chemicals.  The acquisitions enhance the          chemical skill of students who advance to upper level courses at                universities or find employment in the chemical industry.  In                   addition, non-science majors benefit from the experience of working             with modern instruments commonly used in chemical laboratories.                                                                                                 The institution is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
