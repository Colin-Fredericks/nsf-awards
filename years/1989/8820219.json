 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State of Louisiana has made excellent progress in                           implementing the EPSCoR program over the last two years using                   its own resources.  The EPSCoR committee remained intact and                    implemented the EPSCoR component projects which were rated                      VERY GOOD - to EXCELLENT by the NSF EPSCoR merit review                         process, conducted in 1986.  While the projects were scaled                     back, due to NSF's declination of the initial proposal, the                     Louisiana Board of Regents provided $3.4 million and  the                       universities provided $6.5 million to initiate EPSCoR.  All of                  these projects have made progress.                                                                                                                              The State of Louisiana has committed $34.0 million in interest                  income annually from off-shore oil windfall monies to                           establish the Louisiana Educational Quality Support Fund                        (LEQSF) for education/research development. Louisiana is                        committed to the expenditure of at least $17.0 million of                       these funds in support of higher education.  A portion of                       these funds will support the Louisiana Stimulus for Excellence                  in Research (LASER).                                                                                                                                            As Louisiana re-submitted only those original components which                  were recommended as VERY GOOD - and above, no new merit                         reviews were requested on these components. However, a site                     visit to determine State commitment was conducted in August                     1988.  Site visitors were Dr. John Margrave of Rice University                  and former member of EPSCoR final panel in 1986; Dr. Dennis                     Willows of Friday Harbor Lab in Washington and former site                      visitor to Louisiana in 1986 and; Dr. Judith Sunley, Division                   Director for Mathematics at NSF , also a site visitor in 1986.                  After consideration of the initial Stage 1 technical reviews                    and a review of progress to date and an assessment of State                     commitment, all three of these reviewers gave the Louisiana                     Proposal high marks.                                                                                                                                            At a meeting with Governor Buddy Roemer, the Governor assurred                  the site visit team and NSF of his personal commitment and                      that of his administration and the State's Legislature.                                                                                                         The Louisiana EPSCoR Plan is a broad-based cooperative effort                   by the Louisiana Board of Regents and the various University                    units.  The Committee's initial assessment of R&D barriers was                  impressive and has subsequently been enriched by the                            development of a \"White Paper\", prepared by the LASER                           committee, entitled \"Prosperity Through Academic Excellence\".                   This document was adopted by the Louisiana Educational Quality                  Support Fund and the Louisiana Board of Regents as policy for                   the State of Louisiana.                                                                                                                                         The Louisiana EPSCoR proposal embraces 13 component research                    projects and 73 targeted researchers from 12 Louisiana                          Institutions.  LSU and Tulane University  participate in the                    greatest number of the projects; however, Louisiana Tech,                       Louisiana Marine Consortium, Southeastern Louisiana                             University, and Southern University all participate.                                                                                                            The leadership of the Louisiana EPSCoR Program is excellent.                    The EPSCoR Chairperson and Project Director are highly                          qualified.  Based on the above analysis and review, an award                    is recommended.",
