 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of better indicators of precollege education in                  mathematics and science can, and should, build on the                           responsibility and interest of states to compile and use better                 information on education.  This project undertakes the                          development of indicators through working with state departments                of education in three stages.  This proposal is to complete the                 Third State-implementation of state reporting of priority                       science/math indicators.                                                                                                                                           In the first year, an inventory was conducted with the states                to identify the information now collected on the dimensions and                 quality of science and math education, using a set of ideal                     indicators identified from recent studies and recommendations,                  and applying a data collection shuttle process to describe how                  each state defines and collects the information.                                                                                                                   In the second year, the information compiles through the                     inventory was analyzed against the ideal indicators and a set of                \"priority\" indicators for states was selected by a project task                 force.  The project developed a common data reporting plan for                  the priority indicators and worked with each state to define                    specifications for reporting state data.                                                                                                                             In the third and fourth years, being proposed, the                         indicators reporting plan will be implemented with the states.                  In year three, 30 states that have indicators data ready will                   report to CCSSO and the other states will receive technical                     assistance to develop their data capacity.  In year four, a                     50-state indicators reporting plan will be fully implemented.  In               addition, the project will obtain state representative data from                national surveys on other priority science/math indicators.",
