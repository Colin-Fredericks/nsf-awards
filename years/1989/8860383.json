 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thermoplastics, being semicrystalline materials, are sensitive to               process history.  Crystallinity significantly affects mechanical                properties.  Relationships governing nucleation and crystal                     growth in fiber-reinforced thermoplastics are poorly understood.                Crystals can be preferentially nucleated at and oriented                        perpendicular to fiber surfaces.  This transcrystallinity has                   been shown to significantly increase heat deflection temperature.               Transcrystallinity would be expected to affect other matrix-                    dominated properties such as transverse tensile strength,                       transverse modulus, fatigue and creep.  Surface treatments,                     involving plasma chemistry processes, of intermediate modulus                   graphite fibers have been shown to induce transcrystalline growth               where fiber manufacturer's surface treatments had no effect.  The               effect of fiber surface chemistry on transcrystallinity, if                     understood, could be used to develop thermoplastic composites                   with improved matrix-dependent properties.  Promotion conditions                for transcrystallinity growth will be investigated through a                    study involving fiber processing, surface chemistry                             characterization, crystalline morphology and composite mechanical               studies.  Anticipated results should define optimum surface                     chemistry conditions for transcrystalline growth.",
