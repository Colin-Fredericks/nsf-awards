 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in neurobiology                  between Dr. George Koob, Scripps Clinical and Research Foundation,              La Jolla, California, and Professor Michel LeMoal, University of                Bordeaux II, France.  The objective of the proposed research is to              study the role of the peptide neurotransmitter corticotronin                    releasing factor (CRF) as a primary mediator of the behavioral                  state of stress and the behavioral responses to stress in the                   central nervous system.                                                                                                                                         Recent studies have shown that CRF liberated directly into the                  central nervous system may have neurotropic actions important for               mobilizing behavioral responses to stress.  The investigators have              designed a set of experiments to identify the specific neural                   substrates for these behavioral actions by direct local                         interacerebral injection of CRF and CRF antagonists.  In addition               experiments are proposed to explore the possible mediation of these             CRF effects via the central and peripheral noradrenergic systems.               An attempt will be made to modify behavioral responses to CRF using             specific pharmacological and neurotoxin induced inactivation of the             central and peripheral noradrenergic systems.  These studies have               important implications for the role of pituitary peptides in brain              function, and may provide important clues to the pathophysiology                associated with behavioral disorders as diverse as depression,                  anxiety, and obesity.  Over the past ten years Dr. Le Moal and his              research group have developed and explored systematically                       behavioral and endocrine correlates of stress, coping and                       behavior.  Dr. Koob's expertise is in classic behavioral                        pharmacology and basic neurobiology.  The expected benefits to U.S.             science from this project include not only the exchange of special              behavioral techniques, but also the gain of valuable expertise                  regarding the measurement of brain function via behavioral                      techniques.",
