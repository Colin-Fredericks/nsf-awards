 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Hong H. Lee,                         Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Florida, to                   pursue with Dr. Sang Heup Moon, Department of Chemical                          Engineering, Seoul National University, during a five-month                     visit to Korea, a program of cooperative research on the                        kinetics of catalyst sintering.  The collaborators will                         investigate the kinetics of sintering that accounts for the                     effects of support pore size on the sintering rate of supported                 catalysts.  Results of this investigation will be utilized in                   the design of catalyst pellets to maximize catalyst life.                                                                                                       In addition to the importance of the project as a basic                         research study, this research may have important applications                   in industrial catalysis, where the effectiveness of the                         catalyst is inversely related to the extent of sintering.  This                 project will add an international cooperative dimension to Dr.                  Lee's ongoing research at the University of Florida supported                   by the National Science Foundation's Kinetics and Catalysis                     Program under Grant No. CBT8601884.  The collaborators are                      highly respected scientists in the field of this research.  Dr.                 Lee is primarily concerned with developing the kinetics of                      sintering for porous, supported catalysts, while Dr. Moon's                     primary research interest is the design of support so as to                     minimize sintering and maximize catalyst life in fixed-bed                      systems.  The present project will allow them to combine their                  talents and interests for mutual benefit.  This project is                      relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative                        Science Program which seeks to increase the level of                            cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers                    through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills,                  and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                  benefit.  Korean participation in the project is supported by                   the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
