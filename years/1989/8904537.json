 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of sedimentary basins are beginning to integrate                   solid-earth phenomena and surficial processes.  In foreland                     basins, conceptujal and quantitative models have reached the                    point at which areful tests are needed of predictions.  The PIs                 will use the Bermejo basin, in the foreland of the Andes in                     western Argentina, as a testing ground.  Mio-Pliocene strata of                 the Bermejo basin are well known on the basis of several                        complementary data sets.                                                             A central objective is to measure the volume of sediment                   preserved in the Bermejo basin in successive 1 to 2 million year                intervals.  The volume history will be compared to the history of               source areas and to the distribution of facies in the basin.                    This information will provide new insight into the constancy of                 sediment supply to a foreland basin on a short time scale and to                the impact that variable sediment supply might have on the                      character of the strata.                                                             The PIs will better constrain the history of deformation by                gathering additional chronological data, for strata which show                  cross-cutting relations to thrust faults and for strata in a                    piggyback basin which is likely to be controlled by thrust                      activity.  Comparison of the thrust history to the history of                   volume of sediments through time will demonstrate the response of               erosion and sediment flux to thrust-indiced topography.  This                   information will be utuilized in the next generation of                         conceptual and quantitative models of erosion of mountain belts                 and stratigraphy in foreland basins.",
