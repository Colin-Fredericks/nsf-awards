 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) and the                     University of Georgia, Department of Science Education, will                    conduct a regional leadership consortium for Middle School                      Life Science teachers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia,                             Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee, leading to the                           establishment of regional resource teams.  Their objectives                     are:  (1) to update the teachers' knowledge in Biology; (2)                     to help teachers design lessons illustrating the relationship                   between biology, society and technology; (3) to help teachers                   select curriculum materials and learning experiences to                         develop problem-solving skills for middle school students;                      (4) to cultivate positive self-concept among the teachers,                      and to (5) design outreach programs of resource teams.  This                    will be two sequential, five and six week summer institutes                     for 48 science teachers and 24 science/curriculum supervisors                   from two districts in each of the 6 states (a total of 72                       participants).  After the second summer institute, the                          resource teams will conduct five 3-day workshops in their                       local district or county.  The leadership consortium will                       include significant partnership with cooperating school                         districts, the University of Georgia, and existing teacher                      centers.  The summer institutes will be conducted by a team                     of scientists, science educators, and master teachers.  This                    project should strengthen science education in the Southeast                    by increasing the number of expert professionals available to                   school districts and teacher centers for local teacher                          education activities.                                                                                                                                           An amount equivalent to 5.8% of the NSF award is being                          contributed by NABT as cost sharing.",
