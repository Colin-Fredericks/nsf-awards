 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for an eight-week long summer REU                 program at the new Aquatic Research Facility at the University of               Kentucky.  The program will provide ten undergraduate students                  the opportunity to participate in aquatic ecology.  These ten                   students will be recruited from seven Kentucky colleges and                     universities and will be matched with a faculty advisor who will                supervise the students work.  To learn the relevant techniques,                 students will begin their session by participating in the                       advisor's ongoing project.  Within 2-3 weeks, the students will                 shift most of their effort into independent research projects.                  Informal weekly seminars during the summer, and evening seminars                in the fall, will stimulate discussion and provide information on               research careers and on major research issues and methods.  After               gathering and analyzing their own data and developing skills in                 critical analysis of the literature and effective scientific                    communication, the students will complete the program by                        presenting their project results orally at an in-house \"research                conference\".",
