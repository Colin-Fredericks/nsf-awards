 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Bellow and Jones will continue their ongoing                    investigation of almost-everywhere convergence questions arising                in connection with the pointwise ergodic theorem along                          subsequences and along other sequences of operators. A.e.                       convergence in mean for certain arithmetic sequences will be an                 especial focus of interest. Calderon-Zygmund type decomposition                 techniques will be used to study such problems. The principal                   investigators will also pursue problems at the other extreme                    involving the strong sweeping out property, where a.e.                          convergence in the sup norm fails very badly.                                        This project is mathematical research in ergodic theory.                   This theory is concerned with what happens on average over the                  long run when a suitable transformation of a suitable underlying                space is iterated many times. (Typically, the underlying space                  might be just a line segment, and the transformation might cut                  the line segment up into pieces, then stretch or shrink and                     rearrange them.) One point of view is to study the behavior of                  functions on the space when their arguments are repeatedly                      subjected to the transformation. It frequently happens that the                 averages of the iterates of the functions converge in a                         meaningful fashion. A recent trend in the subject is to look at                 averages over subsequences, for instance the squares or the                     primes, instead of over all integer indices. Professors Bellow                  and Jones will pursue ergodic theory over subsequences in this                  sense.",
