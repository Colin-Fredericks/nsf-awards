 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little is known about the distribution and functional importance                of nematodes in the snow-free dry valleys of Antarctica.  The dry               valleys have been compared with other desert regions of the world.              Adaptations to low moisture availability and extremes of                        temperature are required of organisms attempting to function in                 stressful desert ecosystems.  This project will examine and                     compare the structure of nematode communities in the dry valleys                of Antarctica with those of better studied desert ecosystems.  The              distribution and trophic structure of nematode communities will be              determined for three dry valleys at the peak of the austral                     summer.  Nematode distribution, abundance, and species composition              will be related to soil physical and chemical properties including              organic C, nitrogen, salinity, pH, and microbial number and                     biomass.  The energy supply of soil will be augmented with sugar                to determine if nematode numbers are energy limited or are limited              by abiotic factors influencing survival.  Nematode adaptations to               low soil moisture (anhydrobiosis) and to low temperature                        (cryptobiosis) will be studied under controlled laboratory                      conditions.  Wind dispersal of nematodes will be studied in Wright              Valley by trapping wind dispersed nematodes along the long axis of              the valley.",
