 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manufacturing of aseptic food packaging is limited in               speed by the two critical and slow steps of sterilization and                   sealing which form two bottle.necks in production lines.  The                   objectives of this research are to increase the rates of                        sterilization and sealing, evaluate the effect of sterilization                 onsealing, investigate alternative sealing (welding) techniques                 and study the effects of these processes on the formation of off                flavors in the food.  The Center for Welding Research (CWR), at                 Ohio State University and the Center for Aseptic Processing and                 Packaging Studies (CAPPS) at North Carolina State University are                both Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers and are                   cost sharing and collaborating on this joint \"Tie\" research                     project.  The researchers at CAPPS will study the use of electron               beam irradiation for sterilization and its effect upon the                      creation of off flavors.  Preliminary work shows irradiation to                 be faster and more effective than current methods.  The                         researchers at CWR will study the use of laser and infrared                     sealing of aseptic packages.  These new techniques permit faster,               more localized, and more controlled heating than conventional                   methods.  The effects of sterilization on sealing quality will be               evaluated at CWR, while the effect of sealing on off flavor                     formation will be studied at CAPPS.  The short term benefits of                 this work are to speed production and reduce cost of                            manufacturing of aseptic food packages.  Long term benefits                     include improved understanding of sealing and sterilization                     leading to development of new processes and new specialty                       materials for aseptic food production.                                                  The Program Manger recommends a grant in the amount of                  $49,972 for two years.",
