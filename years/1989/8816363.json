 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed work is to investigate the                   origin and tectonic setting of 1.1 to 1.8 Ga anorogenic granites                that make up a large part of the crust in the central United                    States.  The study will employ isotopic variations in Nd, Sr, Pb                and O, and trace element patterns to elucidate the nature of                    granite source regions, the process of magma genesis, and the                   evolution of the magmas.                                                             Anorogenic granites from a 600-1000 km-wide band that                      extends across the North American continent.  They were emplaced                during several episodes between 1.1 and 1.8 Ga, and have a major                and trace element chemistry that distinguishes them from other                  types of granites.  Suggested hypotheses regarding both the                     chemical and tectonic sources of anorogenic granites are                        exceedingly diverse and encompass antithetic extremes.  A                       comprehensive isotopic and chemical data base would help                        constrain the possibilities.  This study focusses on four                       complexes located in Wisconsin, MIssouri, and Texas.  All have                  known U-Pb ages, and each is petrographically and chemically                    characterized.  Specific plutons will be targeted for especially                detailed sampling and study.  This approach allows study of both                details of magma genesis in a specific pluton, and the comparison               of plutons among different crustal provinces and intrusive                      episodes.  Both scales of observation are required to identify                  and explain the main features of anorogenic magma genesis.",
