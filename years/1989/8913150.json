 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued collaboration between Dr. Keith               Gubbins, Cornell University, and Professor John S. Rowlinson,                   Physical Chemistry Laboratory, Oxford University, England.  The                 objective of the research is to study the behavior of fluids in                 micropores at the molecular level, using the methods of statistical             mechanics and computer simulation.  This collaboration grew out of              studies of liquid drops, started independently at Cornell and                   Oxford, and has continued actively over the last few years.                                                                                                     The investigators will use statistical mechanical theory and                    molecular simulation to develop a fundamental understanding of the              phenomena associated with adsorption in micropores, including                   selective adsorption of a particular component, phase transitions,              layering transitions, and hysteresis.  The role of such variables               as the type of fluid and solid material, nature of the surface and              pore size, pore shape, and state conditions (temperature, pressure,             and composition) will be studied. The validity of classical                     thermodynamic relations such as the Kelvin equation                             will be examined.  The investigators will then use the results of               this work to suggest the molecular design of advanced adsorbents                for particular applications, including selective extraction of                  particular constituents of mixtures, the storage of natural gas at              low pressure, and improved desiccant materials.  Both the U.S. and              British investigators are at the forefront of work on statistical               mechanics of combined fluids and have made important contributions              to this industrially relevant area of research.",
