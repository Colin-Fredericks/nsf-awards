 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sensory tissues of the nose contain cells that have                         microsopic hairlike processes called cilia.  The membranes of                   these sensory cilia are unlike those of cilia from areas that are               not sensory, in showing higher densities of ultramicroscopic                    particles.  It is believed that these particles seen in the                     electron microscope represent large molecular species such as                   proteins involved in binding important odorant molecules, or                    involved in control of excitation of the cell membrane in                       response to odorant binding.                                                                                                                                    This work will utilize unusual high-resolution electron                         microscopical techniques to explore the nature of these                         particles.  Specific molecular probes will be used that are known               to bind to certain kinds of proteins.  The localization of the                  bound probe molecules will be used to infer the identity of the                 membrane components, and study their distribution.  These                       morphological properties will be compared data from biochemical                 and physiological studies, to clarify how chemosensory signals                  are produced in response to the presence of odors.  This issue of               transduction, where an stimulus is converted into a nerve signal                to the brain, is fundamental to the operation of sensory systems.               The very demanding techniques in the hands of these particularly                skilled investigators promise advances in understanding such                    transduction processes.",
