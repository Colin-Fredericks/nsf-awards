 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to develop an                    interactive, computer-aided graphical construction and viewing                  environment to be used in studying the geometric entities which                 represent the spatial loci of joints equivalent to planar                       Burmester curves.  The entire construction process, based on                    Burmester's original geometric principle, will be available for                 display and evaluation.  This is necessary to correlate portions                of the geometric entities with the design specifications and                    physical characteristics of the resulting linkage.  Revolute and                prismatic joints will be treated as restricted cylindrical                      joints, thus allowing for a common construction approach using                  screw axes.  Spherical joints must be handled separately.                            This program is expected to be a valuable aid to                           researchers, educators, and designers in furthering the                         understanding, visualization, and use of the geometric entities                 associated with spatial joints.  The construction and viewing                   environment will be conducive to studying relationships between                 the geometric entities and the physical linkage, e.g., crank                    rotatability, branch problem, and order problem.  The development               of these areas of study should greatly improve the practicality                 and efficiency of synthesizing spatial linkages.                                     To maximize portability, the coding will be in standard                    FORTRAN-77.  The graphics will be in accordance with the PHIGS                  standard.",
