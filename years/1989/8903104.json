 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central theme of this project is the tower of normed                   matrix spaces that sits over certain kinds of normed linear                     spaces, for instance subspaces of the algebra of bounded                        operators on Hilbert space. Completely bounded maps and tensor                  products will be studied in this setting. Additional aspects of                 the project include work on Hilbert modules over function                       algebras, and investigation of invariant subspaces for operators                composed of an ergodic transformation and a multiplication.                          The mathematical research to be pursued here is aimed at                   fundamental questions in the theory of operator algebras.                       Operators may be thought of as enriched numbers, obeying the same               laws of arithmetic as ordinary numbers with two notable                         exceptions: multiplication of operators depends upon the order in               which the factors are taken, and not every non-zero operator has                an inverse. In the finite-dimensional situation, operators are                  just square matrices of numbers, the basic objects of linear                    algebra, and even at this stage the richer structure becomes                    apparent. Infinite-dimensionally, notions of size and distance,                 as measured by what is called the norm of an operator, become                   crucial. How these norms behave when subjected to various                       constructions is one of the foci of this project. Another focus                 is the study of certain algebras of operators that come from                    higher-dimensional complex geometry.",
