 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) in Puerto Rico is a                 high quality tropical forest research site with a history of                    long-term research programs.  The LEF is a National Forest and a                Biosphere Reserve, which contains several research natural areas                within its 11,231 ha.  The objective of this project is to tie                  studies of disturbance regime and forest structure and dynamics                 to an ecological landscape perspective.  The two primary research               questions address (1) the relative importance of different                      disturbance types within the four tropical rain forest life zones               of the LEF, and (2) the importance of specific elements of the                  biota in  restoring ecosystem productivity after disturbance.  A                combination of long-term (10-40 year) and short-term (3-5 year)                 experiments will provide research components addressing: pattern,               frequency, and intensity of disturbance; environmental properties               expected to vary with disturbance size, age, and origin;                        biological properties expected to vary with environmental                       properties; and system properties emergent from the effects of                  disturbance pattern, severity, and frequency on the mutual                      interaction of environment and biota.  Existing and newly                       generated data sets will incorporated into a comprehensive data                 management system to insure prompt data reduction, timely                       dissemination of information to collaborators and other research                projects, and secure long-term data storage.                                         The research site is an excellent one operated under the                   stewardship of the USDA/Forest Service.   The Forest Service will               also participate in the research through the activities of its                  resident scientists.  The University of Puerto Rico will provide                excellent facilities for the work.  The multi-institutional                     research team is very strong, well organized and firmly                         committed to the requisite collaborative research mode of                       operation.  Results of this undertaking will be important to the                progress of basic ecological science as well as to the management               of the living resources of tropical forest ecosystems.                               The Ecosystem Studies Program regards the LEF site and                     research team as a valuable addition to the national network of                 Long-Term Ecological Research projects.  Accordingly, a six-year                continuing award is recommended in support of this project.",
