 "awd_abstract_narration": "A REU Site program in mechanical engineering is established                     involving a community of faculty and students who will be                       actively engaged in both individual and group research efforts.                 Each faculty member will work directly with one or two students                 on research projects and will participate in activities for the                 entire group.  The students will assist a faculty member in                     research, do independent research under the guidance of the same                faculty member, and participate in a program of seminars and                    research meetings.  Approximately half of the students will come                from schools other than the host institution.  The students will                be involved in projects in the areas of biomedical technology,                  power and propulsion, design and productivity, industrial                       engineering, heat transfer and thermodynamics and environmental                 engineering and particle technology.  Research projects include                 photoelectric pressure distribution sensors, robust scheduling                  systems, high temperature solar processing, and                                 microcontamination in high purity gases.",
