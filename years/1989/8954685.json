 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Teachers Association proposes to                      initiate steps to produce a major reform in the scope,                          sequence, and coordination of secondary science education in                    the United States.  The first step in this endeavor is to                       conduct three meetings which will determine the framework for                   this reform.                                                                         The first meeting is the Preplanning Meeting of 15-20                      leaders from science education, scientific, and engineering                     organizations.  This group will address the opportunities and                   problems associated with a change in secondary science                          instruction.  The group will establish the agenda for the                       second meeting, the Strategy Conference, which will convene                     in July, 1989.                                                                       The Strategy Conference, of approximately 100                              participants, will garner broad support and establish an                        implementation plan for the reorganization of secondary                         science.  The Conference will also identify pilot sites to                      begin the reform effort.  Conference proceedings will be                        widely distributed.                                                                  The third meeting is the Project Planning Meeting which                    will consist of approximately 15 participants including                         education officials from each of the school districts which                     will serve as pilot sites.  This meeting will set the agenda                    and plans for organizational reform beginning with the pilot                    districts in 1989-90.  All three meetings will be thoroughly                    documented and evaluated.                                                            Cost sharing--$16,025 or 15% of the total cost of this                     project.",
