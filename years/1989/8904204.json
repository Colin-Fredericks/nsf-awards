 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cold Spring Harbor Symposia are held yearly .  They bring                   together approximately 300-400 scientists from all over the world               to present and evaluate new data and ideas in rapidly moving                    areas of biological research.  The topic for the 1989 Symposium                 is Immunological Recognition.  It will focus on the following                   topics:  Antibody structure and epitope recognition, antigen                    uptake, processing and presentation, the induction and breakdown                of self-tolerance, transmembrane signalling in lymphocyte                       activation, the structure of MHC molecules, peptide binding by                  MHC molecules, epitope recognition by T lymphocytes, the                        generation of T cell and B cell repertoires, and antigen                        receptors and ancillary molecules on T lymphocytes.  The Symposia               always seek to bring research workers from abroad, as well as the               U.S., so as to ensure the wide scope and depth of the program and               to take advantage of their specific contributions.  They also                   seek to provide outstanding younger scientists, both graduate                   students and post-doctoral fellows with an opportunity to                       participate and communicate with more senior scientists.  The                   Symposia also bring together scientists who use a variety of                    approaches, e.g. genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, cell                biology, and structural studies.  The proceedings of the Symposia               are published by the Laboratory and thus made available to a                    wider audience than the scientists who attend the meeting.                                                                                                      This Symposium promises to further the progress of basic research               in immunobiology.",
