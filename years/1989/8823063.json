 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Traugott Fischer of Stevens Institute             of Technology to collaborate in materials engineering research with             Professor Alain Mocellin of the Ceramics Laboratory of the Federal              Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland.  The objective of             their collaboration is to enhance understanding of the properties of            certain advanced ceramics and of the processing techniques for                  achieving them.  The Swiss group will prepare test ceramics with well           defined processing and properties, and provide these to the U.S.                group for further study.  Tribological research at Stevens will then            relate friction and wear of the ceramics to the mechanical properties           of the materials.  These properties depend on the size of the grains,           the nature of the additives and the processing.  The collaborative              arrangement efficiently links two laboratories with complementary               equipment to produce, characterize and test the behavior of novel               ceramic materials.                                                                                                                                              There is presently intense activity in many countries with the aim of           developing and applying novel high performance ceramics.  Some                  notable successes have been achieved, mainly in the metal forming and           cutting industries, but the wider application of these materials,               for example in textile machinery and advanced engines, is still                 meeting with mixed results.  Success in the fabrication and application         of these materials will follow the further development of our                   understanding of their properties and of the processing techniques              for producing them.",
