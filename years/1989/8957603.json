 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Presidential Young Investigator is performing                           research in large distributed computer systems with adaptive                    decentralized resource control, i.e., collections of                            decision-making agents which reside on a geographically                         distributed set of computers and which control resources so                     that work can be carried out in an integrated and coordinated                   fashion.  Finding good methods for adaptive decentralized                       control addresses the question of how to make task and                          resource allocation choices correctly and efficiently in                        light of the formidable problems which arise as a result of                     distributing control.  Probably the most difficult of these                     problems is that multiple agents must make good fast                            coordinated decisions based on uncertain and differing views                    of the global system state.                                                      The research approach is experimental.  The Principal                          Investigator will create a laboratory to work on problems of                    load balancing, network routing and distributed sensing and                     interpretation. The laboratory will consist of multiple                         workstations with a file server, interconnected by a variety                    of different networks for work on decentralized coordination                    protocols under different topologies, a general purpose                         multiprocessor allowing for experiments to be conducted with                    notes acting as controlling agents numbering in the hundreds                    of thousands, and development software, including prototype                     object-oriented programming environments and expert system                      environments.//",
