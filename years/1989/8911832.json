 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the rise of modern science in the 16th and 17th centuries,                 both scientists themselves and the general public have turned to                science to provide solutions to the problems which confront us.                 Sir Francis Bacon, the most famous of the early propagandists for               science wrote of a scientific utopia, a \"New Atlantis\" in which                 men and women, freed from sickness, ignorance, and the need to do               hard physical labor, could engage in intellectual pursuits deemed               appropriate for our stature, somewhere between the animals and                  the angels.  This ideology has permeated the scientific                         tradition.  It's contemporary manifestation can be seen in the                  eugenic movements and genetic engineering--i.e. the drive to use                science and technology to create the perfect human.  Human                      genetic research has discovered the genes which cause a number of               human disorders while reproductive technologies like prenatal                   testing, in vitro fertilization or fetal therapy allow a mother                 to strive for the perfect child.  Dr. Rothschild, under this                    research grant, is examining the historical and conceptual                      framework which underpins eugenics and genetic engineering.  She                is tracing a secularized belief in human perfectibility, linked                 to beliefs in science and the idea of progress.  These beliefs in               both science and human perfectibility developed from a 17th and                 18th century ideal to becoming an integral part of 19th and 20th                century evolutionary and eugenic ideology.  During this grant,                  Dr. Rothschild is developing the framework and the idea of the                  \"perfect man\" that emerges from it. This will form the foundation               of her study of the relationship of the \"perfect child\"--the                    modern image of human perfectibility--and the new reproductive                  technologies that are shaping the image and making it possible.                 By focussing on human perfectibility and its interplay with                     science and technology in both historical and contemporary                      context, this research brings to light an important by neglected                element in the growing debates on the meaning and impact of the                 new reproductive technologies for procreative norms and choices.",
