 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a general consensus that the major inspirations of                     contemporary Russian psychology came from physiological models of               Russian reflexologists and from the Marxist social sciences.  The               physiological paradigm found its best known realization in                      Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity and in numerous                      modifications of it.  Roughly speaking, Pavlovians took an                      experimental formation of a salivary reflex in dogs as a research               model and gradually developed it into a concept aimed at                        explaining the whole of animal and human behavior in terms of                   what they called \"properties of the Central Nervous System.\"  The               social theory trend has its roots in the 1920's when                            psychologists struggled to formulate a \"new psychology\" which                   would correspond to the social formation of a \"new man\" of a                    socialist society.  Professor Kozulin's goal in this research is                to trace back a third inspiration for contemporary Russian                      psychology, a humanistic tradition which derives its theoretical                models and receives its inspiration from the humanities and more                specifically from philology, discourse analysis and literary                    scholarship.  This tradition which is not well known in the West                responds to the strong \"literary\" tradition of the Russian                      national culture and creates a case for a specifically \"Russian\"                psychology.  This humanistic tradition was resurrected because of               the crisis which both modern Soviet neuroscience and socially                   grounded psychology experienced in the post-war period,                         especially in the 1960's.  The humanistic tradition is best                     exemplified in the \"life as authoring\" concept of Mikhail Bakhtin               (1895-1975) and the study of the psychological relevance of                     literary form by Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934).  Their studies have                  been rediscovered by Feodor Vasiliuk and used in his work in the                1980's to offer an alternative approach to psychology from the                  physiological and the Marxist approaches then in crisis.                        Professor Kozulin's study of this third tradition of Russian                    psychology thus offers both psychologists and historians greater                insights into current developments in Soviet science.",
