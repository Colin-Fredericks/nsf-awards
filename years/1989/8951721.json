 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amid growing concern over toxic waste and pollution of                     drinking water resources, the need for well-educated                            hydrogeologists increases.  The aim of this project is to teach                 students methods for the detection of ground water pollution,                   particularly pollution by waste disposal facilities.  This will                 be done by improving the already-existing program in hydrogeology               at Northeastern Illinois University.                                                                                                                                 Major instruments to be purchased under this program include               a mobile motorized auger, which students will use to learn                      methods of drilling, logging, and developing monitoring wells,                  and a pressure transducer-type water level indicator, which will                allow students to make tests of the water-tightness of landfill                 covers.  For detection of pollution, a gas chromatograph and                    spectrophotometer will enable students to chemically analyze                    water samples to detect and quantify pollution by leaking toxic                 wastes.                                                                                                                                                              This project is significant because it will train                          hydrogeologists in the areas most needed today.  Identifying the                paths and rate of movement of leaking landfill leachate is                      crucial to detection and remediation of polluted water.  Toxic                  waste cleanup efforts have shown that studying the interactions                 between water and organic chemical wastes is of paramount                       importance.  If today's students are to address these problems as               tomorrow's scientists, they must learn the proper methods of                    research.                                                                                                                                                            The institution will match the award with an equal amount of               funds.",
