 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar on \"Metallothionein in Biology and            Medicine,\" organized by Prof. Curtis D. Klaassen of the University of           Kansas Medical Center, and Prof. Kazuo Suzuki of the National                   Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan.  Participants              will meet in Honolulu, Hawaii, in December 1989 to exchange recent              research results and promote future joint research projects.  The               seminar will deal with the general biological and chemical properties           of metallothionein; its physiological and nutritional aspects;                  transport of metallothionein  within the body; diseases derived from            metallothionein; methods of analysis of metallothionein; and use of             metallothionein in medicine.                                                                                                                                    Metallothionein is a protein which is easily taken into tissues in the          presence of cadmium.  Since current work on metallothionein grew out            of cadmium contamination of the Japanese environment and subsequent             physiological disorders, the Japanese have become expert in this                field.  This seminar may improve the understanding of metallothionein:          while the dynamics of metallothionein  uptake and transport has been            to some extent well-delineated over the past few years, its function            is still unknown.  The multidisciplinary approach evidenced by the              diversity of those invited may lead to a breakthrough in understanding          the function of metallothionein, and therefore its good and bad                 effects.",
