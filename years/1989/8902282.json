 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout the biological sciences there is an increase in the                  need to access all of the current data available on a given                     subject.  The complexity and breadth of the biological sciences                 makes it impossible to have ready access to the full data                       resources on even one subject, leave alone the myriad topics                    under intense investigation.  Mega projects like the Human Genome               Initiative have made this shortage of data sharing more obvious                 to the whole scientific community.  Yet, despite the need for                   rapid action there is a shortage of trained investigators and                   the need for new theory and systems.  An experimental database                  representing the detailed information about a very heavily                      studied region of mouse chromosome 17, the H-2 gene complex, will               serve as the model data system for broad theoretical and                        practical development of database tools.  The experimental model                system offers all of the molecular genetic and cellular biology                 problems found in larger projects but only focuses on                           approximately 3 megabase pairs of mouse DNA, part of which has                  been fully sequenced.  This model system will serve not only for                theory development and testing but as a training tool for new                   investigators, commercial software vendors and computer                         scientists wishing to explore applied database problems.  This                  research platform will be an effective core for outreach                        workshop and symposia as well as specialized training sessions.                 This format should speed database development, which otherwise                  could extend over decades as other new database programs have in                other fields.",
