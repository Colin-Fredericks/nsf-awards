 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Educational Leadership and the New                       York Academy of Sciences believe that there is a critical                       nexus between efforts to reform science and math education                      and the broader school reform and restructuring agendas.                        Indeed, available evidence suggests that absent structural                      reform of our public schools, the potential to improve K-12                     science and math education on a broad scale is limited.                              The primary objective of this project is to determine                      how to involve leading scientists and their professional                        organizations, in education reform.  If scientists can be                       come involved they can help propel school reform forward,                       even as they promote the basic changes that are required in                     science and math education.                                                          The objective of the project will be achieved through                      the implementation of two conferences.  The focus of                            discussion will evolve from a working paper developed for                       both conferences.  The meetings will be held in New York and                    California and will include attendance by some of our                           nation's leading scientists.  A final report based on the                       conferences will recommend to the National Science Foundation                   strategies to involve scientist more extensively in education                   reform.
