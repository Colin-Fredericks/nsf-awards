 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of                    California at San Diego will acquire several sea-going                          systems and items of oceanographic instrumentation to be                        placed in a pool of shared use equipment.  This equipment is                    maintained for use on or in association with the four                           research vessels operated by the institution.  A substantial                    part of the ships' operating schedules during 1989 is in                        support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The instrumenta-                   tion will also increase the capabilities of the ships and of                    the institution to support research and engineering                             activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                      -Shipboard data management systems and components for real-                      time acquisition and display of large data sets,                               -Doppler Current Profiler spares for reliable collection and                     continuous measurements of subsurface circulation features,                    -Environmental sensors for multiple-opening and closing net                      system.                                                                        -CTD enhancements for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater                     conductivity and temperature as a function of depth,                          -Salinity bottles for storing seawater samples,                                 -Niskin bottles for collecting discrete seawater samples at                      various depths in the water column,                                            -waterguns and depressors for an acoustic seismic profiling                      system upgrade,                                                                -High-speed streamer for single-channel acoustic profiling,                     -Precision acoustic pingers for determining position of an                       instrument package relative to the surface or seafloor, and                    -12-kHz echosounder system for collecting data on seafloor                       bathymetry and sedimentary profiles.                                                                                                                           The University of California is cost sharing in the                             acquisition of this equipment.  The instrumentation described                   above will increase the capability of the organization to                       support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.",
