 "awd_abstract_narration": "The description of respiratory mechanical behavior is complicated by            the elasticity of the upper airways and trachea.  From the principles           of conservation of mass and momentum and the acoustic image of the              upper airways and trachea, a model of these airways will be derived             that incorporates the elastic behavior of the airway walls.  With this          model, contribution of the large airways to the overall system                  impedance will be calculated.  The respiratory system is inherently             nonlinear.  Its mechanical properties change with operating point and           during the breathing cycle.  Changes in the level of respiratory flow           and/or changes in the neural control message to the system may be               responsible for this.  Dr. Fouke will estimate these \"time-varying\"             impedances in order to study the underlying respiratory control                 mechanisms during the breathing cycle.                                                                                                                          The instructional and interactive components contain three elements.            Dr. Fouke will teach a new course in the biomechanics of the pulmonary          system for undergraduate and graduate students, serve as coadvisor for          the Society of Women Engineers, and organize a seminar series                   featuring prominent women scientists and engineers from across the              nation.  The unique feature of this seminar series is that it will be           videotaped and offered as part of the Corporate Classroom                       teleconference educational program available to companies in the New            Hampshire and Masschusetts area.  This program last year served over            400 students in 40 locations, and will therefore have significance              both to Boston University and the greater corporate community.                                                                                                  This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to provide           opportunities for women to advance their careers in engineering and in          the disciplines of science supported by NSF and  (2) to encourage               women to pursue careers in science and engineering by providing                 greater visibility for women scientists and engineers employed in               industry, government, and academic institutions.  By encouraging the            participation of women in science, it is a valuable investment in the           Nation's future scientific vitality.",
