 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent evidence suggests that handicapped students are not as                   adept in spatial and temporal skills as their mainstream                        counterparts.  Difficulties in judging distances, working                       with direction and orientation, and problems with scale                         changes mark this special group of individuals.                                                                                                                 This project recognizes and addresses the special needs of                      the teachers of these students.  Efforts are directed toward                    enhancing teachers' understandings of the key elements of                       spatial understanding: scale, estimation of distance and                        size, direction and orientation, data gathering (spatial),                      perception-conception, and interpretation and symbolization.                                                                                                    Macalester College and the Minneapolis Public Schools are                       cooperating in a joint venture to enhance the spatial                           abilities of the teachers of junior high school handicapped                     students.                                                                                                                                                       The project is to run for two academic years: September, 1988                   through July 1990.  During the first year a series of eight                     instructional sessions will be conducted.  The target                           audience for this series will be twenty teachers of                             handicapped students.  During the summer of 1989 a two-week                     workshop will be held.  The primary out-come of the first                       year will be formalized packages for teachers in the                            Minneapolis school system.                                                                                                                                      During the second year of the program, another series of                        academic year sessions will be held for teachers from all                       school districts in the Twin Cities area having a significant                   number of handicapped students.  During the summer of 1990, a                   two-week workshop will be held for all the teachers who                         participated in the two-year program.                                                                                                                           Through the funding of this project, the Teacher Enhancement                    Program addresses the special needs of a particular                             contingent of teachers, those working with handicapped                          students.                                                                                                                                                       Macalester College and the Minneapolis School have                              contributed an amount equal to 3% of the National Science                       Foundation award.",
