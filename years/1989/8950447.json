The HPLC is used in Organic as a                     preparatory instrument for micro laboratory tecniques.

The HPLC is used in Organic as a preparatory instrument for         micro laboratory techniques. In Analytical Chemistry HPLC is used to            determine trace quantities of pollutants in surface, ground and                 drinking water.  Plans are being made to implement this instrument in           to introductory chemistry and also chemical instrumentation.  The               introduction of HPLC gives students the opportunity to have hands on            experience with up-to-date technology.  The institution is matching the         NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
