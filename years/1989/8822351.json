 "awd_abstract_narration": "The majority of stars occur in binary, tertiary, and still higher               order systems.  Some of the stars in binary systems are in such                 close proximity of each other that they strongly effect each                    other's structures and evolution.  In such \"interacting\"                        binaries, one frequently observes mass transfer from one star to                the other, an accretion disk around the mass receiving star, and                heating and structural distortions of the stars' atmospheres and                the disk.                                                                                                                                                       The Principal Investigator proposes to study these phenomena in                 the case of a selected group of interacting binaries, employing                 simultaneous photometry and spectroscopy.  The instrument to be                 used will be the one-meter Illinois reflector that is now located               at the Mount Laguna Observatory 50 miles east of San Diego and                  maintained by the Astronomy Department of the San Diego State                   University.  The work will be carried out in collaboration with                 Dr. Paul B. Etzel of the San Diego State University.",
