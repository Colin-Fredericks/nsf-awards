 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sensory input often can be enhanced by specific behaviors for                   looking, listening, sniffing or feeling.  Rodents have large                    facial whiskers, the vibrissae, that are used to investigate                    objects by touch.  Studies on anatomy and physiology of the                     rodent vibrissal system have examined cellular mechanisms of both               sensory integration and the role of experience during                           development, particularly in relation to the somatosensory cortex               of the brain.  Sensory capabilities of the vibrissae themselves                 usually have been inferred from gross deficits seen after whisker               removal, but little is known about how well these hairs can                     detect or discriminate various natural stimuli.                                                                                                                 This project uses a novel approach to determine how the vibrissae               are used in behavior to make sophisticated tactile                              discriminations.  Blindfolded animals will be trained to                        distinguish between surfaces of calibrated roughness; there is                  evidence that the rodents can discriminate with vibrissae at                    least as well as primates using fingertips.  Video-based analysis               will quantify amplitude, frequency, speed, and relations of                     whisker movements and head movements.  The role of sensory input                during development will be tested by trimming rows of whiskers of               neonatal rats until they are 45 days old, then allowing whisker                 growth.  This manipulation is known to produce abnormalities in                 the somatosensory cortex of the brain, and expected to produce                  discrimination deficits in the adults.  Behavioral strategies                   will be compared between normal and neonatally deprived animals,                to see how whisker movements are used to discriminate, and                      whether new strategies are learned.  Finally, the whiskers will                 be studied as they interact with the surface, and the time                      patterns of whisking will be compared to the timing of excitation               and inhibition seen in nerve cells in the somatosensory cortex.                 These novel studies will fill a critical gap in our knowledge                   relating brain function to tactile behavior; results will have a                high impact not only on somatosensory science, but on sensory                   science and neurobiology, and on studies of learning and                        behavior.",
