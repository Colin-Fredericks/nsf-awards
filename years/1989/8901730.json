The first involves the relationship between the                   \"generic\" large cardinal axioms and conventional large cardinal                 axioms.  Closely related to this is the problem of whether                      aleph-omega is Jonsson.  A successful resolution of these                       problems would unify the various proposed strengthenings of the                 ordinary assumptions of mathematics.  If the results                            conjectured by the P.I. are true it would also shed                             considerable light on the continuum hypothesis.                                      The second type of problem examines the combinatorial                      characteristics of definable partial orderings and graphs.                      Frequently, adding a definability hypothesis to a class of                      partial orders implies that they have very nice properties,                     devoid of the \"pathologies\" induced by arbitrary choice.                             The third kind of problem involves investigating                           applications of set theory in functional analysis.",
