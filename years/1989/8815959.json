 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will examine the chemical ecology of many of the most        abundant and conspicuous benthic sponges in the shallow continental             shelf waters of Antarctica.  This represents the first comprehensive            analysis of toxicological and feeding deterrent characteristics of              marine sponges in any polar system.  The multi-bioassay approach will           employ a variety of organisms including embryonic, juvenile and adult           marine invertebrates, and marine vertebrates, which co-occur with               sponges.  Recent evidence suggests that toxicity is common in antarctic         sponges.  Importantly, those sponges which reveal biological activity           will be chemically analyzed to isolate and elucidate their active               metabolites.  Moreover, given the high potential for novel chemical             compounds, extracts of antarctic marine sponges will be tested for anti-        viral and anti-tumor activity.  The proposed study will facilitate an           understanding of latitudinal and taxonomic patterns of toxicity in              marine sponges and, ultimately, provide important information on the            role of chemical compounds in the ecology of antarctic benthic                  communities.",
