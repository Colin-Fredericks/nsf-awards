The ICOSSAR conferences are international in participation and                  significance, and also cover all technological areas with regard to             problems of structural safety and reliability.  The forthcoming                 conference will emphasize the implementation and application of                 reliability-based design and analysis.  This is expected to help                establish methods of mitigating the potential loss of property, human           life and societal productivity arising from the functional and                  physical failure of critical engineering systems due to multiple                natural and man-made hazards.                                                                                                                                   The subject of structural safety and reliability and related                    applications of probabilistic analysis are now much more widely                 recognized as an important part of engineering and engineering                  education.  The conference will greatly enhance the potential of                engineering applications of safety and reliability of structures.",
