 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microwave and millimeter were computer aided design (CAD) programs              currently available do no include the effect of parastic coupling,              that is unintended coupling between elements of the circuit not                 electrically connected. Such coupling can have a significant effect on          a circuit's performance as packing densities and frequencies of                 operation are increased.  In this Research Initiation Award, a new              method of incorporating parasitic coupling into circuit modeling                programs is investigated.  The method takes advantage of the weak               nature of the coupling (10 to 30 dB) by using a perturbational scheme           in which the modifications to the currents in the isolated elements             are calculated in a fast, efficient manner.  The method promises to             improve the speed of existing modeling algorithms significantly, and            yet be at least as accurate when realistic roundoff limitations are             considered.  The algorithm is also speeded  up by the development of a          uniform, asymptotic expansion of the matrix elements which represent            the parasitic coupling.  The method will be tested on a number of               simple, canonical structures and checked against experimental                   measurements and results from other available codes.",
