Laboratory                                            experiments will be conducted to determine                                      the effects of both small and large scale                                       fracture aperture variations on the                                             dispersion and retardation of solute                                            migrating through a channelized, fractured                                      porous medium.  Experiments investigating                                       small scale aperture variations will be                                         analyzed to determine the fluid flow and                                        solute dispersion which arises from fluid                                       migration through regions of the fracture                                       that subjected to a considerable degree of                                      rock-to-rock contact.  Experiments assessing                                    the effects of large scale aperture                                             variations will investigate the highly mobile                                   flow channels which develop in a fractured                                      porous medium and provide a basis for                                           estimating the mass transfer of solute                                          between highly mobile fracture channels and                                     the less mobile areas within the fractures.                                     The results of these experiments will be                                        combined with a theoretical analysis of                                         transport processes to estimate the                                             dispersion and retardation of solute                                            migrating through channels in fractured rocks                                   due to interactions with low mobility fluids                                    in the fracture and diffusion and adsorption                                    of solute in the rock matrix.  The resulting                                    solute transport model can then be used to                                      simulate contaminant migration in                                               channelized, fractured media.                                                                                                                                   This research is likely to improve current                                      models used in describing the process by                                        which fluids and solutes move through                                           fractured porous media.  This is of                                             importance in predicting the impact of                                          pollutants from storage sites on groundwater                                    quality.",
