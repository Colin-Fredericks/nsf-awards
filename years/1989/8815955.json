 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a seminar on \"Finite and Infinite Dimensional           Dynamical Systems,\"  organized by Prof. Shui-Nee Chow of the Georgia            Institute of Technology and Prof. Kyuya Masuda of the University of             Tokyo.  Participants will meet in Kyoto, Japan, on July 17-21, 1989             to exchange recent research results and promote future joint research           projects.  The seminar will deal primarily with partial and ordinary            differential equations as dynamical systems on finite- and infinite-            dimensional spaces.  This fairly recent approach has been applied to            certain important systems, but the theoretical basis for such                   application is as yet relatively primitive.                                                                                                                     This multidisciplinary seminar will bring together researchers in such          areas as classical ordinary and partial differential equations,                 abstract ergodic theory and dynamical systems, and map theory; as               well as experimentalists.  Discussion will center on general approaches         to dynamical systems, treatment of traveling waves, turbulence,                 chaos, and problems in gas and fluid dynamics.  These discussions may           have important implications for the development of new and efficient            simulation methods for fluidmechanical systems.",
