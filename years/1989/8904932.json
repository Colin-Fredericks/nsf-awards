 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with transaction processing in a multi-                      database environment. A Multidatabase System (MDBS) is a                        collection of several, locally controlled, databases. It is                     assumed that local database management systems (DBMS) are not                   aware of each other and cannot exchange concurrency control                     information. The objective is to develop systematic methods for                 maintaining semantically related information in a consistent and                reliable manner. The investigation is focused on transaction                    management issues that arise when global and local transactions                 are processed concurrently in a multidatabase system. Specific                  research problems include:                                                                                                                                      1. Extension of the existing theory for concurrency control and                 recovery in distributed database systems to the case of                         multidatabase systems.                                                          2. The design of a mechanism for transaction management in a                    multidatabase environment, such that each local DBMS uses the                   same concurrency control mechanism.                                             3. Performance evaluation of various transaction management                     systems in a multidatabase environment.                                         4. Development of a theory of transaction management for                        cooperating multidatabase systems in a heterogeneous hardware                   and software environment.                                                                                                                                       The results of this research will form theoretical foundations                  for transaction handling that will be beneficial to large-scale                 industrial multidatabase systems development.",
