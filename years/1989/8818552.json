 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although most plants reproduce as both seed parents and                    pollen parents, knowledge of the factors that control the amount                of plant reproduction is, in most cases, limited to understanding               of seed production.  Because plants generally produce more pollen               than seeds, there is an opportunity for extensive variation in                  ability of plants, acting as pollen donors, to sire seeds.  The                 variation may be produced by differences in pollen grain                        germination, differences in pollen tube growth, and differences                 in embryo growth and survival depending on the source of the                    pollen.  Which mechanism actually produces differences in pollen                donor success is not known for any plant.  This research will                   examine the mechanisms that produce differences in fertilization                success among pollen donors of wild radish, Raphanus sativus.                   The research will involve experimental crosses using pollen                     donors of different genotypes followed by measurement of paternal               success and examination of the processes that produce those                     differences.  This work will increase basic understanding of the                neglected half of plant reproduction, performance of pollen                     donors.  Understanding of the factors that control plant                        reproduction is essential to selection for continued productivity               in crop plants.",
