Further, the computing power associated with these                  systems provides a cost-effective computing resource for groups                 of investigators.                                                                                                                                               This award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program and the                    Division of Advanced Scientific Computing will be used by the                   Department of Chemistry at Rice University to help acquire a                    networked computer system.  The areas of chemical research that                 will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following:                                                                                                      1) Projects in quantum chemistry                                                2) Molecular beam reactive scattering                                           3) Computer simulations of kinetic processes on silicon and                        diamond surfaces                                                             4) Dynamics of photodissociation in small polyatomic molecules                  5) Computational analysis of highly excited and reactive                           molecular systems                                                            6) Metal and semiconductor cluster surface science                              7) Quantum chemistry in support of photophysics and                                photochemistry research.",
