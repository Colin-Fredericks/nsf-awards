 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of an earlier project that                       investigated the accumulation of fine-grained sediment on the                   continental shelf near the mouth of the Amazon River.  The                      earliest research proved that sediment was actively                             accumulating, and later research identified the sedimentary                     processes controlling accumulation.  This project will examine in               detail the operation of the processes and how they affect the                   formation of sedimentary strata.  This new research will be                     done as the Sedimentology and Stratigraphy portion of AmasSeds                  (A Multi-disciplinary Amazon Shelf Sediment Study), which is a                  cooperative project between US and Brazilian scientists.  The                   project involves collaboration of Physical, Chemical,                           Biological and Geological Sciences.                                             %%%                                                                                                                                                             The project will investigate boundary layer flow and suspended                  sediment dynamics in the shallow marine environment.  In view                   of progress to date and the capabilities of the                                 instrumentation, the next logical step is to extend the work to                 include wave-current interactions and the details of shelf                      sediment transport.  The proposed objectives are divided into                   four major unresolved issues resulting from prior Amazon                        studies:  (1) sediment accumulation, (2) physical reworking,                    (3) dispersal of river sediment, and (4) origin of fine-scale                   stratigraphy.  The project will use the shelf tripod GEOPROBE                   to collect data to address these issues and also construct a                    suspended sediment profiling system and use a high frequency                    echo sounder to investigate river sediment dispersal budgets                    and fluid mud properties respectively.  Cooperative field                       studies are planned for four stages of river discharge                          beginning in 1989.",
