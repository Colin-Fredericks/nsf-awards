 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the establishment of a simulated factory as a             laboratory for automation and robotics.  This automated factory                 simulation would involve industrial robots in an actual manufacturing           production environment wherein the complex interrelationships between           pieces of automated equipment on a factory floor could be taught.  The          equipment required includes industrial robots and robot trainers to be          used as lab equipment on the production floor of the factory.  This             equipment will be integrated with existing robotic equipment to                 produce a unique laboratory for undergraduate students.  As a result            of this lab, students will learn not only the discrete and specialized          tasks of different types of automation systems, but also how those              different systems fit together in a computer-integrated manufacturing           environment.",
