 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic matter produced by C3 and C4 grasses in North                      American prairies possesses distinct isotopic signatures.  These                labels show genetically and environmentally based variation                     which is fairly well understood theoretically but not                           characterized well ecologically.  The labels are transmitted in a               quantitatively predictable manner to higher trophic levels and,                 in a less understood manner, to soil organic matter (SOM).                      Prairies comprising C4 and C3 systems will be studied to                        establish quantitative relationships among composition,                         proportional productivity, biomass delta 13C, biochemical                       composition, and SOM delta 13C.  Analysis of particle size                      fractions and soil aggregates will indicate whether SOM and                     vegetation are in a steady state or successional.  Comparisons                  among many prairies may show the presence of any consistent                     directional change in composition during the recent past and last               1,000 years.  Fine and course grained soils in shortgrass and                   tallgrass systems will be compared and it will be determined                    whether or not phytoliths can be used to distinguish between                    shortgrass and tallgrass components.  The range of naturally                    occurring delta 13C values in plants and compartments will be                   documented and related to growth forms and environmental factors.               Studies of prairies and old fields with known land use histories                will allow an estimation of rates of turnover of particle size                  fractions and soil aggregates.  An analysis of several late                     Pleistocene and Holocene paleosols will be undertaken.",
