 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Systems Analysis Department at Miami University has a long history          of educating software engineers who are in high demand by computing             industries.  The hardware and software currently being used in this             educational process is state-of-the-practice technology, rather than            state-of-the-art.  This project involves 6 workstations and associated          software to be connected via an Ethernet.  The emphasis in this                 equipment is on (1) a visual approach to analysis, design, and                  programming; (2) automation of tasks; (3) the use of integrated tools;          and (4) resource sharing.                                                                                                                                       The computing industry has been faced with a \"software crisis\" in the           past two decades in which the size and complexity of software has               exceeded our ability to control.  Quality has lagged, schedules have            been delayed, and cost estimates have been overrun.  The use of                 automated, more visual, integrated tools and better resource sharing            holds much promise as a solution to this crisis.  By introducing                students to this technology, they can eventually help to improve the            quality of software produced in industry.",
