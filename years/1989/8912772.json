 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, societal interest in the transfer of technology                from university to industry has made the development of                         appropriate linkage mechanisms to industry a major issue at a                   broad range of research universities.  Dr. Etzkowitz is                         documenting the origins and legitimation of university-industry                 linkage mechanisms such as consulting, research contracts,                      centers and formation of new firms.  He is investigating these                  issues in the context of the experience of MIT, one of the first                and certainly among the most heavily involved of research                       universities which have sought industrial connections.  Dr.                     Etzkowitz is  examining the circumstances that gave rise to                     linkages between MIT and industry and is analyzing how the                      relationships that developed modified MIT's academic role,                      changed the functions of the institution; and affected the way                  that industry interacted with MIT.  The integration of such                     activities into the academic enterprise was often problematical                 even at an institution like MIT which is ostensibly devoted to                  the support of industry.  A series of controversies over industry               relations took place at MIT that will be the focus of this study.               The historical examination of these issues and how they were                    resolved at MIT can provide a framework for understanding                       contemporary conflicts over university-industry ties and provide                guidelines for their resolution.",
