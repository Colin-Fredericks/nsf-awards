 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds for technical assistance and for             equipment useful in structural analysis of various proteins and nucleic         acids.  The equipment items include computational tools useful for the          analysis and interpretation of data obtained through X-ray                      crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, and other instruments useful in           the preparation of samples for analysis by these techniques.  The group         of investigators who will benefit from the award include                        internationally known experts in use of these techniques of structural          analysis and other, equally respected biologists whose research will            benefit greatly from collaboration with the structural experts.                     The development and application of 2-dimensional NMR spectroscopy           and X-ray crystallography to the study of the structure and function of         biological macromolecules is currently one of the most exiting areas of         biological research.  In recent years, rapid progress has been made in          the development of computational tools that allow these techniques to           be applied to a variety of molecules rather than, as previously, to the         few molecules most amenable to such analysis.  The simultaneous                 development of molecular genetic and other, biochemical techniques have         also increased the variety and sophistication of the structural                 questions that can be approached with these techniques.  The equipment          and technical assistance provided by this award will enable a group of          outstanding molecular geneticists to collaborate and to instruct each           other in the use of the most recent advances.",
