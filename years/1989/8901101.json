 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Automorphic Forms of                   Professor Michael Harris of Brandeis University. Dr. Harris's                   research project is to study the number-theoretic properties of                 holomorphic and nonholomorphic automorphic forms, and relations                 with special values of L-functions. His principal tool for attack               of his chosen problems will be the cohomology of the toroidal                   compactification of Shimura varieties.                                               Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of Modular and Automorphic Forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of Geometry and Analysis, it                      retains connection to its historical roots.",
