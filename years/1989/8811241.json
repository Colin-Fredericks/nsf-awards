 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the renewal of research on the principles and                      application of controlled nucleation during alpha aluminum                      oxide phase transformation.  It was established that by                         controlling the nucleation of the reaction through the addition                 of crystallographically similar substrates (i.e., seeds) upon                   which the reaction is initiated epitaxially, the nucleation                     barrier to reaction is almost eliminated, the incubation period                 for reaction is significantly reduced, the reaction time and                    temperature are reduced, and the particle size is reduced.  The                 current grant includes the study of these principles on                         lead-based perovskites, lead magnesium niobate and lead zinc                    niobate.  The studies focus on the epitaxial relations between                  the seed crystal and mixed metal oxide precursor, growth of the                 nucleated perovskite as a function of transport path,                           microstructural evolution and electrical properties.  Polymeric                 sols will be used to study epitaxial relations as a function of                 lattice mismatch and transport path.  Seeded sols will be used to               determine transformation kinetics, microstructural evolution and                for preparation of specimens for evaluation of electrical                       properties.                                                                                                                                                          The materials being investigated are used in the electronic                industry for dielectrics.  They are difficult to synthesize with                reproducible properties.  The research under this grant is                      relevant to new processing techniques which lower the processing                temperature, and potentially improve control of the structure.                                                                                                  Training of students with experience to perform research on                     these technologically important materials is a significant                      component of the grant.",
