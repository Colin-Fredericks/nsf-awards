 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has improved the physical chemistry laboratory                experience at Carson-Newman College by introducing four                         experiments and upgrading a fifth.  There are two unique aspects                of this project.  First, an equation of state apparatus (not                    commercially available until 1988) that acquaints students with                 the properties of real gases such as liquefaction and critical                  temperature and prepares students for newly-developing                          applications of super critical fluids.  Second is an innovative                 experiment that utilizes a high speed clinical osmometer so that                in a single laboratory period students can obtain a large amount                of data illustrating the principles of the Donnan equilibrium and               molecular weight determinations.  In addition, bomb and solution                calorimetry experiments are introduced and the conductivity                     experiment has been upgraded.  The institution is matching the                  NSF grant with an equal amount of funds.",
