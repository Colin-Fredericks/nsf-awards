 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports paricipation by ten U.S.                    scientists in the 1989 International Conference on Plasma                       Physics to be held November 22-28, 1989 in New Delhi,                           India.  The conference attempts to bring together physicists                    whose research covers the entire area of plasma physics                         dealing with fusion, space, laboratory and astrophysical                        plasmas.  In addition to the conference itself, numerous                        satellite meetings and workshops will provide occasions to                      bring scientists together in different centers of plasma                        physics research in India.  The co-organizer is Professor A.                    Sen of the Institute for Plasma Research in Bhat,                               Gandhinagar, India.                                                                                                                                             Scope:  This conference being held in New Delhi represents a                    combination of the 8th Kiev Internation Conference on Plasma                    Theory and the 8th International Congress on Waves and                          Instabilities in Plasmas which were held separately in the                      past.  This combination provides for interaction between                        important subfields of plasma physics.  The meeting will                        also help highlight the results of the growing efforts of                       the last several years in plasma physics research in India,                     and bring to focus the potential benefits of collaboration                      and exchange of information between U.S. and Indian                             scientists in the fields of fusion and space physics.",
