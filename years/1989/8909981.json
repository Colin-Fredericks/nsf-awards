 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an attempt to develop a method for determining the                      oxidation state of surface layers of metal-oxide catalysts                      during a catalytic reaction.  Up to now, such data have been                    unobtainable except under very unrealistic conditions.  The                     method combines transient kinetics at atmospheric or near-                      atmospheric pressures with spectroscopy (especially Auger                       electron spectroscopy) under ultrahigh vacuum.  Two types of                    oxides are studied:  thick (micron-sized) films of one-and                      two-componement oxides on polycrystalline gold, and thin                        (nanometer-sized) films of spinels grown epitaxially on single                  crystals of gold.  Raman spectroscopy and low-energy electron                   diffraction are used to characterize the films.  Ethanol is                     used as a chemical probe; both acid-base and redox reactions                    are followed.                                                                                                                                                   Metal oxides are technologically important materials because                    of their strength, stability, and varied optical, electric,                     and magnetic properties.  In the fabrication of oxides, as                      well as in many of their applications, surface properties are                   important.  The materials studied in this project are typical                   of many multicomponent systems used in industrial                               applications.  This investigation of the relationships between                  atomic structure, composition, oxidation state, and surface                     chemical reactivity therefore has wide applicability,                           especially for materials design using the principles of                         molecular architecture.",
