It's content will be made available to              those involved in the development and use of behavioral models                  entering the design of critical structures under a variety of                   environments. Structures in a severe environment require a level                of sophisticated calculation that utilizes the proper constitutive              equations. For example, dams, nuclear power plants, offshore and                onshore platforms will have to satisfy earthquake resistance codes,             and are designed using finite elements programs based on those                  equations. Researchers in America and other countries have already              offered to add their data to this base. Ongoing and future research             will also add to the data base. It is expected that the center will             become self-supporting in three years, after which it could                     continue on its own or be incorporated as part of one of the                    designated test sites for geotechnical experimentation.",
