 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has recently been shown theoretically that soliton-like waves can be         guided by optical waveguiding structures containing at least one Kerr-          type, self-focusing medium, and that under conditions of high                   excitation, spatial solitons can be emitted from such a nonlinear               structure.  This has led to the prediction of new soliton-based single          waveguide devices such as optical limiters and all-optical switches, as         well as new modes of coupling between isolated waveguides.                                                                                                      This proposal concerns a combined program of theory and experiment, with        theory leading the way, to establish the feasibility of observing and           utilizing spatial-soliton-based nonlinear guided-wave phenomena in              integrated optics.  The investigators will initially:  (a) extend their         previous 2-D cw studies to full 3-D simulations; (b) incorporate more           realistic material nonlinearities and assess their effects on these             phenomena; (c) address the full 4-D spatio-temporal problem which is            associated with pulsed inputs; and (d) search for new soliton-based             devices for single and multiple waveguides.  Based on these calculations        and in parallel with them, experiments will be initiated to investigate         both spatial and temporal soliton effects in nonlinear waveguiding              structures.",
