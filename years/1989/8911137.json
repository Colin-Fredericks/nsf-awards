 "awd_abstract_narration": "The marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium uses an unidentified                    mechanism to protect its nitrogenase enzyme from deactivation                   by oxygen.   Several cellular oxygen consuming reactions may                    minimize the in vivo oxygen concentration during periods of                     photosynthesis.  Analysis of the mechanisms proposed to date                    indicates that there remains to be discovered a significant                     oxygen consuming process in the Trichodesmium colonies.  The                    hypothesis being tested is that the photoreduction of oxygen                    (Mehler reaction) removes a significant fraction of                             photosynthetically evolved oxygen.  Tests of this hypothesis                    and measurement of other oxygen consuming reactions require                     stable isotope techniques.  Two related O-18 techniques are                     capable of determining photosynthetic oxygen evolution and                      oxygen consumption rates in the light:  membrane inlet mass                     spectrometry and O-18 isotope dilution techniques.  The methods                 to be used are either new or have been confined to laboratories                 before.  With modern, reliable and compact mass spectrometers                   it is feasible to conduct stable isotope techniques at sea.                     %%%                                                                             The nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Trichodesmium must possess                   some mechanism whereby its nitrogenase enzyme is not                            deactivated by oxygen produced during photosynthesis.  The                      photoreduction of oxygen (Mehler reaction) is a possible                        pathway which will be investigated in thei project.  A newly                    developed mass spectrometer and oxygen 18 isotopes will be used                 at sea in the Caribbean to  test the hypothesis that the Mehler                 reaction of general importance in Trichodesmium.",
