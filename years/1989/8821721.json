 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research consists of three closely related empirical projects               focusing on Unemployment Insurance (UI) and the layoff-recall process.          In conjunction with the empirical work is a theoretical component of            econometric research, aimed at developing and testing estimators for            econometric duration models, which have broad application and are less          sensitive to a priori assumptions.                                                                                                                              The first project examines the fraction of the unemployment of UI               recipients arising because of temporary layoffs and the effects of              recall expectations on unemployment spells.  The second involves the            analysis of re-employment bonus experiments that are being conducted in         several states.  These experiments provide large monetary awards to UI          claimants who find jobs quickly.  The third project analyzes a data set         that matches five years of longitudinal UI histories from eight states          containing 385,000 spells with information about firms.                         %%%                                                                             Unemployment Insurance (UI) is an important and expensive social                welfare program.  In 1985, 2.6 million people received unemployment             insurance at a cost of over 15 billion dollars.  Substantial                    theoretical work indicates that the (UI) program has major effects on           the behavior of both workers and firms.  The purpose of this research           is to better understand these effects and to develope techniques to             better estimate the magnitude of some of these effects.                                                                                                         This research consists of three closely related empirical project               focusing on the effects of Unemployment Insurance.  The first examines          the disincentive effects of UI on taking a job and the effect of                expecting to be rehired on looking for a new job.  The second examines          a new group of social experiments which are designed to find ways of            reducing the typical period of unemployment and, thus, UI program               costs.  These experiments offer special bonus payments to people who            find work within a specified period of time.  The third project will            use a unique data set to analyze the effects of UI benefits and taxes           on the behavior of workers and firms.",
