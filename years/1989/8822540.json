 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crustaceans comprise a diverse arrray of arthropods that                   have come to inhabit nearly all possible habitats on earth, from                mountain soils to the deep sea.  Dr. Lawrence Abele has studied                 their evolution and ecology using morphological data from whole                 organisms and thin sections of tissue, as seen with light and                   electron microscopy.  More recently, he has learned the most                    current molecular techniques for unravelling the evolutionary                   relationships among different crustacean groups.  Dr. Abele                     proposes to analyze ribosomal RNA sequences of representative                   species from each of the major crustacean groups (including                     remipedes, branchiopods, cephalocarids, ostracodes, and crabs, to               name a few).  Evolutionary relationships will be reconstructed                  from these sequence data, and compared with patterns of                         relationships inferred from morphological data.                                      The proposed research would have significant impact on a                   large and diverse audience of biologists.  Crustacea have evolved               a wide array of morphologies, behavior, and ecological habits,                  and the molecular study of their evolutionary history will                      provide a framework for understanding how, and when, and how                    often these various traits have appeared.  These new and                        independent data will open new areas of research, and will deepen               our understanding of the Crustacea and of the evolutionary                      process.",
