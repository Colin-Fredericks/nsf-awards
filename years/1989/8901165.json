 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theme of Professor Zhu's mathematical research is to                   relate function theory on certain higher-dimensional complex                    domains to the growth of certain operators on spaces of                         functions analytic in these domains. The domains in question may                be thought of as solid objects whose points are located by                      several complex, rather than real, numbers. Functions on the                    domain assign complex numbers to these points, possibly in a                    rather noisy manner or, at the other extreme, with the                          regularity and predictability of the analytic functions, which                  are given by power series in the coordinates. The circumstance                  that intrigues mathematicians is that essentially every                         function, no matter how noisy and badly behaved, has an                         extremely well-behaved analytic part. This correspondence, which                really has to do with operators on spaces of functions, turns out               to have important applications in more or less concrete settings,               for instance in the design of feedback-stabilized control                       systems.                                                                             The specific goals of the project relate to the operators                  obtained by compressing or skew-compressing multiplication by a                 function, called the symbol, to a distinguished space of analytic               functions, generally a Bergman space. Membership of the operator                in various distinguished classes (bounded, compact, Schatten                    classes) is to be characterized in terms of properties of the                   symbol.",
