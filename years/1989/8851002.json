 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combining coursework with an apprenticeship program, this 2.5-year              project will prepare \"crossover\" teachers from other disciplines to             teach middle school mathematics and science.  Each summer, the 56               participants will attend a three-week summer workshop at which they will        study appropriate mathematics and science content and related teaching          strategies.  The 28 science teachers will focus on chemistry and                physics, while the 28 mathematics teachers will study problem-solving,          probability and statistics, and other topics in middle school                   curriculum.                                                                                                                                                     Teams of four teachers from the same district will be led by a master           teacher who will provide guidance and support during the academic year.         Academic-year activities will also include eight meetings of                    participants with the project staff.  The evaluation will identify those        characteristics that promote the success of \"crossover\" teachers in             their new role.                                                                                                                                                 The university and the school districts are contributing in cost-               sharing an amount equal to 32% of the NSF award.",
