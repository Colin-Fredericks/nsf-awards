 "awd_abstract_narration": "The system of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds provides an                ideal source of information on the history of these two galaxies.               By measuring the ages of the clusters and by determining their                  chemical abundances, it is possible to reconstruct the history of               the rate of cluster formation, as well as to explore the question               of chemical enrichment.                                                                                                                                         Dr. Hodge will continue observational work on key star clusters                 using state of the art detectors.  He will concentrate on three                 special problems: 1) clusters containing Cepheid variables; 2)                  cluster lifetimes as a function of position and cluster mass; and               3) very young clusters as condensations in star forming regions.                An important by product of this work is the comparison of                       observations with theoretical evolutionary tracks of ages and                   abundances that are not available from well populated clusters in               our Galaxy.  Furthermore, photometry observations allow a test of               the distance determination of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which                 has been questioned.",
