 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on the metabolism and enzymology of                         nitrogen oxides, chiefly but not exclusively in denitrifying                    bacteria.  Recent success in the purification of nitric oxide                   and nitrous oxide reductases from Paracoccus denitrificans                      and of a new type of nitrous oxide reductase (cytochrome c-                     containing) from Wolinella succinogenes permits further                         detailed characterization of these enzymes, purification of                     the analogous enzymes from other bacteria for comparison, and                   raising of antibodies to test for antigenic similarities                        across species.  Structure and function will be determined                      for the chromophoric lipid associated with nitric oxide                         reductase.  The structural gene for nitric oxide reductase                      will be cloned and sequenced.  The kinetics of NO uptake and                    production and the steady-state levels of NO will be studied                    in denitrifying and enteric bacteria with use of a recently                     devised NO-electrode and hemoglobin trapping methods.  These                    studies are directed at resolving the question whether NO is                    an intermediate in denitrification and exploring the                            generality and enzymology of NO production from nitrite by                      enteric bacteria.  The mechanism of enzyme-catalyzed                            nitrosations and the possible participation of NO in these                      reactions will be studied with use of nucleophiles that yield                   a nongaseous nitrosylated product, e.g., morpholine and 2,3-                    diaminonoaphthalene.                                                                                                                                            The ability of certain bacteria to reduce nitrogen oxides to                    nitrogen was described in the last century and termed                           denitrification.  The process is energy yielding and                            represents an alternative to aerobic respiration.                               Denitrification is of considerable importance geochemically,                    because it represents the major route for return of fixed                       nitrogen to the atmosphere as N2.  It therefore must serve in                   the mechanisms which control the amount of oxygen the earth's                   atmosphere.  It is clear that the biochemical mechanisms of                     denitrification are not as well understood as those of some                     other areas of nitrogen metabolism.  A detailed understanding                   of these mechanisms might lead to inhibitors of                                 denitrification in agriculture and the facilitation of N2                       production in, for example, sewage treatment.***//",
