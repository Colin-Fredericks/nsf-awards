 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will develop a theory of minimal                surfaces for Kahler manifolds.  Special emphasis will be paid to                the relationship between the complex tangent points and the                     Riemannian geometry and stability properties of these surfaces.                 He will also investigate the relationship between the                           characteristic forms of vector bundles and the singularities of                 bundle maps.  And he will extend his past work on harmonic maps                 to infinite Grassmannians.  A new study of symplectic topology                  will begin.                                                                          Minimal surfaces are the mathematicians' soap films.  Exotic               minimal surfaces can be formed by dipping ordinary curved wires                 into a soap and water solution.  Great progress toward a complete               understanding of these surfaces has been made in recent years.                  Now, the principal investigator and other geometers are using                   these new theories to build connections with the emerging                       geometrical physics of Kahler manifolds.",
