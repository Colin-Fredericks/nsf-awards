 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering problems sometimes involve the numerical                       solution of boundary value problems over domains containing                     geometric features with widely varying scales.  Often, a detailed               solution is required at one or more of these features.  Small                   details (for example, cracks and flaws) in large structures may                 have profound effects upon global structural performance.                       Conversely, large-scale conditions may have effect on local                     performance (for example, tectonic stresses may cause rock                      failures near tunnels).  Many man-hours and CPU-hours are                       currently spent in modeling such problems.  With the proposed                   structural zooming technique, it is now possible to design an                   integrated program which allows the analyst to interactively                    focus upon a small region of interest, to modify the local                      geometry, and then to obtain highly accurate responses in that                  region which reflect both the properties of the overall structure               and the local detail.                                                                The structural zooming technique is a general technique that               can be applied to the numerical solution of a set of partial                    differential equations.  It can be applied to problems in                       computational structural mechanics (for example, in automobile                  and aerospace engineering), fluid mechanics, geomechanics and                   geotectonics, fracture mechanics, and electromagnetics.  Problems               with widely varying geometric scales of interest exist in each of               these areas.  The use of the structural zooming technique could                 result in more accurate analysis at specific regions of interest                at a lower cost.  During Phase II of this project, the Principal                Investigator proposes to concentrate the research in the area of                structural mechanics.",
