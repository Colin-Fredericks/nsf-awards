 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from Michigan State University (MSU) requests funds               to establish a Science and Technology Center in Microbial                       Ecology.  The Director of the Center will be Professor James M.                 Tiedje.                                                                                                                                                         To achieve the goal of the Center the research has been organized               around three key areas of knowledge: the genetic features of                    organisms, the physiological capacity of these organisms, and the               effect of the environment on these organisms.  The Center is                    intended to make the greatest impact on the unanswered questions                important to understanding the success and function of organisms                in their habitat.                                                                                                                                               The research program will be organized under selected component                 projects that contribute to the three key areas.  The projects                  will be gene pool accessibility, population diversity, community                diversity, novel organisms, substrate availability, environmental               control, adhesion, natural toxins, chemical analysis, and DNA                   probe methodology.  Each of these has a well defined research                   scope consisting of short term goals (3-5 years) and longer range               objectives (10-11 years).  The individual projects interact in                  many ways to advance understanding of broader issues.                                                                                                           An example of the project interaction is the problem of                         developing new processes to biodegrade hazardous wastes.  This                  requires information on novel dechlorinating organisms and their                isolation from nature (Novel Organisms), and on whether critical                genes can be amplified or transferred in these unusual organisms,               or requires novel vector development (Gene Pool Accessibility).                 The exploitation of these organisms may require that they be                    retained (Adhesion), and that the process be sequenced to degrade               byproducts (Environmental Control).                                                                                                                             In all of its research the Center will build on basic principles,               drawing together the relevant disciplinary resources to solve                   particular problems.                                                            Funding from industry as well as other Federal agencies will then               translate these principles into highly useful technology.",
