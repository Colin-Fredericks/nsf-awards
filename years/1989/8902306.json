 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major objective of PRA/STIA is to encourage                                   greater understanding of the research university                                system of the United States because it is both the                              center for scientific research and for education of                             future scientists.  This system has been undergoing                             change over the past twenty years and will                                      experience even greater changes over the next two                               decades.  It is important to gauge how major                                    societal and technical changes have affected, and                               are likely to affect research universities.                                                                                                                     For these reasons it is timely to bring together                                scholars and policy analysts concerned with research                            universities to discuss the results of several major                            research projects on the subject.  Such discussions                             will likely be of specific value to PRA as well as                              to other Federal decisionmakers.                                                                                                                                The Pennsylvania State University Institute for                                 Policy Research and Evaluation and the Center for                               the Study of Higher Education will host a workshop                              on \"Research Perspectives on Research Universities\"                             held April 14-15, 1989 at Pennsylvania State                                    University.  PRA/STIA will support the cost of this                             workshop, with associated costs being covered by the                            University.  The workshop will include eight                                    sessions, concerned with historical, international,                             university-industry relations, Federal policies, and                            sponsored research.  The last session will be a                                 roundtable discussion.  A workshop report will be                               prepared and other channels for disseminating the                               results will be used.",
