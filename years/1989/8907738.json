This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long and                Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The program             is designed to enable young U.S. scientists and engineers to                    conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the conduct of             joint research and the utilization of unique or complementary                   facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in foreign                    countries.                                                                                                                                                      The award will support a 12 month research visit by Dr. Marsha Black,           University of Tennessee, with Dr. Aimo Oikari of the University of              Joensuu, Finland.  The researchers will use a tiered approach using             both laboratory and field exposures to study the elimination of two             pulpmill effluent components (dehydroabietic acid and 3,4,5-                    trichloroguiacol) and benzo\u0131a!pyrene by fish via the gills, skin,               kidney, and hepatobiliary system.  Compound excretion patterns and              rates of metabolite formation by trout will be quantified using an              experimental chamber.  Excretion of the model compounds will be                 characterized with and without preexposure to dilute pulpmill                   effluent or \u001a-napthoflavone, a potent inducer of the monooxygenase              enzyme system.  Following these laboratory experiments under                    controlled conditions, whitefish will be caged in a lake receiving              pulpmill effluents at locations 3-15 km from the effluent discharge             area.  Fish removed at specified intervals over the 6 month                     exposure period will be analyzed for metabolizing enzyme activities             and metabolites of dehydroabietic acid and 3,4,5-trichloroguiacol.              Results from laboratory and field studies will be used to evaluate              the role of xenobiotic excretion in the adaptation of fish to                   chronic low-level pollution.                                                                                                                                    The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as appropriate,               international travel, local travel abroad, stipend, dependents'                 allowance, if applicable, and a flat administrative allowance of                $250.00 for the U.S. home institution.",
