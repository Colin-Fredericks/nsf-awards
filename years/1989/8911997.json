 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the discipline of geography has undergone dramatic                transformations in recent decades, much of its development remains              strongly influenced by events and processes begun in the early years of         its formal establishment as a scholarly discipline in the United                States.  Much of the material on which more detailed and comprehensive          histories of the development of American geography can be built are             written materials stored in archives in the United States and Europe.           This project will enable one of the foremost historians of American             geography to spend considerable time examining materials in these               archives in order to expand and enrich general understandings of key            activities and themes in the discipline's development from the 1880s            through the 1940s.  The outcomes of this research will include articles         in scholarly journals and chapters in a book that will consider the             first century of the development of geography in America.  Publications         also will ensue that will make the contents of these archives better            known to other scholars.                                                             By intensively examining material related to the early history of          scholarly geography in America, the investigator will improve his own           understandings of the discipline's development, insights that will be           shared with scientists through scholarly publications.  The elucidation         of archival materials also will heighten the potential for other                scholars exploring the history of geography to conduct their own                research.  Through these systematic investigations of the evolution of          crucial conceptual and methodological developments in the discipline,           the abilities of contemporary practitioners to conduct their work more          effectively will be enhanced.",
