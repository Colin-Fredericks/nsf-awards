 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to study kidney function and osmoregulation during             avian embryonic development.  Current knowledge of kidney function in           embryonic/fetal amniotes has been restricted to basically one species           of mammals due to the difficulty of invasive maternal surgery and               catheterization required for conventional infusion and clearance                studies.  The proposed experiments are designed to take advantage of            the chick embryo as a versatile accessible  model for kidney function           druing early development, mid devlopment and late development.  This            system allows easy accessibility to the embryo and extraembryonic fluid         compartments by making a small window in the eggshell on the second day         of incubation, and using microtechniques to determine glomerular                filtration rates, electrolytes, urine flow and compartmental volumes            during the developmental stages.  In one group of embryos, the effects          on development of having only one kidney will be determined.                                                                                                    Since undergraduate science students will be involved in all aspects of         this project, Dr. Murphy will provide a stimulating atmosphere to               encourage these students to pursue upper division and graduate studies          in the basic sciences.",
