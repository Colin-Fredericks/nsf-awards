 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will allow a student in cultural anthropology to                   conduct research leading towards a dissertation.  The student                   will live in a Mayan Indian community in northern Guatemala, and                will explore how a subordinate population of peasants tries to                  renegotiate the terms of its situation by studying an unusually                 harsh case, that of Mayan Indians who have been occupied by the                 Guatemalan army following an unsuccessful guerrilla uprising.  By               focusing on the postwar reconstruction in northern Guatemala,                   studying the land distribution projects and the rapid growth of                 evangelical Protestant churches, the project will contribute to                 an understanding of how poor peasant communities defend                         themselves in the face of external pressure.  Methods used will                 include participant observation, archival research, and formal                  interviews with relevant government and non-government agencies.                                                                                                                                                                                This research is important because the harsh recent history of                  Guatemalan Indians (involvement in local fighting, occupation by                the National army, influence by religious missionaries) is a                    common experience in peasant communities, where a large portion                 of the world's population lives.  Increasing our understanding                  how these communities react to such pressures will help us cope                 with these changes.",
