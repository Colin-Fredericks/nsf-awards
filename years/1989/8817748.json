 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program of Dr. Kenneth J. Shea will be supported                  by the Organic Synthesis Program in the Department of Chemistry                 at the University of California at Irvine.  The principal                       investigator will investigate the chemical and physical                         properties of the carbon-carbon double bond, the so-called                      olefinic group, under structural conditions that will distort                   the unsaturated linkage under geometrically controlled, well                    defined conditions.  The changes in properties will be utilized                 to develop new methods of synthesizing complex structures.                                                                                                      The carbon-carbon double bond is perhaps the most ubiquitous                    functional group in organic chemistry.  The chemical and                        spectroscopic properties of this functional group may be                        significantly modified by twisting the double bond out of                       coplanarity.  This project involves the synthesis of molecules                  that contain twisted carbon-carbon double bonds.  The synthetic                 effort makes available molecules that permit study of how the                   chemical and spectroscopic properties of carbon-carbon double                   bonds respond to twisting.  One particularly interesting                        prospect is to identify reaction manifolds that may be                          particularly sensitive to specific molecular deformations.  It                  is also the intention to utilize molecules with twisted double                  bonds as key intermediates in the synthesis of stereochemically                 complex natural products.",
