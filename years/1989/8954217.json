 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has been designed for 30 participants representing                 minority high school students from rural areas of North Carolina.               It grew out of the realization that in many rural areas of our                  nation, particularly the Southern states with low educational                   budgets, and specifically in North Carolina, there may be few (2-5)             minority students in a science class, and the budgets of these                  schools do not permit the kind of scientific and technical                      experiences that would motivate these students to careers in science            and engineering, regardless of their potential.  Whereas urban                  students can participate in special Saturday or after-school                    activities, for rural minority science students, their best                     opportunity comes through Institute experiences such as proposed in             this proposal.                                                                                                                                                  Specifically, several objectives have been proposed:  (1) to                    identify and recruit thirty (30) minority (black) high school                   students in North Carolina who possess the attributes and academic              potential for pursuing a career in the sciences and engineering; (2)            to prepare the targeted students to enter a four-year college, and to           pursue a course of study that will lead to entry into a science or              engineering career by providing the courses in the basic sciences and           mathematics; (3) to provide role models and career counseling by                bringing speakers on campus; (4) to stimulate interest in the study             of science and engineering by providing \"hands-on\" laboratory                   experiences, computer workshops, and field trips; and (5) to provide            for the targeted students, an opportunity to explore options                    available to them in science and engineering, by providing field                trips and workshops.                                                                                                                                            Plans are described for a six-weeks program, with M T Th F being                devoted to classroom work, W to seminars and field trips, and Sa and            Su devoted to cultural awareness experiences.                                                                                                                   One weakness of the proposal is the lack of involvement of business             and industry in providing financial support and opportunities for               cultural awareness experiences and industrial trips.  No letters of             support were found.  However, the similarity of the problem in many             rural areas could make this a \"model.\"",
