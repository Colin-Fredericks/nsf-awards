 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of eleven US scientists in a                  joint seminar with Taiwan on phytochemical ecology (to include                  allelochemicals, mycotoxins, and insect pheromones and allomones)               and its relevance to agriculture and human health.                                                                                                              Plant allelochemicals are secondary plant metabolites that play an              important role in plant-plant, plant-microorganism, and                         plant-insect interaction, both beneficially and detrimentally.                  Allelopathic chemicals also act as important ecological factors                 which influence plant dominance, succession, climax vegetation, and             crop productivity.  Mycotoxins, another focus of this conference,               are a variety of highly toxic, secondary metabolites produced by                fungi.  Mycotoxins have been recognized as an important class of                hazardous substances in the human food chain.  Pheromones are                   semiochemicals produced by an animal to communicate with another                individual of the same species.  These compounds play a significant             role in agriculture as population regulators. This symposium will               discuss research in these areas and investigate opportunities for               collaborative research.",
