 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most striking phenomena in the contemporary legal               world is the shift toward holding group entities such as                        corporations responsible for harm.  Legal and social changes have               produced a gradual movement away from individual responsibility                 for injuries toward a collective source of responsibility--the                  organization.  Today business corporations are expected to                      provide compensation for injuries that in earlier times would                   have been attributed to individuals or to fate.  Despite a good                 deal of legal scholarship on the shift toward holding businesses                culpable for harms, little systematic work has been done on lay                 views of corporate responsibility.  Basic knowledge about public                views is critical because public attitudes influence substantive                law and legal procedure in a variety of ways and likely also                    affect the behavior of corporations.                                                                                                                            This research is intended to provide the first systematic account               of lay views of corporate responsibility for wrongdoing.  A                     series of interrelated studies employing multiple methods will be               conducted to examine why people hold corporations responsible.                  The first approach is a telephone survey of a random sample of                  450 residents from a single mid-Atlantic state.  The survey will                provide a profile of the content, structure, and individual                     determinants of general attitudes toward corporate wrongdoing.                  The second approach is an interview study of jurors who have                    participated in civil trials with corporations or businesses as                 parties.  Comparisons of interview and public opinion data will                 show whether jurors who decide issues of corporate responsibility               within a rich and detailed legal setting reflect the same                       concerns and attitudinal structures of survey respondents.  A                   final set of studies uses the experimental method of mock jury                  simulation to examine factors affecting judgments of corporate                  responsibility for wrongdoing.  These experiments will test the                 impact of financial resources and identity (individual versus                   type of corporation) of the defendant on judgments of wrongdoing.                                                                                               The project is designed to provide convergent data on the key                   factors that lead the public to hold corporations responsible for               harmdoing.  Often, the failure to take action against corporate                 lawlessness has been justified by claims that the public sees                   such lawlessness as \"morally neutral\" behavior.  This research                  will illuminate the conditions under which citizens support                     intervention in the corporate community.  More generally, the                   research will advance understanding of the problem of collective                responsibility.  Collective responsibility issues arise for a                   variety of groups and organizations such as governments,                        political parties, and voluntary associations.  Furthermore, the                responsibility of groups is an important matter in the criminal                 justice system in cases involving conspiracy, complicity, and                   accessories to crime.",
