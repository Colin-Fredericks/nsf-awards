 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Scott               Halle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to conduct                   collaborative research with Dr. Takayoshi Kobayashi at the                      University of Tokyo.  They will investigate the Ultrafast Nonlinear             Optical Properties of Organic Polymers using femtosecond coherent               transient spectroscopy (FCTS).                                                                                                                                  Organic semiconductors would prove useful in optical signal                     processing were their optical properties, such as index of                      refraction, optical coefficients, and response times, sufficiently              nonlinear.   However, the nature of the nonlinearities for organic              semiconductors has yet been little investigated, partially because              the wavelengths of the femtosecond lasers ordinarily used for                   these studies are inappropriate for the organic semiconductors.                 The FCTS technique, however, which was developed by the Japanese                collaborator, is suitable for use with the organic materials.",
