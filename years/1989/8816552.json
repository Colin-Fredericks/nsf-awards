 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, part of the Experimental Physical Chemistry                      Program, is designed to study the spectroscopy and dynamics of                  simple prototypical molecules near their dissociation                           thresholds.  The object of this study is to understand the                      interaction of the variety of molecular vibrations and                          rotations as a molecule proceeds along the path to dissociation.                                                                                                Fully state-resolved experiments will be done to observe the                    spectra of molecules at the threshold of dissociation, to                       measure dissociation rates for individual quantum states and to                 map the release of energy and angular momentum among product                    degrees of freedom.  An aim of the study is to establish the                    extent of coupling between vibrational and rotational degrees                   of freedom as a molecule proceeds along the reaction coordinate                 to dissociation products.  The data obtained should provide a                   strong test of alternative dynamical models of unimolecular                     reactions.  Ab-initio potential surfaces will be used with                      state-of-the-art dynamical methods to compare theory and                        experiment which provide complete energy state spectral                         resolution.",
