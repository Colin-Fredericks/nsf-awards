 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to characterize mechanisms of                  photoregulation of chlorophyll a/b binding protein (Cab) genes of               pea.  These genes are located in the nucleus, but encode proteins               which form complexes with chlorophyll and act as light harvesting               antennae in chloroplasts.  The experimental plan involves                       measurement of the phytochrome responses of individual Cab genes,               as mRNA accumulation, in response to red light induction signals                which differ by a factor of 10,000.  A similar approach will be                 used to study the potential regulatory role of chlorophyll,                     chlorophyll precursors and postulated, but undefined 'factors' in               the expression of Cab genes.  Methods will also be developed for                comparison of light effects on the transcriptional activity of                  different genes in nuclei from etiolated and greening seedlings.                This proposal approaches the phenomenon of photocontrol from a                  different perspective than studies of gene promoter structure,                  and should be complementary to such studies in definition of the                underlying molecular mechanisms.",
