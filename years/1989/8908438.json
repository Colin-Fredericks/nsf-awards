 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1978 China's leaders have taken steps to expand the role of               markets in allocating resources.  These steps were motivated by                 problems of misallocation and inefficiency arising under                        planning.  Despite general agreement within China about the                     disadvantages of purely administrative allocation,  however,                    views regarding the extent to which markets should replace                      planning vary.  According to one school of thought,  markets                    should play only a supplementary role.  That is,  planning should               still allocate and guide most important economic resources,                     while markets serve to allocate minor,  diverse products and to                 reallocate planned products.  Another school proposes to do away                with planned allocation and limit planning to indirect measures                 that influence markets.  This second view envisions an economic                 system akin to \"market socialism\" where the market,  not                        planning,  guides resource allocation.                                                                                                                          The proposed research addresses questions about plan and market                 raised by China's recent reform experience.  First,  it will                    examine theoretically the operation of a mixed system of plan and               market such as that found in China.  Using a general equilibrium-               type approach,  the theoretical analysis will examine the                       conditions under which  plan and market can coexist in a                        complementary fashion,  and factors that would cause either plan                or market to dominate.  Such factors include transactions costs                 or economies,  plan evasion,  monopolistic state commerce,  and                 non-neoclassical behavior by enterprises.  Second,  the research                will analyze empirically plan and market for farm products in                   China,  testing hypotheses generated by the theoretical analysis.               An important component of the empirical work was to have been                   data collection,  including a multi-year panel survey of farm                   households in two or three localities in China.  Unfortunately,                 however,  it is no longer feasible to conduct collaborative                     research in China, following the crushing of the Chinese students               in Beijing.   Accordingly,  the empirical analysis will focus                   primarily on survey data previously collected by the principal                  investigator in field work during 1987/88.                                                                                                                      Although curtailed in scope,  this research should still yield                  important theoretical insights and policy- relevant findings for                Chinese development.  In addition,  it should shed light on the                 developmental paths of other centrally planned economies.",
