 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge in contemporary biological oceanography is to                 reconcile the opposing arguments that nutrient regeneration in                  the euphotic zone of the open ocean is highly efficient, while                  at the same time new production is fare greater than previously                 believed.  One hypothesis is that two separate biological                       systems operate side by side: one composed of small microbes                    that regenerate most of the nutrients and contribute little to                  new production and another composed of large phytoplankton                      species that are ever present in background numbers and that                    grow rapidly in response to episodic inputs of nutrients at low                 light levels at the base of the euphotic zone and then sink out                 quickly.  The former system is well studied, but the latter is                  not.  The goal of this research is to study the growth and to                   gauge the role of large phytoplankton species in new production                 at very low irradiance.  The results will provide a basis for                   assessing the potential for large phytoplankton species                         contributing greatly to new production while going unnoticed                    because of the episodic nature of their growth and sinking.",
