 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this PYI grant is to create new                        solidification techniques to manufacture materials with                         improved properties.  This is to be accomplished through a                      fundamental study of the large variety of transport phenomena                   present in solidification processes.  Specifically, research                    will proceed through a thorough investigation of the heat and                   species transport by convection and diffusion in both the                       solid and liquid phases, at the micro and macro scales,                         together with consideration of nucleation, phase-change                         kinetics, and solid mechanics.  Because of their technological                  importance, the research will concentrate on solidification of                  metallic alloys and metal composites.  The numerical modelling                  effort will be supported by an experimental program involving                   novel diagnostic techniques for measuring temperature and                       species concentration.                                                                                                                                          Solidification processes are integral to the manufacture of                     virtually all man-made materials, including metals, polymers,                   ceramics, composites, as well as new electronics, optical, and                  magnetic materials.  Consequently, considerable research                        effort needs to be directed toward the development of                           sophisticated solidification techniques to produce materials                    with precisely controlled shapes, chemistry, and physical                       properties.  Through close collaboration with researchers in                    industry, this PYI award can have a strong impact on present                    manufacturing technologies.",
