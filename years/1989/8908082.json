 "awd_abstract_narration": "A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a doubly stochastic process with an              underlying stochastic process that is not observable, i.e., states are          hidden, but can only be observed through another set of stochastic              processes that produce the observable sequence of symbols.  In this             work, the handwritten script recognition problem is modeled in the              framework of HMM.  For English text, which is the focus of the present          research, the states are identified with the letters of the alphabet,           and the optimum symbols are generated by means of experimental study.           Fifteen features (some old, some new) are used for this task.                                                                                                   Both the first and second order hidden Markov models are used for the           recognition task.  Using the existing statistical knowledge of the              English language as in Cryptography etc., the calculation scheme of the         model parameters are immensely simplified for the first order model.            Extending these results and through an exhaustive dictionary search,            probabilities of the second order model are calculated.  Viterbi                algorithm is used to recognize the single best optimal state sequence,          i.e., sequence of letters consisting the word.  The modification of the         recognition algorithm to accommodate context information is also                researched.  Finally, experimental results for the first and second             order models are provided.",
