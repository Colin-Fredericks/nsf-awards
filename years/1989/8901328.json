 "awd_abstract_narration": "Douglas Bell, a doctoral student working under the direction            of Dr. Ned Johnson at the University of California..Berkeley, is                working on an ambitious study of geographic variation in the                    Western and Glaucous.winged Gulls and a hybrid zone between the                 two.  The Western Gull is an important coastal species ranging                  from the Baja Peninsula north along the Pacific coast to southern               Washington where it gives way to the Glaucous.winged Gull which                 ranges northward to the western most Aleutian Islands; the hybrid               populations occur from northern Oregon through Washington.                      Although hybridization among gull species (genus \u001aLarus\u001a) is often              cited as an example of the process of species formation, the                    actual extent, nature and origin of hybridization among the gulls               is poorly known.  Bell proposes to address three conceptual foci:               1) geographical variation in the parental species, 2) the type of               hybrid zone (is the hybrid zone stable, are hybrids selected                    against, are hybrids favored by selection in an ecologically                    intermediate area of overlap?), and 3) the origin of the hybrid                 zone in a historical context.  The study will involve field work                to collect specimens, to collect data on reproductive success in                hybrid and non.hybrid pairings, on assortative mating and on                    vocalizations, and to make field observations on behavior.                      Characterizations of geographic variation will be made on hybrid                index scores based on plumage color variation and other \"soft\"                  part color variation (iris color, leg color, etc.), on                          statistical analysis of skeletal measurements and at the                        molecular level.  The study of species that are so closely                      related that they still hybridize (albeit on a limited basis)                   provide opportunities for dissecting the genetics and                           evolutionary processes that lead to the origin of species.",
