 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Dr. Jeffrey Broadbent of the University of              Minnesota at St. Paul to conduct collaborative research with Dr.                Yoshiaki Kobayashi of Keio University, Japan for 16 months.  They               will perform research on the Japanese aspects of a comparative study            of how business and labor interests affect the establishment of                 public policy in the U.S., West Germany and Japan.                                                                                                              In this research, questionnaires will be sent to about one hundred              business and labor organizations to ascertain their own resources,              degree of interest in various labor policy issues, and, most                    important, details of any interactions with other organizations                 which were intended to influence specific policy decisions over the             last decade.  Personal interviews will also be conducted.  This data            will be used to determine adversary/ally patterns, and how these                patterns are issue-dependent.  It is expected that an increased                 understanding of the Japanese political process will ensue from these           studies.  The Japanese collaborator's assistance will complement the            Principal Investigator's considerable experience with these issues,             and greatly facilitate this study.",
