 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amniocentesis is the technique which permits diagnostic analysis                of fetal chromosomes.  As currently practiced, it involves four                 separate steps:  ultrasonographic imaging, amniotic tapping, cell               culturing, and chromosomal analysis.  Thus, amniocentesis should                be regarded not as a technology but as a technological system.                  Like many 20th century technological systems, the first phase of                its development--the research phase--was heavily dependent upon                 scientists and scientific advances.  Professor Cowan is                         undertaking with this grant a history of this research phase in                 the development of the technological system known as                            amniocentesis.                                                                                                                                                  Each of the separate steps in the system of amniocentesis was                   developed by specialists in quite different fields (geneticists,                engineers, cytologists, research physicians, clinicians) and                    perfected under different historical constraints, different                     times, in different countries.  The \"research phase\" of the                     history of amniocentesis is thus extremely complex and raises                   significant questions about effective science and technology                    policies.  Further, because amniocentesis is used as a diagnostic               tool which may lead to abortion, the process also entails not                   only the feasibility but also the legality of abortions--a step                 that raises difficult ethical issues as well as attendant                       questions about the ways in which ethical concerns determine the                direction of scientific and technological research.                                                                                                             Under this research grant, Professor Cowan will examine the                     specialized literature and examine archives in genetics,                        engineering, cytology and medicine to trace the development of                  the several components of this technological system.",
