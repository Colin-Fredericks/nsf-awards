 "awd_abstract_narration": "High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques will be                   used to separate from the complex mixture of total organic                      carbon in coastal marine sediments enough of several pure                       individual lipid compounds for carbon isotopic analyses on the                  single compounds.  The geochemical rationale for doing so is                    that more valuable and specific process oriented information                    will be obtained from determinations of 13c/12c ratios and                      ratios 14c activities in individual compounds than from                         measurements on either total organic C or on classes of                         compounds.  The 13c/12c ratios should reveal whether the                        compounds are primarily derived from marine plankton or are                     terrestrially derived, and the 14c activities will reveal when                  they were formed.  The key to the isolation of milligram                        amounts of each compound in purities exceeding 95% is a                         straightforward, nonaqueous, reverse phase HPLC technique which                 has so far been overlooked by environmental chemists.",
