 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago maintains one of                the world's premier mammal collections.  Since 1893, the Museum                 has assembled mammal specimens from nearly every country on                     earth, representing virtually all of the extant families and most               genera.  In terms of size and coverage, the mammal collection of                Field Museum ranks third nationally and fourth in the world.                         This immense resource is used in a wide variety of                         scientific contexts.  Preserved materials are used mainly in                    studies of mammalian evolution, but are also intensively used in                studies of anatomy, archeology, paleontology, physical                          anthropology, veterinary medicine, ecology, biogeography, and                   wildlife management.  The huge geographic and taxonomic range of                the collections attracts use by scientists the world over.                           In order to aid the collection in providing services to the                community of scientists, this project awards funds to (1) verify                and expand an existing computerized catalogue database.  Once                   verified, the database will permit faster, more accurate, and                   more comprehensive information retrieval for the collection's                   many users; (2) tan large skins and house already-cleaned                       skeletal material of African mammals collected in 1928-29.                      Collected for exhibits by the Milwaukee Public Museum and                       containing numerous endangered species that are poorly                          represented in collections, the materials remained uncleaned and                untanned for 55 years, until they were adopted by Field Museum.                 The NSF support will make this collection fully available to the                scientific community.",
