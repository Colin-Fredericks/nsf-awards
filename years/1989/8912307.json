 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Granite Mountain Reserve's (GMR) topographic relief and                     ecotonal location in the eastern Mojave Desert account for an                   exceptionally diverse arid-zone flora and fauna with elements                   from several biogeographic sources.  The area has long attracted                field research, and GMR now supports 19 projects concentrated in                behavior, ecology, physiology, and evolution.                                                                                                                   Present research is constrained by an almost complete lack of                   living and laboratory facilities.  A growing demand for pristine                and protected sites in arid habitats of the southwest, due to                   converging trends of population increase, habitat loss, and                     interest in desertification, further indicates the value of                     establishing a stand-alone field research station at GMR.  This                 project,coupled with matching funds from the University, will                   allow construction of:  1) a basic laboratory with equipment for                shared use,  2) housing for up to 6 researchers,  3) a                          campground for visiting researchers, and  4) utilities for the                  above.  These facilities will allow a broader range of research                 activities, boost efficiency and productivity, and establish GMR                as a cost-effective site for a variety of modern field studies.                                                                                                 The Granite Mountains Reserve is among the most recently                        established of the 26 University of California Natural Reserves,                whose goal is to facilitate education and research of scientists                from all disciplines and institutions.",
