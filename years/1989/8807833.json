 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. James M. Farrar, University of Rochester, is supported                   by a grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to                  study the photodissociation and fragmentation of gas phase                      solvated metal cations.  The examples to be studied involve                     alkaline earth metal ions solvated by either water, ammonia or                  methanol.  From studies of cluster ions of this type, which are                 produced under very high vacuum molecular beam conditions, much                 fundamental information can be obtained regarding the nature of                 ion molecule interactions in condensed phase environments.                                                                                                         In these very elegant experiments, the cluster ions are                      produced by injection of low energy metal ions into a                           supersonic flow of solvent molecules from a pulsed nozzle                       source.  Following mass selection, the cluster ions are                         dissociated by light from a tunable pulsed dye laser, and the                   daughter ions are mass analyzed as a function of the laser                      wavelength.  Optical absorption spectra and product mass                        spectra are used to elucidate structural and dynamical                          properties of the solvated metal cations.                                                                                                                          Specific issues to be investigated during the course of this                 research involve: 1) changes in the absorption spectrum as a                    function of cluster size, 2) evaporation of solvent molecules                   as an energy dissipation mechanism, and 3) the possibility of                   intramolecular electron transfer in large clusters.  The                        experiments will be performed using a tandem time of flight                     mass spectrometer which will be constructed during the term of                  the grant.",
