 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jackson and his associates plan studies on mechanisms of                    acid-base, ionic, and metabolic regulation in reptiles and                      mammals.  The reptile studies derive from past observations on                  the extraordinary anoxic tolerance of the freshwater turtle,                    Chrysemys picta bellii.  Three directions will be pursued.                      First, the increase in plasma catecholamines (epinephrine and                   norepinephrine), that have been recenty observed when turtles are               anoxic and/or acidotic, will be further documented and its                      functional significance and possible contribution to this                       animal's anoxic tolerance will be investigated.  Second, the                    marked increase in plasma calcium concentration in turtles during               anoxia leads us to a broad study of calcium kinetics and hormonal               regulation of calcium metabolism in this species.  He plans to                  compare the responses of the turtle to another reptile that lacks               the turtle's mineral-rich shell.  Third, because his recent                     results have failed to reveal a correlation between blood                       acidosis and anoxic tolerance or anaerobic metabolism he will                   investigate intracellular pH and metabolite control of selected                 tissues during various types of anoxic and acidotic conditions.                 The hypothesis presented in this project, that cellular acidosis                depresses energy metabolism, relates to the final proposed                      project on the heterothermic bat, Eptesicus fuscus.  Preliminary                data suggest a dual pH control strategy in this species during                  torpor at 20 degrees centigrade:  alphastat in the summer, pH-                  stat in the winter.  The principal investigator's objective is to               verify this observation in both blood and cells and evaluate its                relevance to energy conservation of torpid bats.  Overall, the                  goal is an understanding of the mechanisms regulating                           hypometabolic states.",
