 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development, axons grow long distances in the central                    nervous system to contact their specific targets, while in the                  adult, there is little axon growth following a lesion and                       functional recovery is limited.  Immature astrocytes have been                  proposed to be the cellular substrate for axon growth during                    development, and after a lesion to the adult CNS, \"reactive\"                    mature astrocytes are a major cellular component of glial scars                 that have been proposed to block axon growth.  These observations               suggest that the capacity of astrocytes to support and direct                   growth alters during CNS maturation.  The molecular basis                       underlying the ability of astrocytes to support axon growth                     during development, and its modulation during astrocyte                         maturation is unknown.                                                                                                                                          This study is designed to determine if changes in the                           interactions both between astrocytes and neurons; as well as                    between astrocytes and astrocytes, are responsible for the                      inhibition of neurite outgrowth by astrocytes after maturation.                 Dr. Miller will identify molecules involved in the following                    changes observed when astrocytes mature:  (1) Neurite outgrowth                 is reduced on mature astrocytes, (2) Neurons have decreased                     adhesion to mature astrocytes, and (3) Astrocyte/astrocyte                      adhesion increases in mature astrocytes.  In addition, neurite                  growth will be compared in a 3-dimensional matrix of immature or                mature astrocytes, and the perturbation of cell interactions                    involving astrocyte/neuron and astrocyte/astrocyte adhesion in                  this system will be determined.  These studies will provide new                 information on the regulation of axon outgrowth by astrocytes of                the developing and adult CNS.",
