 "awd_abstract_narration": "The visual world contains more information than we can perceive                 in a single glance.  To compensate for this state of affairs, we                make eye and head movements to look at objects of interest, and                 we gradually construct a mental representation of the environment               from these successive views.  Our eyes scan the world by means of               rapid movements, called saccades, that are separated by brief                   periods of time, called fixations, during which the eyes are                    still.  One might logically expect this pattern of eye movement                 activity to produce a terribly disruptive pattern of visual input               for perception, a sequence of stationary, clear images of the                   world, alternating with violent sweeps of information during the                saccades.  Our perceptual experience, of course, does not                       correspond to such an alternating sequence at all.  Rather, it                  consists of clear, continuous, panoramic views of large sections                of the visual environment, with objects remaining stable in                     space.  This mismatch between the nature of the visual input and                the nature of our phenomenal experience is one of the great                     mysteries in the study of perception, a mystery that is still                   largely unsolved.  This research project will investigate the                   characteristics of the memory or memories responsible for                       integrating information across eye movements to yield the                       coherent perception of the visual world that we ordinarily                      experience.  In particular, the research will focus on the                      capacity, time-course, and representational format of these                     memories. People will view visual displays while their eye                      movements are monitored.  When an eye movement is detected, the                 visual display will disappear and the observer's memory for that                display will be assessed.  For example, the observer may indicate               whether a second display is identical to or different from the                  first display, or may attempt to report some particular                         information that was present in the display.  These responses                   will reveal what aspects of the original view are stored in                     memory and maintained across an eye movement.  By varying the                   amount and the visual characteristics of the information in the                 display and by varying the timing and the nature of the memory                  test following the eye movement, the research will reveal how                   much information is retained across eye movements, how long it                  persists in memory, and how detailed is its memory                              representation.                                                                                                                                                 The perception of a stable and continuous visual environment                    across changes in eye position has puzzled and intrigued                        scientists for over a century.  The research will allow us to                   make progress in solving this puzzle. In addition, the research                 will provide important information about spatial representation                 and spatial cognition in general, with possible relevance to the                study of reading and to the study of oculomotor disorders that                  are sometimes accompanied by perceptual instability.",
