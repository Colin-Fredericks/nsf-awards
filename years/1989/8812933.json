 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many theories of legal behavior and legal processes include                     implicit or explicit assumptions about how people come to be                    involved with the law or about the needs that legal institutions                fulfill.  Because disputed claims are the raw material of the                   civil justice system, an understanding of the claiming process                  goes to the heart of who uses the legal system, under what                      circumstances, for what purposes, and with what consequences.                   One of the truisms in the study of law and society is that there                are enormous numbers of potential claims that are never pursued.                Despite the importance of claiming behavior for legal theory and                policy, relatively little empirical work has addressed the topic                since existing data lack the time-based comparisons needed for                  definitive tests of what causes some people to claim compensation               while other similarly injured people do not.                                                                                                                    The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recently                     awarded a grant to the Institute for Civil Justice at RAND for a                study of accidental injury compensation that provides an                        opportunity to test some of these issues.  Drs. Hensler and Lind                will conduct a panel study that will be coordinated with the DHHS               survey.  They will reinterview 400 of the respondents in the DHHS               survey in order to gather pre-claim and post-claim measures of a                number of factors that might drive claiming behavior.  A control                group of 100 injured individuals will be interviewed a single                   time to test for reactivity effects.  By using the approach of                  reinterviewing a sample of injured individuals over time, it will               be possible to determine the sequence of events such as injury                  progression, loss accrual, and acquisition of knowledge about the               legal process that leads to claiming.  Several models of claiming               behavior will be tested including a fault-responsibility-equity                 model, economic models, and a procedural model.  The results of                 the analyses will be used to develop more integrative theories of               claiming.                                                                                                                                                       The DHHS study will provide a nationally representative and rich                database on the characteristics and economic and social                         consequences of injuries using a cross-sectional approach.  This                grant, using the panel study approach, will provide opportunities               for comparing the predictive value of a variety of claiming                     models that derive from different disciplinary traditions.  The                 research will significantly improve our basic understanding of                  the dynamics of claiming compensation for injury.  In addition,                 the two databases, which will be archived at the completion of                  the project, will provide a resource for further analytic work.",
