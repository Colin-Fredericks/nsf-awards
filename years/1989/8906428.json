The work of the multidisciplinary                            U.S. team has emphasized the following areas:                                                                                                                     -  mapping of surface fault rupture,                                            -  deploying arrays of instruments to monitor                                      seismicity and to record strong ground shaking                                  from the aftershock sequence,                                                -  examining damaged and collapsed buildings and                                   acquiring drawing for further analysis,                                      -  inspecting seismoscope and accelerograph records                                of the main shock, and large aftershocks,                                    -  visiting the nuclear power plant near Yerevan,                               -  mapping landslides and liquefaction,                                         -  examining the performance of lifelines, and                                  -  determining human and societal behavior in the                                  emergency response and recovery environments.                                                                                                              This research effort should provide important lessons                           for earthquake hazard mitigation in the U.S. as well as                         the U.S.S.R.",
