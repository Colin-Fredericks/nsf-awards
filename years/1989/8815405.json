 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI requests funds to collect volcanic rocks suitable for                   precise dating of 19 fossil floras, chiefly in the region from                  northern Nevada to Washington and central Idaho.  This is                       required to complete a comparative snythesis of vegetation and                  climate during the time 14-12 Ma over the region from eastern                   Washington to the Salton Sea, some 1,700 km (1,000 mi.)                         southward.  All the floras under study record environments                      directly following a major climatic crisis as revealed by                       comparison with floras 16-15 Ma.  The younger floras show a                     drastic reduction or virtual elimination of exotic genera, those                now in eastern US or Asia, a change reflecting a marked decrease                in summer rainfall over the interior.  As a result, most species                in younger floras closely resemble those in modern vegetation in                the western U.S.  However, the change was the greatest over the                 central interior for exotic taxa persisted longer under more                    favorable climate in coastal regions and to the north.  To                      complete this regional synthesis, radiometric dating of volcanic                rocks associated with previously described floras is mandatory so               that those of closely similar age will be compared.  Research                   will improve understanding of how vegetation changes in response                to climate change.",
