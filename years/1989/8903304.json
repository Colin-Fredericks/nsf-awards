 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recently erupting fields of computational geometry and                 algorithmic robotics have demonstrated the essential nature of                  efficient algorithms for problems in combinatorial optimization                 and graph theory.  There are very few geometric algorithms that                 do not have some graph theoretic component, either in their very                structure or in their use of data structures.                                        The main thrust of this research is to explore geometric                   problems that arise in applications to robotics and computer                    vision, and bring to these problems the many tools of graph                     theory.  In some cases, new problems need to be formulated and                  solved; in other cases, the methods currently being used will be                investigated to see if there are possible improvements that may                 come from the application of graph theoretic concepts and                       algorithms.  The basic goal is to prove (worse-case) bounds on                  the computational complexity of problems, either by producing an                efficient algorithm if one exists, or by proving a \"lower bound\"                such as NP-hardness. In cases of NP-hard problems, the goal is to               devise efficient heuristic algorithms, if possible with provably                good effectiveness.                                                                  In particular, the investigation will include important                    variations on shortest path and shortest cycle problems in                      robotics, \"beautification\" problems in geometric modelling,                     visibility questions that arise in graphics and computational                   geometry, and image matching problems that arise in computer                    vision.                                                                              //",
