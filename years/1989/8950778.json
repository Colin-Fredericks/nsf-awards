 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first major change that has occurred in the teaching of organic             chemistry laboratory in decades has been the introduction of the                microscale laboratory technique.  The apparatus is down sized and               experiments are carried out on a scale one-tenth to one-thousandth of           the scale previously employed.  The microscale technique is an entirely         new way of doing the undergraduate organic chemistry laboratory:                everything on a very small scale.  Among the many advantages of this            technique is a strong instrumental focus, infrared spectrometry and gas         chromatography.  Switching from the traditional approach to the                 microscale technique cannot be accomplished without ready access to             these important instrumental techniques.  Along with using the infrared         spectrometer and the GC for product characterization in most of their           experimental work, the students learn the theory behind these two               important instrumental techniques.                                                                                                                              The institution is matching the grant with an equal amount of funds.",
