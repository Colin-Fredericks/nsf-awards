 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will design and implement user interface systems for               scientific and engineering computation, with special emphasis on the            parallel computing environment.  The work involves activity in several          areas: graphical interaction and visualization, computation                     strategies, and domain specific research in computational fluid                 dynamics.  The latter area serves as the \"test bed\" for the interface           research. The overall objective is to provide the engineer and                  scientist with high performances, interactive computation environments          that allow prototyping exploration (\"what if?\" experimentation) by              combining interactive graphics, high performance (parallel)                     computation, with an intelligent interface that allows problem input            in physical, rather than programmatic expression.                                                                                                               Research on the user interface will enhance our present version by              addition of such features as detection of problem based parallelism             (such as embodied in singular perturbation problems).  The interactive          graphics work will concentrate on constraint based object-oriented              systems.  Emphasis is to be placed on the Model-View-Controller                 paradigm as a basis for the user's interaction with his prototype               model to effect computational steering.  The computation strategies             research is concentrating on new models for parallel computing, such            as object-oriented parallel computation, and the development of new             parallel computation library modules to support engineering                     computation.  The domain specific (computational fluid dynamics, or             CFD) work is directed at parallel computing for nonlinear dynamics              problems (such as Lagrangian turbulence dynamics), and the integration          into interactive environments for CFD numerical exploration.                                                                                                    This research is as continuation of on-going efforts in the Rutgers             CAIP* Parallel Computing Lab, and is proposed as a joint NSF-CAIP               program.                                                                                                                                                        *CAIP (Center for Computer Aids for Industrial Productivity).",
