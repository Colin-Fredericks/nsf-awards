 "awd_abstract_narration": "Striga asiatica (witchweed) is a major parasite on corn, Sorghum,               millet and rice. This parasitic angiosperm attaches to the host                 root and invades the host vascular system through a specialized                 organ termed a haustorium. The development of this unique                       structure by the parasite is initiated in response to a specific                chemical signal from the host. An inducer of Striga haustorial                  development has been isolated from Sorghum and identified as 2,6-               dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone (2,6-DMBQ). Dr. Timko proposes to                      examine the biochemical and molecular genetic mechanisms involved               in haustorial induction and development. Using a combination of                 in vivo and in vitro approaches he has begun to define the                      changes in the transcriptional and translational activities of                  Striga radicles following induction of haustorial formation by                  2,6-DMBQ. He will construct cDNA libraries from poly(A)+ RNA                    isolated from uninduced radicles, induced radicles, and mature                  haustoria. By differential screening procedures he will identify                differentially expressed gene products. These cDNAs will be                     structurally characterized and the nature of their biochemical                  factors affecting the development of attachment competency and                  intrusive growth on host plants. These studies will provide the                 basis for the future stages of its development.                                 %%%                                                                             The Striga-host interaction offers an unique opportunity to study               the molecular control of plant developmental processes as well as               the molecular aspects of plant-pathogen interactions. An                        understanding of the early events of Striga-host interactions can               lead to the development of control methods for Striga and other                 root parasites.",
