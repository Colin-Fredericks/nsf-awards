 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of a collaborative project by two well                   known theorists, Drs. Reinganum and Wilde, who have been working                on economic analyses of law enforcement and regulatory                          compliance.  Three topics will be examined.  The first is an                    extension of the investigators' work on tax compliance.                         Corruption will be introduced into the investigators' prior work                by allowing for the possibility of tax auditors accepting bribes                in exchange for not reporting tax evasion revealed by an audit.                 Second, a model will be developed which explains when firms will                correctly reveal information about new chemical products they                   produce, and optimal auditing ruling by the EPA in light of this.               The model will incorporate how the audit policy of the EPA                      affects the firm's choice of chemicals to manufacture and the                   nature of the information supplied to the EPA.  Third, a theory                 of optimal nonmonetary sanctions will be developed where crime                  (e.g. armed robbery) may increase the likelihood that some other                crime (e.g. murder) will be committed.  This component of the                   research will offer normative and positive models of law                        enforcement.                                                                                                                                                    Economic considerations have an important influence on compliance               with the law and, thus, on strategies for regulation and law                    enforcement.  Drs. Reinganum and Wilde's work is among the best                 in trying to balance the realities of enforcement with the                      simplification necessary for rigorous economic analysis.  The                   research promises to further illuminate the causes and underlying               dynamics of compliance and thus is of substantial scientific                    significance.",
