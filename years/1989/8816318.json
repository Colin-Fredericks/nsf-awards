 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Prof. William E. Lands of the University                 of Illinois at Chicago to collaborate over a period of two years with           Prof. Tomohito Hamazaki of the Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical Univ-          ersity and Professor Harumi Okuyama of the Nagoya City University,              both in Japan.  They will investigate whether or not analysis of the            fatty acid composition of blood lipid can provide a reliable index of           a person's tendency to ingest certain types of polyunsaturated fatty            acids.  Six different types of blood lipids, each of which responds             at a different rate to changes in diet, are accessible for study, and           the researchers will attempt to establish a definite relationship               between the composition of an individual's diet and the composition             of the various blood lipids.                                                                                                                                    The purpose of this research is to obtain data on blood lipid                   composition as a function of diet, and to this end groups of Japanese,          among whom there is a wide range of fat intake, will be given                   selected diets containing various ratios of fish and fat, various               types of fat, or a special diet developed at the University of                  Illinois at Chicago.  These controlled diet studies will allow                  quantification of the relationship of blood lipid composition to                diet, making it possible eventually to eliminate the vagaries of                dietary recall from diagnosis of individual dietary problems.                   Collaborative interactive teams of biochemists and nutritionists have           been formed at each university involved with this project.  These               workers will share common techniques, reagents, and internal standards          to ensure comparability of the data obtained.  Collaboration with               Japanese workers is essential to realize the full advantage of the              variety found in the Japanese diet.  This work has major implications           in the realm of dietary diagnosis and health improvement and                    maintenance.",
