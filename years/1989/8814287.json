 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California Riverside Nematode Collection                 (UCRNC) is one of the largest museums of economically important                 plant parasitic nematodes in the world, with 13,000 vials of                    bulked specimens and nearly 150,000 specimens mounted on 32,000                 slides for microscopic examination.  The collection is used by                  scientists from throughout the world, studying nematodes for                    research in many disciplines including agriculture, ecology,                    genetics, taxonomy, evolution, and invertebrate zoology.  The                   collection conserves original specimens from descriptions of new                species, voucher specimens as a record of previous research, and                specimens from worldwide surveys which provide insight into the                 diversity of nematodes.  Since nematodes are one of the most                    abundant and diverse multicellular organisms, since they                        frequently serve as a convenient model for research in                          fundamental biology, and since in some developing countries                     plant parasitic forms are the limiting factor in agriculture,                   efficient museum resources are essential.                                            Previous NSF support provided convenient accessible                        fireproof storage and reliable updating of records through                      computerization of UCRNC, but funding was only adequate for                     storage and updating of records for two-thirds of the collection.               The present proposal is to extend these improvements to the                     remainder of the collection and allow secure storage which will                 accommodate modest growth (3000 additional slides).                             Computerization of records will not only allow quick access of                  available material but will provide for careful monitoring of                   loaned specimens and cross-indexing according to species, host,                 geographical area, preparation technique, date of collection or                 preparation, taxonomic category, literature reference and other                 parameters.  Computerization of UCRNC will also provide a model                 for efficient cataloguing of other museums.  A common format for                similar nematology collections will allow eventual storage of                   records of several collections on a single computer for                         widespread accessibility of the combined data.",
