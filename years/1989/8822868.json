 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to provide support for conduct of an international             symposium on processes governing the movement and fate of contaminants          in the subsurface environment at Stanford University from July 24 to            26, 1989.  The purpose of the symposium is to bring together engineers          and scientists who are at the forefront of groundwater research to              assess the current state of knowledge and identify research needs.              Symposium topics have been made very specific so that the participants          can direct their attention to some of the most important aspects of             this difficult problem.                                                                                                                                         Subsurface contamination is one of the major current environmental              problems and enormous expenditures are being made to solve this                 complex problem in the face of limited knowledge regarding processes            that determine the manner by which pollutions are diffused and                  dispersed in groundwater aquifers.  Results of this conference are              expected to be utilized in planning of responsive measures and in               identifying research needs.  This conference is also being supported            by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Environmental Protection             Agency.",
