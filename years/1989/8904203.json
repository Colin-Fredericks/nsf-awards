 "awd_abstract_narration": "Classifier systems learn by means of a market economy of                        instructions (classifiers) and data (messages).  The system is                  computationally parallel since all classifiers may be applied to                all messages simultaneously.  Classifier systems discover by                    means of a genetic algorithm which creates promising new                        classifiers from successful ones.  This genetic procedure                       conducts a parallel search for the building blocks of problem                   solutions.  Classifier systems already exhibit successful                       learning and discovery, including the emergence and stability of                both multilevel default hierarchies and chains of classifiers                   relevant to means of software packages developed for expressing                 problematic environments and for formulating classifier programs.               The project will study the different roles of strength (wealth),                the roles of generality and specificity in hierarchies and                      classifier reproduction, and the emergence of building blocks.                  Adaptive systems which develop their own goals will also be                     covered.  Our computer experiments are guided by a theory of                    adaptation.  The fundamental theorem characterizes the rate at                  which the genetic algorithm samples the building blocks of useful               models of the environment.  We will extend this theorem to cover                the discovery of regularities in rapidly changing environments.",
