 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science Networks is a three-year project which will enlarge                     the scientific competence of rural elementary teachers.                         Through a series of workshops during three academic years and                   two summer institutes of five weeks each, Pittsburg State                       University (KS.) scientists and science educators will                          instruct teachers in order to increase their knowledge of                       natural science, to serve as leaders for the in-service                         training of an additional 75 teachers, and to equip them to                     motivate their students toward careers in science.                                                                                                              Throughout the project, highly regarded curricular materials                    will form the basis of the workshops and institutes, and the                    utilization of nature centers, environmental studies areas,                     and ecological systems will provide opportunities for                           engaging students in experiential science instruction.                                                                                                          Pittsburg State University is contributing in cost-sharing an                   amount that is equal to 77% of the NSF award.",
