 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcium plays an integral role in the metabolism, growth and                 development of plants and plant cells; however, our understanding               of this important regulator has lagged behind similar insights in               animal systems.  A workshop will be organized to evaluate the                   methodologies commonly used to investigate calcium-mediated                     systems, responses and processes.  This workshop will focus                     on the various approaches as they may be applied to plant tissues               or cells and will consider the special problems which attend the                study of calcium in plant cells.  Thus, the principle objectives                of the workshop are to expand the base of knowledge fundamental                 to the study of calcium in plants; to critically evaluate the                   currently available methods,; and to focus on the developing new                technologies which may provide insight into the molecular                       mechanisms of calcium action in plants.                                            This workshop will provide an opportunity for interaction                    between beginning and experienced investigators and will provide                a forum for the critical evaluation of the methods available to                 investigate the role of calcium in plant cells.  The exchange of                information provided by this workshop should substantially                      enhance the knowledge base for future research directed toward                  understanding the role of calcium in plant metabolism, growth,                  and development.",
