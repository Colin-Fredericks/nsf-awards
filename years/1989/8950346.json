 "awd_abstract_narration": "High school teachers and industry scientists, engineers, and                    mathematicians, with the support of UCLA and other university                   professors, will work together to produce Teaching Resource Units which         will teach technical topics, demonstrate applications of the material in        real world situations, and provide information on related career                opportunities.  The units will be suitable for both disabled and non-           disabled students and will be specifically designed to demonstrate the          feasibility of integrating disabled students into regular science,              mathematics, and computer classes.   At least one disabled person from          industry will be included on each TRU team.  TRU topics will be                 carefully selected to fit well into typical high school curricula.                                                                                              After initial preparation of each unit, it will be taught by the teacher        members of the team at a summer science camp which will include both            disabled and non-disabled students.  These students will be videotaped          during this summer camp, and the tapes will be included as part of the          Teaching Resource Unit.                                                         Completed TRUs will be distributed widely, both through normal                  educational channels and through organizations particularly concerned           with the disabled.                                                                                                                                              Cost sharing by the partners will total 99% of the NSF funding.",
