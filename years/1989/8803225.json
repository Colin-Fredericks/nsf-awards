 "awd_abstract_narration": "A four-year program of research is being undertaken to                     realize the analytic potential of two extraordinary education                   datasets: High School and Beyond and the National Educational                   Longitudinal Study of 1988. Taken together, these two datasets                  constitute the most extensive, richest body of information we                   have on the educational status of America's youth in relation to                America's secondary schools. The scheduled program of research is               intended to advance the social science use of this information                  through an interrelated set of substantive and methodological                   investigations which will, in a comparable and integral                         fashion, examine the learning experiences of high school seniors                graduating in the years 1972, 1980, 1982, 1988, and 1992.                            The conceptual framework for the research is posited as an                 interactive system in which students' learning experiences and                  outcomes are affected by a web of reciprocal relationships among                the educational activities of teachers, the student composition                 and social organization of classrooms, the administrative                       policies and structures of high schools, and the relationships of               the parental community to both students and teachers. Attempts to               disentangle strands of the web and uncover underlying processes                 will be made by use of sophisticated statistical modeling                       procedures which hold the promise of producing substantive gains                of a basic social scientific kind as well as improving the                      metrics available for policy-related studies of formal schooling.                    The research includes provisions for devising and                          implementing a database management system that will organize and                widen access to existing and forthcoming educational longitudinal               datasets, improve access to and management of the growing body of               statistical findings based upon longitudinal educational surveys,               gain bibliographic control over publications related to data                    derived from such surveys, and make all of this available to                    future users of the data in media appropriate to modern computing               environments. Funding for the research is being furnished by the                Department of Education in addition to the National Science                     Foundation.",
