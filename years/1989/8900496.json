Dr. Holm-Hansen proposes to spend two months primarily analyzing data           he and Dr. Sakshaug have acquired in numerous cruises in both polar             regions during the past seven years, as well as data both have                  produced in the laboratory which is essential to interpreting their             field data.  Their computerized data bases consist of simultaneously            acquired information on physical-biological-optical characteristics             in vertical profiles in the upper 200 m of the water column.  The               investigators wish to model the dynamic interaction between growth              and physiology of the phytoplankton and the mean irradiance to which            the cells are exposed as influenced by vertical mixing processes.               They shall interpret data within the general framework of the                   Critical Depth hypothesis first described by Sverdrup in 1953,                  expecting that their large data base should provide a more realistic            formulation of this concept.",
