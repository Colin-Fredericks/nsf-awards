 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is great interest in the properties of semiconductor strained-            layer superlattices but their practical application is hampered by              phenomena involving both point and line defects.  In this study the             most common line defects, i. e., misfit dislocations, which are                 concomitant with the misfit strain of the structures of interest, will          be used to remove the point defects from the region where the desired           devices are to be grown.  This will be accomplished  with a combination         of optically induced dislocation glide and optically induced                    dislocation climb through the lithographic masks used in the present            art to form the devices.  The net effect is to getter the point defects         at the threading portions of the misfit dislocations after these have           been induced to glide to the outer boundaries of the device.  As a              final solution, the threading dislocations will be used to nucleate             dissolution in an etching process to provide trench isolation between           the devices.  The first target of this process will be the \"DX center,\"         which is the major impediment to economically viable AlGaAs HEMT                devices, and which has already been found to getter on threading                dislocations under optical excitation.",
