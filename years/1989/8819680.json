 "awd_abstract_narration": "Side chain polymer and elastomer liquid crystals are new classes                of materials which uniquely combine two competing phenomena;                    isotropic fluctuations of polymers and anisotropic orientational                and translational order fluctuations of liquid crystals.  They                  exhibit novel nematic liquid crystalline structures and phase                   transitions, and offer a new perspective on the unsolved nematic-               smectic-A problem.  A change in the number of spatial dimensions                explored by the polymer chain should occur with the establishment               of smectic order in these systems accompanied by an interesting                 cross-over behavior among four relevent length scales.  This                    provides an opportunity to experimentally study the statistical                 mechanics of a random coil in two dimensions.                                                                                                                   The synthesis and preliminary studies in this area have been                    performed mostly outside the United States.  They propose here a                combination of two powerful techniques, high-resolution x-ray                   diffraction and small-angle neutron scattering, to study subtle                 aspects of the structure and critical phenomena in these                        materials.  They proposed research should help bring this                       interesting area into the main stream of condensed matter                       research in this country.",
