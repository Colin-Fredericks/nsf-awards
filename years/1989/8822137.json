 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of a research agenda in applied dynamic                   macroeconomics.  Several broad problems are investigated:  The                  first topic concerns the dynamic co-movements between average                   productivity,  hours worked and output.  The second centers on                  the role of aggregate fiscal policy in postwar US business                      cycles.  The third category focuses on the interaction between                  growth and business cycles in modern industrialized economies.                  The fourth broad area continues the investigator's long-standing                research on the structural determinants of inventories of                       finished goods.  The total research effort involves both                        theoretical model development and analysis.  The latter will be                 conducted using aggregate and industry specific postwar US time                 series data.  The several projects are united by their                          methodology, which is to use dynamic general equilibrium theory                 to generate time series models which are tightly parameterized                  and which are estimated using the generalized method of moments.                The linkage between dynamic theory and dynamic econometrics                     offers the possibility of evaluating competing theories of                      trends.",
