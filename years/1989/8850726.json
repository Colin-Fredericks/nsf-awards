 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, Visual Geometry, is producing new, coordinated,                   multi-media geometry materials: computer-animated videotapes of                 three-dimensional figures for high quality visual images,                       associated workbooks for constructing and investigating three-                  dimensional figures, and a microcomputer program for interactive                study of related two-dimensional geometry concepts.  The                        Geometer's Sketchpad will be a general purpose, two-dimensional                 drawing program designed for constructing and manipulating                      geometric figures.  It will be useful with both standard geometry               materials and with the units produced by this project.                                                                                                          The materials are being designed to fit into the standard high                  school curriculum, and will be flexible enough to be used by an                 entire class, small groups of students, or even for individual                  study.  The materials are being done in a way to be appealing to                people who wish to improve their visual geometry skills, even if                they are not taking a geometry course.  The entire program is                   being thoroughly and broadly tested.  Additional videotapes to                  familiarize teachers wit the uses of the materials will also be                 made.  There are plans for broad dissemination; the project staff               will also take advantage of the growing market in home-study                    video.                                                                                                                                                          In a pilot project, the proposers have set up a microcomputer                   system to produce professional quality video animation of three-                dimensional geometry concepts.  In addition to the materials                    produced by the project, the staff will be able to provide                      software and information to others who wish to work with the                    media of animated videotapes and videodiscs.//",
