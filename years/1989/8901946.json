 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalyst deactivation is an important, sometimes controlling,                   factor in many processed invloving catalytic chemical                           transformations.  There are three major categories of                           deactivation:                                                                        (1)  Poisoning-the loss of activity by selective                                     chemisorption of strongly bound impurties on the                                surface                                                                    (2)  Coking or fouling-the loss of activity by the for                               the formation of carbonaceous residues                                     (3)  sintering-the loss of activity by agglomeration                                 producing loss of active surface area.                                                                                                                Often more than one of thes mechanisms can act simultaneoulsy,                  particularly for reactions conducted at severe condition and                    with complex feed mixtures.  This research project focusses on                  the congruent effects of catalyst decay by chemical poisoning                   and by coke formation, processes (1) and (2) above.                                                                                                             The PI plans both theoretical analysis and experimental                         verification of the effects of these two processes on the                       dynamics of fixed bed catlystic the modification of                             diffusional limitations on rector performance by catalyst                       deactivation, both with respect to the influence on themain                     reaction considered as well as the rate of deactivation                         itself.  Individual modes of deactivation as well as their                      combination will be studied.",
