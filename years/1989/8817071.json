 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the thioredoxin system of the                         filamentous cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp., strains 7119 and                      7120.  Anabaena is a good model for higher plants, since like                   spinach chloroplasts, they contain two dissimilar                               thioredoxins.  The genes for both Anabaena thioredoxins have                    been cloned and substantial amounts of protein are in hand.                     The differences in redox potentials and biological activity                     in vitro will be determined and compared with those of the                      chloroplast thioredoxins.  The relative amounts of these                        thioredoxins in Anabaena under different growth conditions                      will be determined.  Anti-thioredoxin antibodies will be used                   to detect and quantitiate the proteins in crude extracts                        using Western blotting.  Inactivation of these genes in                         Anabaena will be investigated in collaboration with J. Elhai                    at Michigan State University.  This work should provide basic                   information on the in vivo role of thioredoxins in                              photosynthetic organisms.                                                                                                                                       The proteins being studied are important in the regulation of                   starch and sucrose synthesis in photosynthetic organisms.                       Plant productivity is directly dependent on the distribution                    of these products of photosynthesis.//",
