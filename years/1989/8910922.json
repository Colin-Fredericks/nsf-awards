 "awd_abstract_narration": "This facility will be used for research that necessitates growing               higher plants under controlled environmental conditions in                      sunlight.  A large component of the usage consists of maintaining               transformed plants under conditions in which they can flower and                produce seed as rapidly as possible.  This research involves                    understanding gene regulation by developmental factors and by                   environmental factors.  A second major component of the usage is                to maintain and propagate mutant lines used in research on                      gibberellin metabolism and light regulation of gene expression.                 The final major usage is to produce large quantities of normal                  plant material from many different species for use in research                  into tissue specific gene expression in tobacco, developmentally                regulated gene expression in soybean and in Arabidopsis, the                    light-harvesting components of photosynthesis in a number of                    different species, gibberellin metabolism in maize and sunflower,               and assessing the nitrogen fixing ability of alfalfa and                        fast-growing nitrogen fixing trees like Casuarina.  Other usage                 includes the study of gene expression in response to ethylene and               wounding, electrophysiological controls of plant cell plasma                    membranes, particularly in regulation of stomata, and the study                 of the phytoalexin response in rice.",
