 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metabolic Pathway Engineering (MPE), defined as the design, analysis,           and construction of biochemical pathways, is an emerging technology with        broad implications for the production of chemicals and the degradation          of toxic compounds.  MPE involves adding genetic material to a host             organism to modify an existing pathway or to create a new one.  The             objective of this project is to directly address key problems associated        with MPE by constructing a new pathway in E. coli.  The model pathway           selected for this research is the conversion of glycerol to 1,3 -               propanediol as carried out by Klebsiella pneumoniae.  The first step is         to characterize the carbon flux and intracellular intermediate                  concentrations of K. pneumoniae, as a basis of comparison with the              engineered E. coli.  The final step is to then study the function of the        new pathway in E. coli and investigate its interactions with the host           metabolism.  This work is expected to provide new  insight into MPE and         to provide a well characterized model system  for further research.  In         addition, 1,3 - propanediol is a useful chemical intermediate, and it is        possible that this work will lead to improvements in its production.",
