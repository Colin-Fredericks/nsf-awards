 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II                    project is in the general area of analytical and surface                        chemistry and in the subfields of electrochemistry and                          materials chemistry.  The goal of this activity is the                          development of highly dispersed, small particle, supported goal                 electrocatalysts for the reduction of dioxygen in alkaline                      media.  In the preceding Phase I research which was supported                   under NSF grant ISI-8660688, Physical Sciences, Inc.                            demonstrated that the direct electroreduction of dioxygen to                    water was enhanced on the 100 surface of goal.  The company                     further demonstrated that small-particle gold catalysts could                   be fabricated on carbon supports, and that the use of these                     electrocatalysts gave rise to diminished formation of the                       undesired hydrogen peroxide electroreduction product.                                In the present Phase II activity, the previous Phase I                     work is being extended and broadened in scope.  Research tasks                  for the current effort include (1) preparation of highly                        dispersed supported gold electrocatalysts and development of                    corrosion resistant support materials for use in alkaline                       media; (2) tailoring of the gold crystallite structure through                  variation of both particle size and fabrication conditions to                   produce (100) preferentially oriented gold particles; (3)                       determination of the crystallite structure of the gold                          particles using extended x-ray absorption fine structure                        (EXAFS) spectroscopy both in vacuo and in situ in an actual                     operating fuel cell; and (4) measurement of electrode                           performance in a half-cell configuration under realistic                        operating conditions.  The new electrocatalysts derived from                    this research could have broad, technologically important                       applications.",
