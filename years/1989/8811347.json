 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanical power output of a striated muscle will be                        determined by measuring muscle tension as the muscle is subjected               to periodic length change and to stimuli which occur at selected                phases of the length cycle.  The plot of muscle tension against                 length over a cycle forms a loop whose area is the work done by                 or on the muscle for that cycle.  The goals of this project are:                1)  To combine mechanical power measurements from insect wing                   muscles with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption in                  order to measure the efficiency of the muscle in converting                     metabolic to mechanical power, and to determine if the operating                conditions which maximize power output are also those which                     maximize efficiency.  2)  To extend power measurements to muscles               other than insect wing muscles in order to determine how similar                or dissimilar are muscles from different sources in their                       capacity for mechanical power output.  3)  To characterize force-               velocity curves for both shortening and lengthening muscles at                  different times after stimulation, and to use this information to               create a model which will allow estimation of the power output                  from a muscle subjected to periodic length change and phasic                    stimulation.  4)  To characterize release inactivation in muscle,               and to determine the extent to which release inactivation affects               power output during repetitive contraction.",
