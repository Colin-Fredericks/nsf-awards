 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific revolutions, how they occur, why some scientists make                the transition to the new theory and others do not are all issues               of central importance for understanding the nature and modes of                 development of science and technology.  Professor Margolis is                   bringing a cognitive science approach to these issues.                          Specifically, he is looking at two closely related projects                     extending his prior work.  The first project explores his novel                 hypothesis about the nature of scientific revolutions, the                      \"barrier hypothesis.\"  In the barrier hypotheses, Professor                     Margolis speculates that in paradigm shifts one can identify some               particularly stubborn intuition, the \"barrier,\" that must be                    overcome to permit the emergence of the new paradigm.  Further,                 as used in this hypothesis, the stubborn intuition requires the                 absence of any comparably well-entrenched contrary intuition.  He               has found that in some cases, the barrier may not even be                       something previously seen as central for the paradigm shift.  In                the Copernican Revolution, Professor Margolis found the barrier                 to be the nested spheres sense of how the heavens are                           constructed.  For the Darwinian Revolution, he found it to be the               perceived intuition that a world that demonstrates design must                  have had a designer.  In this research project he will extend his               analysis of the barrier hypothesis by examining the chemical                    revolution of Lavoisier.                                                                                                                                        A second part of his research under this grant will examine the                 role of continuity in revolutions.  As a case in point, he will                 examine the transparent way of showing the relations which                      permit transformation of the Ptolemaic into the Tychonic into the               Copernican system so that the observational equivalence that                    holds across all three systems becomes particularly easy to see.                This study will allow him to make number of novel points about                  the history of these transformations, several of which tie into                 the \"barrier\" idea.",
