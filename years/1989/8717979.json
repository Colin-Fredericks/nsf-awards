 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research             project in atomic physics between Bogomil Obelic of the Rudjer                  Boskovic Institute and Mitio Inokuti from Argonne National                      Laboratory is to study the ionization properties of low-energy                  photons and charged atomic particles in gases of radiological                   interest. By observing ionization processes, scientists can learn               about specific properties and atomic structure of gases.                        Furthermore, the proposed investigation has importance for modeling             the biological effects of certain types of radiation.  A benefit of             this international collaboration is the joining of the theoretical              expertise of the U.S. scientist with the experimental focus of the              Yugoslav investigator.                                                                                                                                          This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and is supported through a                joint fund consisting of matching contributions from the U.S. and               Yugoslav governments.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by            the Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  The grants are            composed principally of Yugoslav dinars and made to the principal               Yugoslav institute.  Grants include travel for U.S. scientists to               Yugoslavia and a modest dollar allowance for Yugoslav scientists'               living expenses in the U.S.",
