 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Price's project involves mathematical research                   that is motivated by quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanical                  point of view is to represent observable quantities by linear                   operators on Hilbert space rather than by scalars. In some                      models, the observables give rise to an algebra of operators.                   Time evolution is given by a coherent rule specifying a                         transformation of the algebra at each moment. Mathematical                      manipulations allow one to read off properties of the system                    being modeled from the way it evolves over time. In the present                 undertaking, a rather general sort of time evolution, called a                  semigroup of endomorphisms, is to be studied with the goal of                   obtaining a scheme of classification. This project is funded                    under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions activity; there                is a component of the research that will be carried out by                      undergraduate students.                                                              Cocycle conjugacy invariants finer than the recently                       discovered quantized Fredholm index of Arveson and Powers for                   these semigroups will be investigated. Professor Price will also                consider the representation theory of operator algebras generated               by pairs of isometric flows on Hilbert space that satisfy a                     certain commutation relation. The undergraduate component                       involves work on shift register sequences, a piece of                           cryptanalytic technology that seems to be related to shift                      endomorphisms of the hyperfinite factor.",
