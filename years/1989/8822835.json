The process has been found to be of                                     some promise as an advanced wastewater                                          treatment process for removing hydrophobic                                      compounds of low aqueous solubility and low                                     vapor pressure from the aqueous phase.                                          Laboratory experiments will be conducted to                                     elucidate the effects of co-solutes and co-                                     solvents upon the sublation of chlorinated                                      aromatic compounds, polychlorinated                                             aromatics, polynuclear aromatics and                                            chlorinated pesticides.  The method will be                                     extended to include ionic compounds such as                                     chloro-and nitrophenols which are more                                          soluble in water.  Results will be compared                                     against currently available mathematical                                        models of solvent sublation.  A new method of                                   generating air bubbles called colloidal gas                                     aphrons will be considered and evaluated as                                     an alternative to sparging.  This is expected                                   to provide information that can be used in                                      increasing the efficiency of conventional                                       bubble aeration processes.                                                                                                                                      Results of this research may prove to be                                        applicable for use in engineering design of a                                   process for removal of organic substances                                       from water and wastewater.  Target substances                                   include the polychlorinated biphenyls and                                       other nonpolar hydrophobic chemicals, of                                        significance in contamination of surface and                                    groundwater.",
