 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybrid zones are geographic areas where recently diverged                  species or subspecies come into secondary contact and interbreed                with varying success.  In doing so, hybrid organisms are produced               by the combination of genes that have diverged evolutionarily,                  and may therefore function less well than the matings between                   members of the same species or subspecies.  One important aspect                of this genetic incompatibility is the disruption of development                (the growth of an individual from embryo to adult).  This                       disruption can be manifest by left-right asymmetry of an                        individual.  Dr. Robert Owen proposes to gather morphological                   data on left-right asymmetry of mammals in four different well-                 studied hybrid zones in order to determine the correlation                      between genetic divergence and developmental disruption.  He                    proposes to use a microcomputer-based image analysis system to                  gather skeletal measurements from specimens from which a variety                of genetic data have been gathered in earlier studies.                               The proposed project will add an unprecedented body of                     detailed morphological data to our existing knowledge of hybrid                 zones, thereby opening a new window onto the questions of                       evolutionary divergence, and the genetic control of development.",
