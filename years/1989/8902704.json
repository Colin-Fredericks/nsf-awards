The first involves nonlinear evolution equations                      focusing on commutator estimates involving fractional                           derivatives.  These estimates are used to obtain                                local-to-global information on bilinear pseudodifferential                      operators illustrating, for example, how Euler and                              Navier-Stokes equations can be continued indefinitely if the                    deformation tensor and vorticity remains finite.                                     Work will also be done in developing information about the                 local regularity and asymptotic behavior of solutions to                        nonlinear dispersive equations.  Specific examples include the                  generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations for which there are no                  known global existence-uniqueness results. Moreover, numerical                  calculations suggest a blow-up of solutions when the power of                   the function in the equation exceeds five.                                           The third area concerns the Cauchy problem for the                         three-dimensional thermoelasticity system (for a homogeneous                    medium). The equations form a coupled hyperbolic-parabolic                      system.  An immediate goal of the research is to determine                      whether the behavior of small solutions is controlled by the                    hyperbolic part or by the parabolic part.  For the pure elastic                 case, this problem has been studied earlier, however the                        techniques used are not applicable in the present context.                      Later work will consider the question of characterizing the                     nonlinear terms of the systems which can lead to singularities                  or solutions which have small initial data.",
