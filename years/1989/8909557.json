 "awd_abstract_narration": "The capture of energy from a stimulus and the initiation of a                   response signal in the nervous system is termed sensory                         transduction.  In the chemosensory pathways, including taste and                smell, chemical stimulant molecules often act by binding to                     highly specific receptor sites on the membrane of the sensory                   cell.  This binding is in some way coupled to a characteristic                  change in the membrane that initiates an electrical signal.  It                 is likely that in many cases the transduction process involves                  internal messenger molecules or ions, such as cyclic                            nucleotides,calcium, or lipid metabolites.  The microscopic                     aquatic single-celled organism Paramecium shows simple                          chemosensory behavior, has many interesting mutant strains, and                 its cell membrane has several properties similar to excitable                   nerve cells. It has been a very successful model system for                     clarifying some aspects of chemosensory reception.                                                                                                              This project will explore the structure, function, and                          distribution of chemoreceptor sites in Paramecium, and how they                 interact with levels of internal calcium in the transduction                    process.  One of the important stimulus molecules is a cyclic                   nucleotide compound, cAMP, closely related to the well-known ATP                that has vital metabolic functions.  Molecular genetics will be                 used to clone and sequence the gene for the membrane protein                    thatacts as the binding receptor site for cAMP.  Once the gene                  sequence is predicted, antibodies to shorter peptide sequences                  within that gene will be made to probe receptor structure and                   distribution, and to predict the functional domains of the                      receptor molecule.  Calcium levels will be measured using dyes,                 and normal and mutant strains will be used to characterize the                  nature of the \"molecular pump\" driven by ATP that extrudes                      calcium.                                                                                                                                                        Findings from this novel model system will have considerable                    impact on chemosensory work, because very few chemosensory                      receptors have yet been characterized, and no common patterns                   have emerged yet.  The results, along with those on the calcium                 pump, are likely to be important also to neuroscientists in                     general, since many of the mechanisms may be similar to those                   found in the functioning synaptic contacts between neurons.",
