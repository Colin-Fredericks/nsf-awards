 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal examines how changes in product liability law over                time influence patterns of innovation in industries.  The project               outlines an interesting mix of theory (relating to the role of                  incentives in regulation) and empirically-based application                     (using a large data base on insurance practices), and builds on                 earlier work of the researchers that has had an important                       influence on the development of regulatory policies.  The primary               hypotheses of the project are well-defined and deal with the                    effects of product liability costs and management decisions on                  research and development expenditures and new product                           introductions.  The selected data sets are appropriate to the                   study of these issues and will allow for detailed analyses                      relating to the effects of regulatory policies on industries of                 specified sizes and types.  Results of the research will lead to                better models of the firm, emphasizing the influence of the real-               world legal environment, and a better understanding of the                      criteria by which to assess legislation dealing with innovation                 and product development.",
