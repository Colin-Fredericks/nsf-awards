 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research of this proposal assumes that a major                     factor in the regulation of gene expression is the population and               concentration of trans acting protein factors, and that                         developmental regulation is largely a function of the regulation                of trans factor gene expression and/or trans factor covalent                    modification. For this reason Dr. Dure wishes to study the                      regulation of expression of a developmental trans factor gene                   from a higher plant, cotton. Specifically he wishes to: 1) purify               a trans factor for a developmentally regulated set of genes, 2)                 via the trans factor cDNA, isolate and sequence the trans factor                gene, 3) examine the structure of the trans factor protein and                  identify its DNA binding domain and gene activation domain, 4)                  describe the temporal period of expression of the trans factor                  gene in ontogeny by measuring mRNA and protein levels of the                    trans factor and comparing them to the temporal period of                       expression of the genes it activates, 5) should these temporal                  periods not coincide, examine the possible regulation of trans                  factor activity by covalent modification. Ultimately Dr. Dure                   wishes to express the storage protein gene(s)in nuclei isolated                 from non-expressing tissue (leaves) by interaction with the trans               factor and other nuclear factors.                                               %%%                                                                             Dr. Dure is interested in the factors which regulate gene                       expression of cotton seed storage proteins. He is using this as a               model system for studying the tissue and time specific gene                     expression during development.",
