 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study aims to evaluate the validity, and hence the                         utility, of suicide statistics in the United States, an                         essential prerequisite for analyzing the causes of suicide.                     This research follows up on earlier work by the principal                       investigators which found a misreporting of suicide in 1969-                    70.  The present study draws on sociological theory to                          examine how the personal, professional and community ties of                    coroners and medical examiners operate to influence their                       decisions in classifying \"suspicious\" deaths.  This network                     approach will be tested using data collected from all                           coroners and medical examiners in the United States in 1989                     and 1990.  These data will be used in conjunction with other                    data from the U.S. Census, the National Council of Churches,                    and the Nation Center for Health Statistics.  Given the                         growing concern about the rise in reported rates of suicide                     in the United States, especially among youth, research on the                   reporting process itself is critical.  This study should shed                   light on how official rates might be adjusted to identify                       high risk groups and, in the process, clarify the underlying                    causes of suicide.",
