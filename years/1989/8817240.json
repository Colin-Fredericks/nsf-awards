 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at understanding the principles underlying                the mechanisms of light energy conversion in the photosynthetic                 reaction center protein from bacteria.  The principal cofactor of               interest is the quinone of the protein's two sites of oxidation-                reduction catalysis (QA and QB).  Quinone chemistry is at an                    advanced stage of understanding and many structures are at hand.                The reaction center is well-characterized, the quinones can be                  reversibly removed and site-directed mutants can be generated.                  Dr. Dutton plans to measure the binding affinities of a wide                    variety of quinones for the QA site, compare in vitro and in situ               electrochemical properties, make structural determinations on                   quinone-replaced reaction centers using electron paramagnetic                   resonance and X-ray diffraction and measure electron transfer                   events and kinetics.                                                                                                                                            It is now well-established that in photosynthesis the reaction                  center protein accepts light energy and initiates a series of                   intra-protein electron transfer steps that are directed                         vectorially across the supporting cytoplasmic membrane.  The                    reaction center cofactors contained within three subunits of the                reaction center include four bacteriochlorophylls, two                          bacteriopheophytins, two quinones and an iron atom.***//",
