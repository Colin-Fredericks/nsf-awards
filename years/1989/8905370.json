 "awd_abstract_narration": "For a deeper understanding of the adsorption process in                         general and of the microstructure of the adsorbed phase in                      particular, this grant funds purchase of a spectrofluorometer                   capable of steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence                          measurements.  The equipment is provided with double                            monochromators at the excitation and emission ends for optimum                  performance and has the facility to record corrected                            luminescence decay-time measurements.  It was thyratron                         grated, flash lamp triggered nanosecond pulse to excite the                     luminescent samples.  It can also measure time-resolved                         spectra.                                                                                                                                                        Surfactants and polymers adsorbed on a solid surface from                       solution modify surface properties drastically.  Such                           phenomena have far reaching effects on the industrially and                     technologically important processes of flotation,                               flocculation, fine particle separation, oil recovery, and                       processing of electronic and ceramic green bodies.  Earlier                     workers have focused on measurements such as adsorption                         density, zeta potentials, and contact angels.  Recent efforts                   using fluorescence spectroscopy have demonstrated the                           potential of luminescence techniques to elucidate the                           structure and dynamics of evolution of the adsorbed layer in                    great detail.  This award will significantly expand such work.",
