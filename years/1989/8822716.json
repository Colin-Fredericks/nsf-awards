 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent successes of theoretical chemistry with improved                     programs and faster computers have generated a need for still                   faster machines.  Experienced users wish to solve larger and                    larger problems of more and more relevance to the experimental                  chemist.  Similarly, experimental chemists, seeing these                        results, are compelled to become new users.  The acquisition of                 state-of-the-art computational equipment is essential to the                    modern chemistry department carrying out frontier research as                   well as training the next generation of chemists.                                                                                                               The Department of Chemistry of the California State University                  (CSU), Sacramento will use this Research at Undergraduate                       Institutions (RUI) award, jointly-supported by the Chemical                     Instrumentation Program, the Instrumentation for Materials                      Research Program and the Division of Advanced Scientific                        Computing, to help acquire an advanced research computer that                   will be available to chemistry faculty throughout the nineteen                  CSU campuses.  The acquisition of the computer will help to                     train and involve udergraduates in modern computer methodology                  and will enhance research in the following areas of chemistry:                                                                                                  1) Quantum chemistry of solids                                                  2) Brownian dynamics simulations of semi-rigid macromolecules                   3) Molecular orbital studies of tubercostatic thioamides                        4) Ab initio calculations on fluorine and silicon                                  containing molecules                                                         5) Gaussian and MNDO molecular orbital calculations on cage                        polyboranes                                                                  6) Molecular orbital calculations of the reaction path for the                     thermolysis of dioxetanes.",
