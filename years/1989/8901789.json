 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim is to construct efficient query processing strategies                   in a general distributed database environment. The database                     management systems at different sites may bedifferent; the                      network can be a local network or a long.haulnetwork or an                      interconnection of local networks by longdistance lines; the                    queries submitted by the user can be standard database queries                  or logic queries, permitting deduction. The system being                        developed needs to be capable of learning important semantic                    information from previously processed queries so that future                    queries can be processed efficiently.                                                                                                                           In this project, new strategies will be implemented and their                   performance will be compared to strategies proposed by other                    researchers. An integration of useful strategies will  be                       carried out.                                                                                                                                                    Results in the following areas are expected: new techniques to                  acquire  knowledge for semantic query optimization; new                         techniques to process logic queries efficiently; and                            implementation principles for efficient query processing.                       These results will have a significant influence on the design                   of advanced query processing systems.",
