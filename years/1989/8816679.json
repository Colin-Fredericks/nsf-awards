Participants will meet at Lake Arrowhead, CA, on            September 24-27, 1989, to exchange information and ideas on the                 subject of the application of fractal geometry, in which identical              forms are repeated on various size scales, to research into geological          fracture.                                                                                                                                                       Observations of fractal geometry have recently been quantified and              incorporated into mathematical models for such tectonic processes as            earthquakes, and into descriptions of the internal structure of fault           zones.  However, many fundamental questions regarding the physics of            the failure process which produces fractal fracture patterns, the               significance of the fractal dimension scale, and upper and lower                fractal limits, remain.  Considering the large amount of recent                 research on these questions in both the U.S. and Japan, and the                 importance of this research to geology in general and earthquake                prediction in particular, this meeting is timely and likely to have             important impact.",
