 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently isolated genes from the cyanobacterium Nostoc PCC 7906                 will be used together with molecular genetic and biochemical                    manipulations of cyanobacteria to investigate aspects of the                    structure and function of the cytochrome b6-f complex.  This                    membrane protein complex (the                                                   plastoquinol-plastocyanin/cytochrome c oxidoreductase) is                       essential for photosynthetic electron transport and energy                      transduction in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria.  Unresolved                     problems include the pathways of electron transfer and proton                   translocation through these complexes, the ligands for some of                  the prosthetic groups, the nature of binding sites for the                      quinone substrates, and the molecular basis of functional                       differences between the b6-f and the related mitochondrial-type                 b-cl cytochrome complexes.  An obstacle to genetic analysis of                  the cytochrome complex is its essential role in cyanobacteria for               both photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport.  Thus one               goal of the research is to establish means for the conditional                  expression of genes bearing potentially debilitating mutations.                 The specific goals are: 1) Expression of the Nostoc gene for the                Rieske Fe-S protein of the complex in Escherichia coli and in                   vitro reconstitution of a catalytically active complex from the                 cloned protein and a Rieske-depleted complex.  2) Mutagenesis of                the Fe-S binding domain of the Rieske protein followed by in                    vitro reconstitution to determine the nature of possible S and N                ligands for the Fe-S center.  3) Determination of transcription                 start sites of the two Nostoc cytochrome complex operons for                    possible conditional expression of mutated genes under anaerobic                N2-fixing conditions.  4) Expression of the Nostoc cytochrome                   complex genes in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 7002 for                  the possible conditional analysis of mutated genes.  5) Random                  mutagenesis of a region of the gene for the subunit-IV protein to               determine the identities and roles of amino acid residues                       involved in quinol oxidation.                                                                                                                                   Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts share a fundamentally similar                    photosynthetic apparatus.  Cyanobacterial genes, however, unlike                those of chloroplasts, can be manipulated genetically and                       replaced with altered genes.  These techniques allow the genetic                dissection of protein structure/function and powerfully                         complement biochemical and biophysical approaches.  The proposed                research would contribute to the elucidation of structure and                   function in the cytochrome b6-f complex to which molecular                      genetic analyses have not yet been applied.  One of the reactions               of this complex, quinol-oxidation, is the rate limiting step in                 photosynthetic electron transport.  Thus genetic manipulations of               protein structure at the quinol-oxidation site might lead to                    improvements in the photosynthetic efficiency of crop plants or                 to applications for specific herbicides.  The project in                        addition has significance to the general understanding of                       electron transfer and energy transduction processes in biological               membranes.",
