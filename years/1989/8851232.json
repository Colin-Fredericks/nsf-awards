 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to revitalize a teaching laboratory               in the Department of Psychology which was initiated a decade ago                to improve the breadth and scope of its undergraduate curriculum.               The lab offers eight undergraduate laboratory courses to its 900                majors in a shared microcomputer-based teaching facility.   Funds               will be used to replace its once state of the art, but now worn                 out microcomputer with powerful and flexible modern equipment.                  While the instructional programs currently in use in all eight                  courses can be quickly migrated to execute on the new equipment,                the focus of the effort will be on the Laboratory in Cognition,                 which served as the prototype for the other courses.  In this                   effort, the Project Director will incorporate the major                         enhancements to the curriculum that he is completing for CONDUIT                (but cannot be implemented on current equipment) and will                       endeavor to push the field ahead by using new technology to                     devise laboratory experiences that were not previously feasible.                After appropriate evaluation and testing, these new instructional               materials will be widely disseminated.  The grantee institution                 is matching this NSF award with funds from non-Federal sources.",
