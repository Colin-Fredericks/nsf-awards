 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be carried out on optically pumped alkali                    vapor targets.  This research is important for both polarized                   ion sources and targets.  Research on low relaxation rate wall                  coatings for optically pumped Na, K, and Rb vapors will be                      carried out.  Both liquid and solid coatings will be studied                    with emphasis placed on studing liquid coatings that are easily                 replaced by flowing fresh liquid and that may heal themselves                   when damaged.  Research on the limitations imposed by radiation                 trapping on the density and polarization of an optically pumped                 alkali vapor target as a function of the magnetic field will be                 carried out.  Both the relaxation rate and radiation trapping                   research is important for improving the optically pumped alkali                 vapor target used as the charge transfer target in the                          optically pumped polarized hydrogen ion source.  Research on a                  spin exchange polarized hydrogen target for nuclear scattering                  is also proposed.  Finally research on the prospects for the                    direct extraction of polarized ions from an optically pumped                    alkali vapor-hydrogen discharge is proposed.",
