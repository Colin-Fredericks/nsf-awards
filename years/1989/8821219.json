 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to optimize interdisciplinary approaches that capitalize               upon new technical and theoretical developments, a Center for the               Neurobiology of Learning and Memory is being established at the                 Beckman Institute (currently under construction) of the                         University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign .  This center will                  serve as 1) a Resource Center, providing advanced facilities for                the study of the learning and memory process, including optical                 imaging (for histological studies), multi-electrode array                       recording (to allow functional patterns of interactions among                   neurons to be examined), and rapid tissue freezing (for                         assessment of sub-cellular dynamics); 2) a Research Center that                 fosters communication and collaboration among scientists pursuing               common and related problems of memory and neural plasticity; 3) a               Training Center which prepares graduate and postdoctoral                        investigators for research careers in learning and memory, and 4)               a Recruiting Center that to attract outstanding young people to                 scientific careers.                                                                                                                                             This program of scientific development and interaction is taking                advantage of the unusual resources of the Beckman Institute and                 the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus in                           neurobiology, interdisciplinary collaboration and cooperation,                  and strengths of the component disciplines of neural and                        behavioral sciences.  Technical foci of the Center include large                array neurophysiological recording facilities, with which the                   interactions among brain regions during learning are studied;                   rapid freezing facilities for examining brain slices in vitro,                  (with which the nature of plasticity at the level of the synapse                is studied), and neuroanatomical imaging and analysis facilities                (where memory processes are studied at levels ranging from the                  molecular to the morphological).                                                                                                                                Several types of learning are being studied, including                          discriminative conditioning, acquisition of motor skill,                        acquisition of acoustic discriminative ability, and the                         traditional psychological animal learning tasks such as mazes.                  In addition, current \"models\" of memory (such as long-term                      potentiation and kindling) are being examined.  The function of                 the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory is to                    advance our knowledge of brain substrates of learning and memory                from the cellular and molecular to the integrative brain system                 levels.",
