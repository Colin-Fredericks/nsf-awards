The research environment will be enriched by additional                  undergraduate students funded from other sources.  Each                         participant will have regular meetings with an individual                       faculty mentor to plan work and review progress throughout the                  eleven week program.  Project topics in electrophysics will                     include artificial plasmas, microwave propagation, microstrip                   antennas, frequency doubling in lasers, picosecond opto-                        electronics, and thin film devices.  Information systems topics                 will include image communication, multivariable feedback control,               continuous phase modulation digital signalling, local area                      network simulation tools, and sonar signal spectrum estimation.                 Participants will have informative tours of research                            laboratories.  There will be two or three seminar presentations                 to the group by leaders from industry, universities or government               agencies.  A tour will be arranged at a nearby industrial lab or                national laboratory.  The program will terminate with a two-day                 research review during which each student will make a 15 minute                 presentation and answer questions.  The mentor will assist the                  student in preparation of the printed abstract of his report, and               with preparation for the presentation.  A monetary prize will be                awarded to the best project.",
