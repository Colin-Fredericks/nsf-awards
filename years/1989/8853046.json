 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award provides funds for equipment to improve the breadth of                laboratory experience provided upper division undergraduates                    enrolled in General, Environmental, Mammalian, and Invertebrate                 Physiology courses at the University of Southern Mississippi.                   The vehicle for such training will be a required team taught                    laboratory course emphasizing experimental approaches to problem                solving and featuring a diverse array of laboratory exercises,                  models and protocols.                                                                                                                                           The instrumentation to be obtained includes refrigerated animal                 holding facilities, a biological oxygen monitor, physiological                  recorder with accessories, flame photometer, organ/tissue baths                 and computer with software.  These items will upgrade existing                  facilities, augment the capabilities (through allowing use of                   additional experimental models and investigations of new                        phenomena) and provide opportunities for computer simulation of                 significant aspects of physiology which are normally impractical                to investigate directly in a classroom setting.  The grantee is                 matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
