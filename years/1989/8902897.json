 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of a v-mos oncoprotein on glucocorticoid-induction of               metallothionein-1 (Mt-1) gene expression have been evaluated                    using the rat 6m2 cell line, in which expression of the p85gag-                 mos oncogene, and consequently transformation, are temperature-                 sensitive (ts).  The p85gag-mos oncogene, and consequently                      transformation, are temperature-sensitive (ts).  The                            temperature-dependent expression of p85gag-mos in 6m2 cells                     resulted in only a transient dexamethasone induction of Mt-1                    levels, that rapidly declined to uninduced levels despite the                   continued presence of hormone.  Nuclear run-on assays will be                   performed to determine to what extent transient induction of Mt-1               mRNA levels reflect v-mos effects on transcription.  The                        examination of the kinetics and reversibility of desensitized Mt-               1 expression, using both temperature-shift experiments and                      hormone withdrawal and restimulation, will reveal whether v-mos                 accelerates a \"normal\" deinduction process or affects an                        independent desensitization pathway.  Glucocorticoid regulated                  expression, both positive and negative of endogenous and                        transfected genes will be analyzed in various ts v-mos-                         transformed cell types.                                                                                                                                         These analyses will determine whether oncoprotein effects can be                distinguished for hormonal responses that may be cell type                      specific and subject to multi-hormonal control.   They will also                allow corrorlations, if any exist, between v-mos mediated                       alterations in hormone regulated gene expression and                            glucocorticoid receptor function.",
