 "awd_abstract_narration": "Certain mechanical systems, especially robotic systems operating                in the presence of obstacles, are subjected to sudden changes in                their motion in avoiding the obstacles.  Such changes can severely              affect the system's performance by inducing vibrations and thereby              inaccuracies.  Most research on robot collision avoidance has                   focused on description of the obstacles and derivation of the                   geometric (kinematic) conditions for avoiding collision between                 bodies.  The related dynamics problem has not received a great deal             of attention.  The objective of this research is to develop a                   control algorithm that will be able to control the system dynamics              to accommodate the rapid changes in motion.  The methodology used               in this project is based upon the variational formulation of                    dynamics.  The controller developed will provide the optimum                    control forces to satisfy constraint conditions, can be activated               at any specified time of a prescribed task interval, and will be                computationally efficient to implement.  This research will be                  carried out for redundant rigid robotic systems.  If successful,                subsequent research will explore broader application of the method              to high speed flexible systems.  Smoother motion associated with                this controller could improve system performance, reliability, and              position accuracy.",
