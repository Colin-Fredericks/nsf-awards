 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Laboratory investigation is proposed to explore the                      hypothesis that some collisions between supercooled                             precipitation drop result in freezing and that a collision-ice                  nucleation mechanism may account for the kind and number of first               ice particles in warm-based midwestern convective clouds.                            An apparatus will be constructed that will produce isolated                collisions between supercooled drops initially falling freely at                terminal velocity.  Experiments will be conducted over a range of               collector drop sizes and size ratios.  Collisions will be                       recorded photographically to measure the possible dependency of                 freezing on impact angle and occurrence of coalescence, bounce or               temporary coalescence.  Data will first be collected for                        minimally charged drops created from distilled deionized water.                      By exploring a relatively overlooked but prevalent                         microphysical process, the goal of this research is to provide a                better understanding of the role of supercooled drop collisions                 in the production of ice in clouds and the consequent influence                 these may have on the production of rain in the warm-based                      convective clouds of the midwestern United States. //",
