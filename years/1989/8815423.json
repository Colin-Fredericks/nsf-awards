 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the fish genus Poeciliopsis (Poeciliidae) all female                    clones coexist in Mexican desert streams with males and females                 of closely related sexually reproducing species.  Past work has                 confirmed that genetically fixed differences in the use of food                 resources and habitat space contribute to the coexistence of                    sexual and asexual lines.  The proposed study consists of two                   parts.  (1) Competition experiments within and between two clonal               lines and a sexual line will be conducted in artificial streams                 to test whether genetically variable populations show lowered                   intraspecific competition relative to monoclonal populations.                   Results from this study will shed light on the ecological                       advantage of sexual reproduction.  (2) Field studies will                       quantify natural densities and relative frequencies of the two                  clonal lines and the sexual line.  Results from these collections               will show the relative reproductive success of the above three                  lines in a range of densities and relative frequencies.                              Such ecological studies are necessary for increasing                       knowledge of the costs and benefits of genetic variability in                   natural populations.  However, this study also has potential                    applied value as well.  Genetically uniform populations can grow                well in controlled environments, such as well fertilized and well               watered agricultural fields, but are unlikely to perform as well                in uncontrolled environments.  Both aquaculturists and                          conservationists are confronted with maintaining populations in                 uncontrolled environments, and therefore need to understand the                 ecological benefits of maintaining genetic variation in these                   populations.",
