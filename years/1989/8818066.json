 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses some of the most fundamental questions                about processes that determine the evolution of flowering plants.               Individual plants can vary in the amount of pollen transported                  to, and fertilizing, other plants (male reproduction) as well as                pollen received and seeds set (female reproduction)  Using dyes                 to follow pollen transport by animal pollinators and genetic                    markers to determine paternity of seeds, Dr. Campbell will                      determine male as well as female reproductive success in a                      natural plant population.  The results will yield some of the                   first measurements of natural selection acting on flower traits                 through both male and female reproduction, and will allow tests                 of general theory on the evolution of breeding systems and energy               allocation to reproductive structures.  Behavioral studies of the               pollinators will seek to characterize the mechanisms of this                    selection.  In addition, methods of quantitative genetics will be               used to link field measurements of heritabilities and selection                 to current theory.  These studies will contribute to                            understanding of the roles of genetic constraints and conflicts                 between opposing selective pressures in determining the course of               evolution.  The results will have significance for both natural                 population and crop plants, particularly those in agricultural                  breeding programs dealing with seed and fruit production.",
