 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to identify the heritability of the ways                in which an annual plant uses water and nitrogen when exposed to                water stress.  Although plants of different species vary in the                 efficiency with which they use water and nitrogen, very little is               known about whether such variability exists within species, and                 whether the variability can be manipulated through traditional                  plant breeding techniques.  In this research, plants of the same                species from naturally \"wet\" and \"dry\" environments will be                     crossed to establish a group of progeny of known genetic origin.                Then the ways in which the plants use water and nitrogen to                     produce new growth will be studied.  The research will focus on                 the efficiency of the photosynthetic process and biomass-                       allocation processes to roots, shoots and flowers in using water                and nitrogen.  The investigators will also examine whether                      differences in the efficiency by which plants use nitrogen and                  water for photosynthesis and growth result in different yields of               fruits and seeds.  The results will provide a better                            understanding of the genetic controls over the photosynthetic                   efficiencies of using water and nitrogen to drive plant growth.                 Knowledge of such genetic controls could lead to significant                    breakthroughs in (1) the understanding of the evolution of                      photosynthetic processes in plants, and (2) the ability to begin                manipulating (through breeding programs) the efficiency of water                and nitrogen use in annual crop species of agronomic importance.",
