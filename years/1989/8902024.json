 "awd_abstract_narration": "A neutron reflectometer (POSY-II) has been recently constructed                 at the Intense Pulsed Neutron Source at Argonne National                        Laboratory which will be dedicated to the investigation of                      various problems involving polymers and other materials at                      surfaces and interfaces.  The instrument needs a scientist to                   operate the reflectometer as a user instrument, which means it                  will be available for basic research to the entire scientific                   community based on a proposal system.  There is a great deal of                 research that awaits to be performed on POSY-II, including the                  determination of the concentration profiles at surfaces in                      polymer blends, at interfaces between incompatible polymer                      phases, the concentration profile of partially deuterated block                 copolymers segregated at interfaces between the homopolymers,                   polymer-polymer interdiffusion over very small length scales,                   block copolymer ordering at surfaces, and the segment                           distribution of polymers tethered to surfaces and interfaces.                   Although not an exhaustive list of the research that will be                    performed on the reflectometer, these examples give a sense of                  the power of this technique when applied to questions in                        materials research.  The NSF contribution will be limited to the                salary of the scientist in charge of this user-oriented facility.",
