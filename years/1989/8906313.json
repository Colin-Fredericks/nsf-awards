 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent initiatives to monitor and model the complex relationships          between geophysical, biological, and climatic processes throughout the          world have emphasized the need to understand how people and human               institutions modify and respond to global environmental change.  Multi-         disciplinary, integrated research on the human dimensions of global             environmental change has been slow to develop, however, in part because         most social and natural scientists have had little experience in                working with scholars from other disciplines on large-scale analyses of         complex human and environmental interrelationships.  This project will          convene a small group of social and natural scientists from throughout          the nation for a conference at the University of California at Los              Angeles to assess how institutional structures at universities can be           altered to facilitate research and teaching on human and natural                dimensions of global environmental change.  Discussions at the                  conference will focus on identifying disciplinary and organizational            barriers that inhibit cooperative research and teaching.  Alternative           arrangements for enhancing cooperative work will be proposed and                evaluated.  A written report about the conference will be prepared for          distribution to scholars and administrators not in attendance.                       This conference will examine an important facet of the process of          encouraging and conducting research on a topic of rapidly growing               importance from both scholarly and applied perspectives.  Publication           of the results of this conference will enable the conclusions reached           by scholars in attendance to be shared with interested persons                  elsewhere.  As a result, the conference likely will have beneficial             impacts on research and teaching on global environmental change                 throughout the nation.",
