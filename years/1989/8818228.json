 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Richard A. Oriani, Professor         and Director, Corrosion Research Center, University of Minnesota, to            pursue with Dr. Su-Il Pyun, Department of Materials Science and                 Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology                 (KAIST), for a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research           on the effects of hydrogen on passivating films on iron and nickel.             The research will focus on three specific tasks, namely, (1) the                determination of mobility of hydrogen in passivating oxide films, (2)           the effects of hydrogen on the ionic and electronic properties of               passivating films, and (3) the effect of hydrogen on the pitting                characteristics of passivating films.                                                                                                                           The surface of iron and nickel objects often is protected from                  corrosion by surface layers of passivating oxide films.  In the present         project, the collaborators will study how hydrogen within passivating           oxide layers on metals behaves and how it modifies their properties.            The transport of hydrogen across a passivating layer appears to be              involved whenever free corrosion takes place in an acid medium because          hydrogen is found both within the metal and in the aqueous phase.  This         project will deal primarily with the kinetics and mechanism of hydrogen         transport in free corrosion and stress corrosion cracking in acid               media, but the research will contribute to an understanding of stress           corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue of metals.  Thus, the research         may have important applications in many settings, including corrosion           in heat exchangers for fission and fusion nuclear reactors.  The U.S.           and Korean collaborators are highly respected scientists who have a             record of successful collaboration.  This project is relevant to the            objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to         increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists            and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas,            skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual          benefit.  This project will add an international cooperative dimension          to Dr. Oriani's research under NSF Grant No. DMR-8714547.",
