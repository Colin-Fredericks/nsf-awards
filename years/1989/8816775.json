 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most abundant and most speciose fish at McMurdo Sound,                      Antarctica belong to the suborder Notothenioidei.  These fish                   live under conditions where it is often very dark, particularly                 under thick ice or during the winter.  This study will focus on                 the functional ramifications of the anatomically diverse lateral                line systems of these fish. The lateral line is a mechanosensory                structure which is hypothesized to play a role in feeding. The                  lateral line system of the notothenioidids includes features that               converge on those of fishes from other dark habitats such as the                deep ocean and caves.  This project will determine which                        notothenioids can use the lateral line to feed in the dark and                  will focus on two hypotheses:  (1) the lateral line is tuned to                 detect important prey and (2) deeper living fish have more                      sensitive lateral line systems.  This approach combines studies                 of behavioral responses to live prey and artificial stimuli,                    physiological responses of lateral line nerve fibers to                         artificial stimuli. and anatomical studies of the diverse lateral               line system. The role of the lateral line system in fish is not                 clearly understood and this research project will make an                       important contribution to the field.",
