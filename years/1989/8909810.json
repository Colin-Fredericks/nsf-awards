 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation of a computer based language processing                      formalism will focus on characteristics that facilitate the                     implementation of linguistic models.  It should not only be                     possible to embed such models in the system concisely, but the                  resulting system should be computationally efficient.  In order                 to achieve the form of the restrictions determined by the                       requirement that it be suitable for expressing natural language                 models.  In earlier work, the investigator identified several                   features common to a range of constrained grammar formalisms,                   despite their very different notations.  These features concern                 restrictions of the form of the derivation process, and appear to               indicate that each of these formalisms is amenable to efficient                 parallel parsing algorithms.  The research will now formalize the               common features of these systems and of their processing                        implications, using results from research on parallel models of                 computation.  This should lead to a deeper understanding of the                 desirable computational properties inherent in theories developed               by computational linguistics.",
