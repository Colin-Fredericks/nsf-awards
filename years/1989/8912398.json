The focus of the conference                       will be on f-and d-electron systems.  Topics of interest will                   include 1.  Anomalus f-and d-electron systems 2.  Mechanisms                    in high Tc and heavy fermion superconductors 3.  Magnetic                       ordering and coorelations.                                                      4.  Fluctuating valence 5.  Crystals field effects and 6.                       Heavy fermion phenomena.  The conference will bring together                    researchers working on various aspects of both d-and                            f-electron metallic systems and provide an interactive                          environment for the exchange of ideas.  The fifth Conference                    in this area was held in Bangalore, India during January 1987                   and was quite successful and resulted in Proceedings                            \"Theoretical and Experimental Aspects of Valence Fluctuations                   and Heavy Fermions,  Eds; L. C. Gupta and                                       S. K. Malik,\" published by Plenum, NY, in 1987.                                                                                                                 Scope:  This conference is the first in the U.S. in this                        field since 1981, with 5 conferences between 1981 and 1986                      held in Europe or Japan.  There are advantages to the meeting                   being held in the U.S. where more young researchers from the                    U.S. and other countries can attend.  The participation of                      Indian scientists is expected to enrich the meeting because                     of the active research in India.                                                Dr. R. Vijayaraghavan, Dean of Physics Faculty, Tata                            Institute of Fundamental Research, is the Coordinator of the                    Indian group.",
