 "awd_abstract_narration": "Averaged over long distances DNA is a smooth rod-like                           molecule, but on a smaller scale, the DNA helix can have                        bends or kinks in the molecule.  The conformational changes                     have two causes: (1) the nature of the base pairs and the                       interaction with contiguous pairs; (2) DNA binding proteins                     which coil DNA or distort a few base pairs.  The segment of                     the chromosome surrounding cos, the recognition signal for                      bacteriophage lambda DNA packaging, is bent due to its unsual                   base sequence.  In this same region are several binding sites                   for an E. coli protein, Integration Host Factor (IHF),                          required for efficient DNA packaging.  IHF severely bends DNA                   at one of its binding sites.  Experiments suggest that both                     kinds of bends may be important for the biological function                     of cos.  The conformation of the DNA sequence around cos, how                   of the DNA sequence around cos, how IHF binds and causes                        bending, and whether intrinsic bends in the DNA sequence can                    modulate protein-DNA interactions will be examined in detail.                   The experiments, on cloned, synthetic DNA fragments mimicking                   the natural variants of IHF binding sites found near cos,                       include protein-DNA binding assays, gel mobility                                measurements, and footprinting with agents sensitive to                         structural changes in DNA.                                                                                                                                      IHF is involved in many processes in E. coli, most notably                      recombination/transporsition reactions, as well as the                          control of gene expression, both transcriptionally and post-                    transcriptionally, the initiation of DNA replication, and DNA                   packaging for bacteriophage lambda (Friedman, 1988).  It is                     not known how such a small protein, with no known enzymatic                     function,  is utilized in such a variety of molecular genetic                   process in the bacterial cell.  Because IHF is so widely                        utilized, its role might be a generalized function, useful in                   many processes.  Bending is a function which could be useful                    in many processes to modulate protein binding in the region                     or to allow proteins bound to relatively distant sites to be                    placed in closer proximity.  Knowing how IHF binds to DNA and                   how IHF bends DNA could be the key to all these areas.",
