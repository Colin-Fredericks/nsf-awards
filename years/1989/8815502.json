 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                         research of Dr. Robert Squires at Purdue University. Dr.                        Squires will complete the development  of a Flowing                             Afterglow-Selected Ion Flow Tube-Triple Quadrupole(FA-SIFT-TQ)                  apparatus which will be a powerful new tool for gas-phase ion                   studies.  With the completion of the apparatus he will obtain                   new fundamental information about the structures, properties                    and reactivity of gas-phase ions.                                                                                     Several systems of                        interest will be studied. A new method for generating gas phase                 carbanions from collisionally activated carboxylates will                       provide the basis for studying stable alkyl anions and                          beta-substituted ethyl anions, for determining carbanion                        thermochemistry from threshold measurements and for                             investigating the configurational stabilities of vinyl and                      cyclopropyl anions. Hypervalent binary hydride anions will be                   explored with particular emphasis on the properties, reactivity                 and fluxional behavior of silicon and boron hydrides.                           Silicon-substituted carbenium ions will be generated and their                  structures and stabilities determined. Thermochemical data for                  reactive organic intermediates such as ylides,                                  cycloalkenylidenes and carbenes will be determined by                           activation methods. The results of this gas-phase ion research                  should have broad significance in many areas of chemistry and                   physics.",
