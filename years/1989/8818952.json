 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social traps are settings in which individual and collective                    welfare are in conflict.  For example, an individual taxpayer                   might be personally better off by acting (e.g., voting) to retain               special tax breaks or entitlements, yet the nation as a whole                   might be better off if many such preferences were eliminated.                   One reason individuals may not act in the whole group's welfare                 is that they believe that such cooperative acts have little                     impact and/or that the group cannot successfully avoid the trap.                This research explores how such beliefs are formed and how they                 guide cooperative behavior in social traps.  One study explores                 how the necessity for coordinated effort in many social                         situations may undermine confidence in the effectiveness of                     personal cooperation.  Another study examines whether people feel               less overwhelmed by very large social problems when the problems                are broken up into smaller parts.  Another study explores whether               people sometimes excuse their failure to cooperate in a group by                saying their contributions just don't matter, and thereby                       convince themselves that future cooperation is also pointless.                  Yet another study tries to determine when a sense of helplessness               might counteract other factors that would normally increase                     cooperation (e.g., loyalty to the group).  This research will a)                contribute to basic knowledge on how people think and act in                    social traps and b) suggest ways of strengthening peoples'                      beliefs that they and the groups to which they belong can solve                 their groups' problems.",
