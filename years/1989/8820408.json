 "awd_abstract_narration": "Considerable attention has been devoted in the United States and           elsewhere to the analysis of the factors that result in different rates         of economic development in peripheral rural areas versus more densely           settled urban enclaves.  Of particular interest have been the roles of          federal government-sponsored development programs and local initiatives         as stimulants of economic growth.  This project will analyze the ways           in which central and local development strategies have influenced the           rapid expansion of export-oriented, small- and medium-sized economic            establishments over the last decade in western Jutland, the most                peripheral part of Denmark.  A qualitative evaluation of at least a             dozen hypotheses will be based on data on economic activity, surveys of         establishment executives, and interviews with many of those executives          as well as business leaders in related fields, labor leaders,                   government officials, educators, and other analysts.  Through analysis          of these sources, new insights should be formed on the role of public           policies as well as the impact of other factors on the success of a             rapidly growing set of economic activities.                                          This project will provide much new information about the                   conditions and processes that have influenced economic growth in                Jutland in the last decade, but it also will provide a solid basis for          generalization to other locales in order to determine the degree to             which elements of the Danish experience can be generalized.  The                methodology will be replicable, permitting extension of this work to            other locales where the same or different strategies have been or               might be employed.  Among the areas about which this research is likely         to provide new information and perspectives are more peripheral parts           of the U.S., including the Mississippi Delta region, the Mexican                border region, and the Pacific Northwest.",
