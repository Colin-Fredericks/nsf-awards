The purpose of this exchange                is threefold: (1) To compare and contrast R&D on generic                        technologies that include robotics in hazardous environments and                in service-related area; (2) To stimulate thinking about                        \"strategic alliance\" between the two countries; and (3) To                      provide an opportunity (by site visits to Japan) to observe                     recent applications of robotics, particularly in unstructured                   environments.  Among the results of this exchange will be a                     report by the National Research Council and the U.S. Group on                   their recommendations of potential projects and ways of joint                   research that cannot be easily done by each country alone.",
