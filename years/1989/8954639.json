 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide Washington MESA teachers with a forum                   through which they can acquire new information on factors                       that impact math and science learning as well as time to work                   with colleagues on strategies to incorporate the new material                   into their classroom.  Fifty-five Washington MESA teachers                      will be able to attend a series of six one-day seminars.  Of                    these two will be statewide seminars back-to-back with                          national or state conferences and will be focused on math and                   science education or on multicultural issues that impact                        learning.  The other four seminars will be local, focused on                    curriculum development, instructional practices, and career                     explorations.  The areas of focus for the seminar series will                   include the incorporation of \"hands-on\" activities; problems                    set in a real-world context; and strengthening the                              perceptions that underrepresented minority students warrant                     high expectations; and sharing of materials, activities, and                    projects that work well at various levels.  Seminar                             participants will come from 8 districts which serve 71% of                      the under-represented minority students across Washington                       state.                                                                                                                                                          An amount equivalent to 115.8% of the NSF award is being                        contributed as cost-sharing.",
