 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development of artificial intelligence              methods for finding short-term patterns in international behavior.              Much of the contemporary study of international politics focuses on             \"events\":  discrete interactions between nation-states.  Events may be          as dramatic as the outbreak of war or the signing of a major trade              agreement, or as simple as one government congratulating another on its         independence day.  Individual events can be group into event sequences          which describe more complicated behaviors such as conflicts,                    negotiations or changes in relations.                                           Human observers of international behavior such as journalists,                  historians and political scientists know that international events              follow patterns.  A war will almost inevitably be preceded by                   escalating tensions; a trade agreement will be preceded by months of            negotiations.  These patterns provide enough regularity in                      international affairs that expert analysts usually have a good idea of          what the likely next events will be, and can also detect unusual                changes in behavior.                                                            This project will use pattern recognition methods developed in                  artificial intelligence to detect short-term regularities in                    contemporary events in the Middle East.  The events will be coded from          the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) reports available from         the U.S. Government Printing Office.  FBIS reports several hundred              events per day:  these will be coded into standard categories of                events, then the computer programs will look for repeated patterns in           those events data.  Those patterns can then be used to make predictions         much as human analysts use the observed regularities in international           behavior to make predictions.                                                   The project uses two artificial intelligence methods.  One method               constructs \"partially-ordered event sequences\" - - sequences of events          which are observed repeatedly because certain events must be preceded           by other events (for example, one must have negotiations before one can         have a trade agreement).  The other method uses \"genetic algorithms\",           which assemble complex event sequences out of simpler sequences using           a process resembling evolution.  The Principal Investigator has already         published several papers employing these methods on historical data;            this project will be the first to use them on contemporary data.                The project will make three contributions to the understanding of               international behavior.  First, it will be one of the first efforts to          create a computer model of the day-to-day behavior of a contemporary            international system, the Middle East.  While international relations           theory has provided a number of computer models for long-term trends in         international politics, relatively little work has been done on short-          term behavior.  Second, the project will create general tools for               finding patterns in political behavior.  While these techniques are             being developed to study international behavior, the same methods could         be used to study any other political, economic or social behavior which         can be described using events.  Finally, the project will provide some          new tools for dealing with large amounts of data generated on a daily           basis using relatively inexpensive microcomputer equipment.",
