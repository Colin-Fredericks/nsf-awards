 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research objectives are the following:  (1) to map marine                  terraces in four field areas where at least four flights of                     marine terraces are present; (2) to establish numerical ages of                 terraces through collection of datable material form terrace                    deposits; (3) to study soil development on marine terraces for                  identifying soil chronosequences and soil chronofunctions,                      correlating terraces based on soil development, and investigating               capabilities of a computer-simulation model for assigning                       numerical ages to marine terraces; (4) to correlate terraces                    among study sites; and (5) to analyze late Quaternary                           deformation.  The last objective entails compilation of absolute                magnitudes of deformation at the different sites, compilation of                uplift, tilt and fault-slip rates, and determination of the                     extent to which deformation is segmented into structural domains                along the coast.                                                                     We anticipate that we will be successful in assigning                      numerical ages to at least the lower one or two terraces at each                study site.  If the soil development simulation model is                        feasible, then numerical ages of all terraces are a possibility.                Mapping to date (described below) demonstrates that deformation                 along the southern coast of Oregon is not uniform in space or in                time, but rather the coast is segmented into broad warps.  Faults               are associated with these broad warps, and some of these faults                 appear to be boundaries of structural segments.  Therefore, we                  also anticipate that we will be able to identify tectonic                       segments that have different coastline lengths, areas, and                      deformation rates (or ranges of rates).  Both the lengths of                    segments and the relative ages of deformation within these                      segments should serve as a basis for identifying segments of the                coast with different characteristic tectonic responses to                       subduction.",
