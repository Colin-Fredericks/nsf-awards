 "awd_abstract_narration": "Katharine B. Payne has discovered that elephants emit                           \"infrasonic\" vocalizations, calls with sound frequencies below                  the range that is audible by people.  Much evidence suggests that               these low-frequency calls of free-ranging African elephants                     function over long distances and play an important role in the                  organization of elephant society.  For instance, Rowan B. Martin                has tracking data on elephant matriarchs in the Sengwa Research                 Area in Zimbabwe, showing a long history of movements that are                  coordinated even between elephants separated by 1 to 10                         kilometers of woodlands.  To study this phenomenon, Payne,                      Langbauer, and Martin will will attach radio microphones and                    transmitters to the collars of the same Sengwa elephants, and                   will simultaneously monitor their vocalizations and movement                    patterns over at least two months.  Behavioral observations from                aircraft and ground vehicles will supplement the continuous                     tracking and acoustic data, which will be entered into a computer               in the field and later analyzed at Cornell University.  In a                    collaborative study, blood samples from the collared elephants                  will be analyzed using DNA-fingerprinting techniques, to                        determine whether or not close genetic relatives are more likely                to call to each other and to coordinate their movements.                                                                                                        The researchers' long-term goals are to describe the structure of               elephants' acoustic communication system and the behavioral                     patterns it affects, both at the level of the individual and of                 the society.  The findings of this project will also contribute                 to conservation of severely threatened populations of elephants.                In Africa, the major cause of a disastrous decline (57% of East                 Africa's elephants have disappeared in the last 10 years) is                    potentially reversible, for it is related to a booming                          international trade in ivory that makes poaching extremely                      lucrative in countries where management is difficult.  Public                   education, including presentation of the results of this project,               will be important in the effort to stabilize the elephant                       populations.",
