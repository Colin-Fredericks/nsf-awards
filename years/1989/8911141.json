 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key element in improving the capacity of U.S. manufacturers                   to compete in world markets on both cost and quality is the                     modernization of production technologies, that is, the                          adoption of innovations in the processes by which goods are                     made and services are delivered.  This study examines the                       technical and organizational interdependencies among firms                      which are important to the diffusion of programmable                            automation, a process innovation with broad applicability to                    many manufacturing industries.  The study focuses on the                        system of inter-organizational linkages among three classes                     of economic organizations:  between equipment makers who                        manufacture programmable machines and machine tool users;                       among users; and between these users and the customer-firms                     to whom they are suppliers.  The goals of the study are : 1)                    to develop a richer theoretical understanding of the nature                     of and the conditions under which ties between organizations                    are important to the diffusion of programmable automation,                      and (2) to empirically test hypotheses about these                              relationships.  The researchers will draw on data collected                     in 1987 in a survey of manufacturing plants as well as                          results from a resurvey of these plants in 1990.  The                           findings from this study could be extended to process                           innovations more generally, since programmable automation is                    applicable to a broad spectrum of industries.  These results                    should contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms                         necessary to facilitate the more rapid and widespread                           diffusion of advanced automation technologies.",
