 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the Department of Biological Sciences, SUNY-Albany                provides funds for equipment to establish an advanced                           undergraduate laboratory course in molecular biology and to                     update the molecular biology laboratory exercises in the                        introductory biology sequence.  The molecular biology laboratory                course will be taken in conjunction with an already existing                    lecture course in Advanced Molecular Biology.  The laboratory                   exercises will introduce the students to recombinant DNA                        technology including:  isolation of plasmid DNA, restriction                    analyses of DNA, DNA blots, plasmid constructions, DNA sequence                 analysis and computer analyses of sequence information, gene                    cloning by both complementation and colony hybridization, TN 10                 mutagenesis, and maxi-cell analysis of plasmid encoded proteins.                The course will also serve to prepare students for independent                  research projects in molecular biology.  Also, a placement panel,               consisting of the course instructors, will be assembled to                      identify, encourage, and place promising students into reach                    labs.  In this way, it is hoped the problems presented by the                   large number of undergraduate biology majors which in the past                  has precluded a systematic approach to providing the and maximum                number of the best students with research opportunities will be                 overcome.  The grantee institution is matching this NSF award                   with funds from non-Federal sources.",
