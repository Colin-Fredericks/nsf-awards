 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a Research Experiences for                        Undergraduate Site and the University of Rhode Island.  Students                will be trained in anthropometry, osteopathology, tissue sample                 collection, trace metal and stable isotope analyses, and                        biological differentiation of skeletal samples as tools for                     studying adaptation to physical and cultural environments through               time.  Such experiences have proven useful to students majoring                 in anthropology, biology or ecology and interested in pursuing an               interdisciplinary approach towards a common objective--namely,                  paleodietary reconstruction.  Undergraduate student from these                  fields will work together as a team to realize this common goal.                They will acquire invaluable experience in the field and                        subsequently in the laboratory as the data are collected and                    analyzed.  The U.S. institutions involved will be collaborating                 with the University of Tarapaca in northern Chile.  The faculty                 team has established a well-defined research project for                        undergraduate training in paleonutrition reconstruction based on                well-preserved mummies and skeletal remains spanning the last                   8,000 years from northern Chile.  The students will learn how to                formulate and test hypotheses, they will learn new techniques and               be in a position to assess to value of these techniques for                     future studies.  Preparations are currently underway for a                      student symposium to be held at the Plains Conference in Sioux                  Falls, SD, October 1989.  Entitled \"REU Symposium: Diet                         Reconstruction and Paleoecology,\" this forum will allow the 1989                student team to present individual and joint papers summarizing                 their work  from the previous summer.",
