 "awd_abstract_narration": "The maintenance of high plasmid stability and efficient protein                 secretion are important for the enhancement of intracellular and                extracellular protein production in recombinant Saccharomyces                   cerevisiae.  A major objective of the research outlined in this                 proposal is to study plasmid stability and cloned gene expression  in           complex media.  With the proper choice of a plasmid, selection for              plasmid-containing cells occurs regardless of the nutrient medium used.         A detailed experimental plan has been described, focusing on the effects        of medium enrichment on cloned gene product synthesis.  The results of          the research will indicate the potential of autoselection systems for           the production of heterologous proteins.                                                                                                                        Another primary emphasis of the proposed work is protein secretion.             Various genetic and environmental factors will be manipulated to                determine their influence on the efficiency of protein secretion.  In           particular, the influence of promoter strength and transcription rate,          the induction of protein secretion, and secretion in complex media will         be investigated.                                                                                                                                                For both areas of research, the initial work will be experimental. It is        anticipated that certain avenues of research will be amenable to kinetic        modeling.",
