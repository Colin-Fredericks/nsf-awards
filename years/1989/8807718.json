 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Larrabee is developing and using three different structural                 probe techniques to study the coupled binuclear copper sites in                 hemocyanin, tyrosinase and laccase.  These probes are:  1)                      substitution of other metals for copper followed by uv/vis, CD                  and MCD spectral studies; 2) binding of exogenous ligands to the                native and metal substituted proteins, followed by spectral                     studies, and 3) infrared spectroscopy of the internal vibrational               modes of bound exogenous ligands.                                                                                                                               Coupled binuclear copper is found at the active site of a variety               of proteins of living systems from fungi to humans.  These                      proteins are involved in oxygen transport (hemocyanins) or in                   activation of dioxygen (tyrosine, laccase).  Because of the large               size and complexity of these proteins the exact structures of                   their active sites are unknown.  Most of our knowledge of these                 structures has developed through the study of their spectroscopic               properties.",
