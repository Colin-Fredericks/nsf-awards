 "awd_abstract_narration": "The core of this study involves the characterization of leaf                    developmental mutants in maize. Two have been cloned via                        transposon-tagging. The questions addressed in this proposal are:               1.Are the leaf development mutants under study altered in                       cellular age-identity, as hypothesized, or in position-identity?                Problems of developmental time-keeping are especially                           approachable in plants. 2. Does the animal concept of                           developmental compartments apply to plants? Dr. Freeling will                   address this question using a dominant dwarf in genetic mosaic                  studies. 3. Are the provascular cells the primary inducers of                   other leaf cell fates? Is the epidermis an information \"blank                   sheet\" until induced to differentiate into particular cell types?               Dr. Freeling will approach these two related question using                     detailed vein lineage maps, periclinal chimeric analyses, and                   mutants that fail to anastomose intermediate veins.                             %%%                                                                             These studies will establish the maize leaf as a powerful                       developmental system amenable to mutant analysis as well as for                 cell biological, and embryological studies. The approach to the                 mutants at these levels will provide a context for the on-going                 studies on the molecular descriptions of developmental gene                     regulation.",
