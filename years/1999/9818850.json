 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary, international research workshop will address how recent advances in Geography, including GIS and remote sensing techniques, environmental modeling, and regional political ecology, can be integrated in future research on African environmental change. The focus will be on developing integrative research efforts on African environments utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. By linking new and ever-expanding technological capabilities and physical-systems-modeling techniques available to geographers with a theoretically informed and practical sensitivity to the issues of regional political ecology, better development policies and research approaches can be generated at academic, government and grassroots levels. Participation includes representatives from US research universities, universities in Africa and Europe, and African government environmental monitoring institutions. The immediate product of the workshop will be an edited volume including the research presentations of the participants. The workshop will also generate as many as three separate proposals to the NSF for multi-investigator, interdisciplinary research on environmental change and environmental protection in Africa.\r\n",
