 "awd_abstract_narration": "In animals, the steroid hormones have long been recognized as playing important roles in regulating many physiological processes, from calcium balance to growth and development.  Similarly, vitamin A and its hormone-like derivatives, the retinoids, are essential for normal development.  Dietary vitamin A deficiencies in humans can lead to sterility, loss of vision and skin pathologies.  Retinoid excess can be equally damaging, causing profound deformities in developing embryos.  It has recently become clear that both steroids and retinoids play a major role during invertebrate animal development, serving as signaling molecules which influence the processes that result in normal body shape and tissue differentiation.  The basic mechanisms through which steroids and retinoids exert their physiological effects remain unclear.  This research will examine the type and distribution of signaling molecules present during the growth cycle of the fiddler crab, and investigate how signaling molecules interact with specific cell receptor proteins to regulate gene expression in a special type of development-regenerating crustacean limbs; a system amenable to experimental manipulation. \r\n\r\nRetinoids and steroids are known to modulate gene expression through the use of specific cellular receptor.  The amount and type of receptor that may be present in a given cell is too small to measure directly.  Recombinant DNA techniques, however, can be used to develop molecular probes that can mark the presence of specific receptors at the subcellular level, and microbes can be engineered to produce large amounts of receptor protein.  These methodologies will be employed to detect which cells contain receptors, and by inference, identify particular cells that may be responding to steroid/retinoid signaling.  The recombinant proteins will also be used to examine the physical characteristics of the receptors, such as their ability to bind to specific signaling molecules and gene sequences.\r\n\r\nThe regeneration of limbs must occur in concert with the animal's growth and reproductive activities.  How a \"common\" signal might modulate these varied physiological events is unclear.  Knowledge of the type and amounts of signaling molecules present at specific stages of growth and regeneration, coupled with information on the physical properties and distribution of receptors, will elaborate the role of steroid/retinoid signaling and help us to better understand the evolution of basic developmental processes.\r\n",
