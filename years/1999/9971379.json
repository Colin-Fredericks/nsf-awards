 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the study of the response of complex \r\nobjects and materials to electromagnetic radiation. In particular, \r\ntheoretical and computational advances are projected in the solution \r\nof classical problems of wave scattering by obstacles and interfaces. \r\nSuch progress will stem from the further development of a new approach \r\nto these problems, based on high-order perturbation and analytic \r\ncontinuation techniques, that was previously introduced by the principal \r\ninvestigator (PI) and which has been proved to deliver very accurate\r\nresults for a variety of configurations. The investigations to be \r\ncarried out relate to the analysis and possible improvement of each of \r\nthe elements that combined to produce these highly precise calculations \r\nand, in particular, with their influence on the applicability and \r\naccuracy of the resulting numerical codes. Concurrent with this effort \r\non the electromagnetic return of macroscopic objects, the PI will work \r\nto enhance his recently devised algorithms for the simulation of \r\nelectrically conducting and/or magnetically permeable microscopic \r\nparticulate suspensions, by incorporating a variety of nonlinear \r\nhydrodynamic and electromagnetic effects.\r\n\r\nThe generation, control and detection of electromagnetic radiation has\r\nbeen, and continues to be, at the core of innumerable engineering and \r\ntechnological advances in areas ranging from radar and tomography to \r\noptical systems, communications and \"smart\" materials. Historically, \r\nmost of these advances have resulted from expansive experimentation \r\nguided more by intuition and physical insight than by mathematical \r\nmodeling and computations. Recently, as computers grew more powerful, \r\nit became natural to attempt to incorporate them into design processes, \r\nand the search for fast, accurate and reliable algorithms to numerically \r\nsolve sophisticated models turned into one of science's central problems.\r\nThis project revolves around this search as it seeks to enhance currently \r\navailable techniques for the determination of the electromagnetic \r\nsignatures of large objects and microscopic composite dispersions. \r\nParticular areas of application where the methods to be developed here \r\nare expected to have a direct impact include target recognition and the \r\ndesign of advanced controllable (electro and magnetorheological) fluids.\r\n\r\n",
