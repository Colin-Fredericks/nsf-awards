Using techniques that originated from modern statistical physics (spin glasses and disordered systems); they have been trying to explore this central problem in biology.\r\nDuring the last meeting of the American Physical Society (APS) in March of 1998, several Divisions of the APS partially addressed the protein folding problem at the theoretical level. Discussions were very active and the interest in this problem was noticeable. This is a very positive advance for biophysics. The weakness of the meeting was the lack of a strong connection with experiments. Such a connection is vital to advance these new theoretical approaches. To highlight the need for the connection between experiments and theoretical approaches and to present successful examples of how that can be achieved is the goal of this symposium.\r\nThe general meeting of the American Physical Society is 1999 will mark its centennial celebration. This meeting will highlight the advances in physics over the last century. As part of this meeting there will be a Nobel Laureate Exhibit and Luncheon where more than 40 Nobel Prize winners have been invited to participate. Vice-president Al Gore has also been invited to this event. All Divisions of the APS have been invited to organize symposia where the highlights of their contribution to Physics will be presented, and where research at the frontier of the field is presented. It is very important that biophysics shows its natural strength and need to grow during this event.  This conference bridges the gap between theory and experiments, as discussed above. This event will consist of a symposium in the morning, followed by a contributed section in the afternoon. The topic will be \"Contrasting New Theories of Protein Folding with Experiments.\" The American Physical Society community will substantially benefit by being exposed to this approach of developing biophysics. This meeting will happen in Atlanta during the week of 20-26 March of 1999.\r\n\r\n",
