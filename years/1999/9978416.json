Together, the conference and monograph will assist policymakers to develop viable and appropriate large-scale assessment systems. The last conference on assessment was held four years ago, and the field has undergone some significant changes in that time.  \r\n\r\nSessions will address the current state of the art in research and implementation, including:  criteria for evaluating the costs of different assessment measures and policies; finds on the selection of appropriate instruments; uses of test results; and practical considerations in implementing large-scale assessments (including the use of performance measures).  Participants will also have an opportunity to hear from developers and to see demonstrations of more than a dozen commercial and non-commercial assessment instruments.  There will also be small workshops on test design and scoring and reporting results.\r\n\r\nRather than prepare a proceedings from the meeting, RAND will prepare a monograph devoted to assessment issues.  This can be widely distributed to principal investigators and others interested in assessment issues.  The monograph will follow the format of the Foundations series -- that is, it will be written for a general audience.  Possible topics include criteria for evaluating measures and testing strategies and policies, research findings on designing assessments, lessons from the field in conducting large-scale assessments, the use of computer-based assessments, and an annotated bibliography of further readings.\r\n",
