Though the number of galactic mergers has declined with time, a few such mergers are still occurring and offer us valuable clues to past evolutionary processes.  Dr. Schweizer is determining the dates of ancient and recent merger events in nearby galaxies.  Discoveries of young globular star clusters apparently formed during mergers have made possible a new method for dating the merger events themselves.  Because of the coeval stars, globular clusters are more easily dated than whole galaxies.  Dr. Schweizer is conducting six projects: (1) an analysis of images of six merger galaxies to search young to intermediate age globular clusters in them; (2) establish a globular cluster chronology; (3) determine the large scale spatial distribution of the clusters; (4) measure metallicities and ages of these clusters; (5) map the velocities of the stars and gas in three merger galaxies to determine the merger dynamics; and (6) search for a remnant galactic wind and possible large scale shock fronts in the merger remnant NGC 7252.  These projects address key questions on the origins of galaxies, the ages and metallicities of globular clusters in them, the formation of oddly rotating cores in merger remnants, and the fate of gas during mergers.  \r\n",
