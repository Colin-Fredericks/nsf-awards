To address these two important issues, the Houston LSAMP will create and maintain a challenging, yet nurturing learning environment in which students who work hard will have every opportunity to succeed.  The Alliance will promote and capitalize on industry and university participation to stimulate the interest of university undergraduates in SMET careers and graduate education and provide the resources, academic support, and environment for them to successfully complete their degrees and transition to careers or graduate school.  Financial support from NSF funds, institutional resources, and corporate partnerships will play a critical role in assuring that students are not diverted from their goals by employment unrelated to their fields of study.  Finally, Houston LSAMP leadership will continue to improve the integration among participating institutions, government agencies and industry partners and expand the network of participants to sustain the program indefinitely beyond the five-year term of an NSF award.\r\n\r\n",
