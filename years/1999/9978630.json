 "awd_abstract_narration": "***\r\n9978630\r\nFrost\r\nA review of the technical design methods for a range of geotechnical\r\nstructures will confirm that, although many of these systems rely on the\r\ninterface strength between soil and man-made construction materials to\r\nprovide the necessary load resisting forces, rarely are measurements made\r\nto directly determine the interface strength characteristics.  Instead,\r\ninterface strength parameters are either estimated empirically from other\r\nmeasures of strength by applying various correlation and/or correction\r\nfactors or they are interpreted through back-analysis of load tests.  For\r\nexample, many prominent direct CPT pile design methods relate the measured\r\nCPT tip resistance to the unit shaft capacity of the pile through one or\r\nmore correlation factors.  Similar approaches are taken in determining the\r\ncapacity of tie-back anchor systems, in estimating the friction acting on\r\npipes during micro-tunneling, and in estimating the friction between\r\nbackfill soils and sheet piles or other retaining structures.  \r\n\r\nWhy have these various design procedures relied on empiricism and\r\nback-analysis rather than direct measurement of relevant properties?  The\r\nanswer is simply that until very recently, while recognized as a\r\nsignificant factor in the strength of interfaces, the technology and\r\nmethods to quantitatively evaluate the surface roughness of civil\r\nengineering construction materials at relevant scales was not available.\r\nFortunately, driven by the need to quantify surface characteristics of\r\nmaterials in other engineering disciplines, the technology and equipment is\r\nnow available.  This project seeks to exploit this opportunity by applying\r\nthis technology to geotechnical interfaces and thereby providing the basis\r\nto revolutionize how pile foundations and other earth structure systems are\r\ndesigned and constructed.  \r\n\r\nThis project is to develop and evaluate a multi-friction sleeve attachment\r\nto the cone penetrometer (CPT) to permit direct in situ measurement of the\r\nrelationship between interface strength and surface roughness. Recent\r\nresearch has successfully quantified the relationship between interface\r\nstrength and surface roughness in the laboratory.  The opportunity now\r\nexists to transfer this knowledge to an in-situ test.  Through measurement\r\nof the loads transmitted to multiple friction sleeves of increasing\r\nroughness assembled in series, the quantitative relationship between\r\ninterface friction and surface roughness can be measured.  This will result\r\nin the ability to directly measure the insitu interface strength, thereby\r\nopening the opportunity to revolutionize the design concepts, materials,\r\nmethods and processes used in foundations, retaining structures, and\r\nmicro-tunnels.\r\n\r\nThe proposal outlines a series of tasks ranging from laboratory\r\nexperimentation, numerical analysis, calibration chamber testing, to\r\nfull-scale field testing to ensure that the design of the proposed\r\nattachment is based on a solid fundamental understanding of the interaction\r\nof the penetrometer with the surrounding soil. It is noted that the\r\nproposed approach is not to alter existing cone penetrometer design but to\r\nadd an attachment that offers new capability for site characterization. The\r\ninterface friction measurements made with the device can be complemented by\r\neither pressuremeter or dilatometer measurements so that reliable estimates\r\nof lateral stress conditions are available for the pile capacity prediction\r\nprocedures to be developed as part of this study. \r\n***\r\n",
