 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Northern Illinois University will acquire a powder X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:  1) characterization of thin films of magneto-resistant materials; 2) structure-property relationships of nanograin colossal magnetoresistant films by deposition of aqueousacetate solution (DAAS) technique; 3) identification of powder samples and thin films of intermetallic materials; 4) chemical modification of layered intermetallic materials as quantum well structures; 5) carborane compounds; 6) synthesis and characterization of metallacarboranes; 7) design and synthesis of chiral diaryldiselenides; and 8) characterization and use as asymmetric catalysts in reduction of prochiral radicals. \r\n\r\nThe X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.  This instrument will have an impact on the research of four groups in the areas of materials science and synthetic chemistry.  In addition, students will have hands-on access for research purposes and in the classroom setting.  \r\n\r\n",
