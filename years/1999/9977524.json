 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to improve multiparty communication on the Internet by applying models\r\nand methodology from the fields of graph theory and parallel and distributed computing.  Multiparty\r\ncommunication refers to any type of information exchange among a group of participants, including\r\nconferences, advertising, electronic voting, remote monitoring, and meta-computing.\r\nMulticast, or one-to-many communication, has received the most attention from network proto-\r\ncol designers and has been implemented on a subset of the Internet known as the MBone.  Several\r\nobstacles to the universal deployment of multicast remain, such as high cost and lack of robustness.\r\nMoreover, some multiparty applications are not able to operate, or operate less efficiently, because\r\nmulticast is a poor match for their style of communication.  Large-scale electronic voting, for exam-\r\nple, could use a many-to-one network service, with balloting results partially tabulated on the way\r\nto a central reporting service.\r\n     Research from the fields of graph theory and parallel and distributed computing has solved many\r\nof these problems, albeit for environments that differ greatly from that of the Internet.  The key to\r\napplying these results to Internet protocols is the use of a virtual topology that maps a theoretical\r\nsubstructure onto the physical network.  As with the MBone, the links in the virtual topology could\r\nconsist of some physical links and some virtual links implemented by encapsulation tunnels.\r\nThe proposed research first addresses limitations in current multicast routing protocols.  The researchers\r\npropose to investigate the use of spanners as a virtual topology for densely-populated multicast\r\ngroups, thus improving the efficiency of the periodic ooding used in this domain.  For sparsely-\r\npopulated groups, we propose to apply hypercube message passing algorithms used in parallel\r\ncomputation to the design of a more efficient and fault-tolerant multicast protocol. The researchers then plan\r\nto apply the techniques used for multicast virtual topologies to other multiparty communication\r\nparadigms. The researchers have identified promising research directions for reduction (many-to-one), subcast (one-to-some), and multi-source multicast (few-to-many).\r\n     The project will progress in three main stages: analysis, protocol design and evaluation.  The\r\nanalysis stage is intended to identify virtual topologies that are good candidates for multiparty com-\r\nmunication protocols.  The analysis will include definition of formal models of the virtual topologies\r\nused, definition of appropriate metrics and statistical evaluation of random samples of the topologies,\r\nand discussion of complexity status of the relevant exact and approximate optimization problems.\r\nThe protocol design stage will build on our analysis by using virtual topologies as the basis for\r\ncommunication protocols.  Our emphasis will be on protocols that are feasible and practical to\r\nimplement and will be based on simulation studies of the static properties of proposed graph struc-\r\ntures.  Evaluation of the new protocols will utilize dynamic simulation to look at traffic capacities,\r\ndelay, and fault tolerance recovery. Eventually, the developed protocols will be implemented and\r\nevaluated on a network testbed built with prior NSF support.\r\n     The major contributions of this work will be a methodology for applying virtual topologies to\r\nInternet protocol design, formal models for these topologies, and new protocols for multicast rout-\r\ning, reduction, and other communication paradigms.  Further outcomes of our work will include\r\na database of topologies used in our simulations, methods for modeling dynamic group member-\r\nship and group distribution, and techniques for evaluation of fault tolerance properties of virtual\r\ntopologies and protocols.  The  contributions to education will consist of training of graduate and\r\nundergraduate students in network theory and engineering, and development and dissemination of\r\ncurriculum materials for the design and evaluation of multiparty communication protocols.",
