A comprehensive set of experiments is planned in which the chronological sequence of drop spreading is synchronized with output from a sensitive calorimeter.  Visual data are used to establish the mobility relationship, a relationship between contact angle and triple line speed, for a particular material system.  Calorimetry data provide information on the types of phase changes and reaction phenomena (such as dissolution) that occur as the spreading progresses.  This approach should permit the first correlations between visual wetting data, phase changes and reactions for metal/metal systems.  Direct observations of solder spreading, wetting and reactions with metals are correlated with structural characterizations of the samples cooled to room temperature, or of similar samples quenched to room temperature at various times during the run.  These data provide powerful tests of models for reactive spreading.  Using these tests, quantitative mathematical models of solder wetting of metallic substrates with and without reaction between the substrate and solder are developed.  These computational models, ranging from one-dimensional diffusion to a two-dimensional flow model with capillary effects and multi-component transport, provide better fundamental understanding and the ability to treat different material systems whose requisite physicochemical properties are known.  Ultimately, the computational model will permit creation of a design tool that can be used to analyze new solder systems.\r\n%%%\r\nAlthough soldering has become a critical, widespread process in electronics manufacturing, solder wetting and soldering reactions are poorly understood.  Improved understanding is needed to develop new soldering procedures particularly at smaller length scales. This will allow the industry to meet new challenges, including stricter environmental regulations on the material constituents of solder alloys and the demand for the use of microelectronic devices in harsh surroundings.\r\n***\r\n",
