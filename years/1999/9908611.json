Collaborators are Jagadeesh Moodera of the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ratnamala Chatterjee, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.  This research will use controlled radiation damage to study the influence of defects on spin dependent transport.  The study will fill a major gap in the understanding of the role of defect scattering in producing giant magnetorresistance in metallic multilayers and magnetic tunnel junctions.  In addition to obtaining fundamental knowledge in incompletely understood areas of magnetism, it can lead to better magnetic materials for application.\r\n\r\nScope:  The US PI is an acknowledged leader in thin film magnetism, superconductivity and tunneling research.  His work has frequently lead to discovery.  Moodera won the IBM Research Partnership Award for three consecutive years.  The Indian co-PI did postdoctoral studies at MIT and has received numerous awards for research and teaching.  The project brings together complimentary expertise, facilities and involves students at both institutions.\r\n",
