 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tens of millions of dollars are lost each year due to accidents in chemical and other laboratories, not to mention the accompanying pain and suffering. University laboratories are worse than industrial laboratories, both because the rate of accidents is much higher and because this is the training ground at which generations of future scientists learn their unsafe laboratory skills.\r\n\r\nThese accidents continue to occur in spite of extensive safety training programs already in place. One contributing factor is that people only have a limited memory and respect for written rules, and over time tend to either forget their safety training or become complacent about safety rules.\r\n\r\nExperience has a much greater impact on the human memory than written text, and therefore people who have experienced laboratory accidents are more likely to remember those experiences, and follow safe laboratory practices as a result, than those who have not. Obviously, however, the idea of deliberately causing accidents in order to improve safety is not an acceptable solution.\r\n\r\nVirtual Reality, VR, is a computer interface designed to deliver highly realistic \"experiences\" that are (ideally) indistinguishable from the real thing. Although this ideal has not yet been achieved, (and probably never will be), many high-end VR simulations are extremely believable, and even low-end systems produce experiences having a much greater impact on the user than written text.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a series of VR-based laboratory accidents that give users valuable experience in the safety of their homes, offices, and computing laboratories. These modules graphically illustrate the consequences of disregarding safety rules, using the high impact medium of virtual reality. A World Wide Web framework provides for on-line VRML simulations, extensive support materials, and fast distribution of more rigorous executable programs. Formative and summative evaluations and site testing will determine the optimal effectiveness of virtual accidents for laboratory safety, in order to guide their development and eventual implementation.  The modules in the form of CD-ROMs will be distributed to a variety of schools at the end of the project.\r\n",
