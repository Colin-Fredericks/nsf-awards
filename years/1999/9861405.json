 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861405\r\n\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop novel photonic networks supporting optically-powered Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) arrays for applications requiring numerous sensors and actuators.  This research addresses the enormous challenge for interrogating, activating and controlling all microdevices to improve health monitoring of smart structures.  The proposed networks will be implemented with wavelength-division-multiplexed, fiber-optic circuits in architectural configurations, well-suited to the project goal.  MEMS arrays have been fabricated for real-time measurement of shear-stress distribution.  With the increase in number of microdevices employed in a single structure, the problem remains a lack of high-capacity interconnection system.  Further problems include operation in electrically-noisy and potentially-explosive environments.  The proposed photonic networks offer ultra high capacity, electromagnetic  interference immunity, electrical passivity, and expandability.  Because of increasing need for networked microdevices and recent advances in MEMS, the time is ripe to advance the research toward commercialization.  The firm is in a unique position to undertake this program because of (a) the pioneering history of its staff and team (Stanford, UC Berkeley, UCLA) in the subject, and (b) its recent related device technology advancements.  Phase I will design, fabricate and test microdevice fiber bus interfacing and powering, as wells as design an expandable, photonically networked, multiplexed, multiple microsensor, MEMS arrays for Phase II application-specific implementation.\r\n     MEMS is predicted to be a $100 billion market by the year 2000.  Commercial applications of the proposed photonically interconnected MEMS array networks include civil, mechanical, aerospace, chemical and marine engineering, particularly monitoring and control of smart structures by microsensors (shear stress, pressure, temperature, strain, gas, liquid level, fluid flow, etc.) and microactuators for mechanical systems, electrical power plants, automobiles, materials processing (e.g., semiconductor), and medical devices.  If successful, the resulting networks can accommodate MEMS arrays on flexible substrates in a smart skin configuration for 3 D measurements on curved surfaces.  There is also market potential in fields such as communications.  Potential industrial partners have expressed interest in commercial development.\r\n",
