 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will complete the research and initiate the implementation of a software system that can efficiently create 3D polygonal mesh surface models of anatomical structures from 2D section data such as CT, MRI, ultrasound and cryosections. The software system will be integrated onto single platform with a semi-automated segmentation module, a 3D model-based registration module, an automatic connectivity triangulation module and a post-processing system. The integration of these modules will provide a new and innovative way to capture and deliver expert knowledge for assisting in the creation of highly accurate 3D surface anatomical models. \r\n     3D polygonal mesh models of anatomical structures are used by diverse groups such as researchers, educators, medical professionals, diagnosticians, multimedia publishers, simulation design specialists, and entertainment and gaming industry engineers. This software would allow these diverse groups to efficiently create their own models at a more reasonable price and at a much faster rate than is currently possible\r\n",
