The operator space theory is  a natural quantization of Banach space theory.  The major difference between operator spaces and Banach spaces is that one considers  operator matrix norms and  completely bounded maps in the  category of operator spaces. In 1987, the PI succeeded in formulating an axiomatization of operator spaces by matrix norms.  Since then, a lot of progress has been made in this area.  In this proposal, the PI plans to continue his research in this direction and proposes  the following research topics:\r\n(1)  investigate the  local structure of the operator preduals of von Neumann algebras and the operator duals of $C^*$-algebras; (2) investigate the local structure on $C^*$-algebras and von Neumann algebras; (3) investigate the geometric structure of matrix unit balls of operator spaces;\r\n(4)  investigate the application to locally compact quantum groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most profound distinction between classical and quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's principle that one must represent the basic variables of physics by operators rather than functions. The work of  J. von Neumann emphasized that it is important to pursue the \"quantized\" forms of mathematics.  Collaborating with F.J. Murray, von Neumann  succeeded in quantizing integration theory during the 1940's.  Since then, mathematicians have tried to quantize many other areas of mathematics such as topology, differential geometry, analysis and probability theory.  The theory of operator spaces is a natural quantization of functional analysis, or more precisely, a natural quantization of Banach space theory.  This is a recently developed promising research area in modern analysis.  The PI and his colleagues have established the foundation of this area.  They have also discovered some  far-reaching applications of operator space theory to related areas in mathematics such as operator algebras, non-commutative harmonic analysis, Kac algebras  and locally compact quantum groups.  The PI plans to continue his research in this direction and plans to explore a much broarder range of applications.\r\n\r\n",
