 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a grant supported by Experimental Physical Chemistry Program under the GOALI initiative, A. Welford Castleman of the Pennsylvania State University will perform studies that aim to provide a scientific basis for tailoring the design of transition metal oxide catalysts which will be effective in the selective activation of carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, and to determine the properties necessary to promote oxygen-transfer reactions with several classes of organic molecules. Guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometry techniques will be employed in order to understand the catalytic activity of vanadium, niobium, and tantalum oxide cluster ions.  The objectives are to investigate the influence of stoichiometry, size, structure, ionization potentials, charge, and oxidation state on the transfer of oxygen atoms to various organic molecules as well as C-C and C-H bond activation, and to gain insights into the mechanisms of these reactions.  Additionally, the structures of metal oxide clusters will be probed further using collision-induced dissociation techniques.  Comparisons of these results with related condensed phase reactions will lead to improved understanding of the interaction of reactant species with active sites of catalytic surfaces.  Students from the PI group will pursue related research in collaboration with industry scientists from DuPont Central Research and Development who have broad experience in solid state chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis.  New findings from the gas phase studies will be implemented in exploring materials that have promise for development as new catalysts. \r\n\r\nA catalyst causes changes in a chemical reaction process, such as increasing its rate or causing different end products to be produced, while the catalyst itself remains chemically unaltered at the end.  Catalysis continues to have an enormous impact on the economy, yet the ability to design catalysts that will lead to highly selective formation of desired products with minimal environmental effect is still rudimentary. Transition metal oxides are becoming increasingly important as catalysts because they enable useful reactions and are cost efficient and often environmentally benign. This academic/industrial collaboration is expected to provide insights that will ultimately lead to the development of improved catalysts. \r\n\r\n",
