The body of knowledge that is included ranges from programming to ethics and is being threaded through several undergraduate courses rather than into a single monolithic course in computer security.  The project packages specific research efforts into small lessons, or modules, that can be easily integrated into a wide range of courses.  Each module is accompanied by an assessment piece and dissemination is accomplished by collaboration through the Web and by distribution of CD-ROMs that contain interactive lessons.  The PIs are recognized for their innovations in computer security education and the Information Systems Security Laboratory (of which the PIs are a part) at the institution that has been designated by the National Security Agency as one of their seven Centers of Excellence in Information Assurance Education.  This project complements the research support of NSF in this important area of computer security.\r\n",
