 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a coupled optimization and simulation risk management model for investigating the relationships between human health risk and corrective action design under conditions of uncertainty.  The methodology will identify optimal risk-based corrective action (RBCA) design options ranging from natural attenuation to engineered plume control and remediation, as well as combinations of these approaches. Theoretical advancements for improving computational efficiency of the model will be explored so that large-scale field sites can be considered.  A noisy genetic algorithm will be coupled with comprehensive flow and fate and transport simulation models called Modflow and RT3D.  Noisy genetic algorithms are similar to genetic algorithms, but the fitness (worth) of each candidate solution is evaluated through sampling from probability distributions.  For this application, probability distributions represent uncertainty in spatially-variable hydraulic conductivity measurements and variability in parameters used to estimate human health risks.  Methods for improving computational efficiency of the model to be investigated include developing efficient and effective sampling strategies, testing the implications of sampling tolerance on grid approximations in the numerical models and investigating the performance of an injection island genetic algorithm that uses multiple populations of solutions at multiple resolutions to efficiently identify and fine-tune strong solutions.  The proposed work is expected to result in a valuable risk management tool for both regulators and the regulated community, identifying risk reduction strategies that are both cost-effective and sufficiently protective of human health.",
