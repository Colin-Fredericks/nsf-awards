 "awd_abstract_narration": "In integrated services wireless networks, geographically distributed heterogeneous applications must share a common wireless channel.  To coordinate the sharing of the transmission resources, a multiple access   protocol such as time-division multiple access (TDMA) or code-division multiple access (CDMA) is required. To control QoS in an integrated services network, usually both call admission and resource management   (scheduling  at the packet level) among  the admitted calls are needed.\r\n\r\nAt call admission, it must first be determined if there exists a slot allocation (as in the case of TDMA) or power management (as in case of CDMA) policy that can deliver a target QoS  to each application in the\r\nnetwork.   To answer this question, the region of achievable QoS (set of  performance  vectors that  can  be  delivered under any admissible policy) needs to be identified.  The region of achievable QoS will depend on  the underlying channel conditions and the multiple access technology.  Each access technology has its inherent advantages and disadvantages in combating the effects of the wireless channel and in its ease of accommodating variable rate service while delivering diverse QoS requirements.  The determination of the region of achievable QoS leads to the development of call admission and scheduling functions.\r\n\r\nThe PI has been conducting research in the area of integrated services over wireless networks for the past  five years  and now proposes to translate some of his and others prior research into viable technology\r\nand educational tools through the development of an integrated services wireless network (ISWN) test-bed.   The ISWN project is multifaceted in the sense that it contains educational, development, and research components.  The project will be implemented in three phases:  system design and specification, development  of novel approaches to support multi-media traffic and software implementation in an operational system.\r\n\r\n",
