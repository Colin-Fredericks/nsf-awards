The use of flexible chain models for polymers, e.g., the freely-jointed chain model, the bead-string or its continuous version of the gaussian model, have contributed considerably to our current understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of polymers.   Many polymer systems, especially biopolymers such as DNA and actin filaments, and main-chain liquid-crystalline polymers, require that the stiffness of the polymer chain be taken into account explicitly.  A number of fundamental issues will be addressed in the static and dynamic properties of semiflexible polymers.  These include: (1) understanding the single chain dynamics of a semiflexible polymer; (2) understanding the conformation and dynamics of a semiflexible chain in a nematic field, with a focus on multiple hairpins; and, (3) understanding the phase behavior, fluctuations and instabilities in nematic semiflexible polymer solutions.  \r\n\r\nWhile the main focus of this work is understanding of the fundamental physics of semiflexible polymers, the results will also be highly relevant in engineering applications.  For example, the study of chain dynamics includes calculating the stress of a polymer under various steady flow conditions and the stress relaxation for a deformed chain.  These results will enable us to predict the constitutive behavior of polymer melts and solutions in steady flows as well as their viscoelastic properties.  Likewise, one of the problems to be addressed in this research, namely the banding instability in sheared multi-chain liquid crystals, has important consequences in the processing of these materials such as in fiber drawing and injection molding.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports theoretical research on the statistical mechanics of polymers.
