 "awd_abstract_narration": "9978555\r\nMeindl\r\nEarly XXI century opportunities for multi-trillion transistor chips or terascale integration (TSI) engaging 100-10 nanometer (nm) technology will be governed by a hierarchy of physical limits whose five levels can be codified as: 1) fundamental, 2) material, 3) device, 4) circuit and 5) system. The key objective of the proposed research is to explore the novel hypothesis that in the era of TSI, the most critical constraints of this hierarchy will be imposed by a dominant subset of inescapable intrinsic stochastic limits that previously have been of little consequence and therefore very largely neglected.\r\n\r\nIntrinsic stochastic limits on TSI emerge from two independent root causes. The first is random placement of dopant atoms in the channel region of MOSFETs; the second is the stochastic nature of the interconnect length distribution of a random logic network. The principal methods to be engaged in the proposed research are derivation of compact models that describe: 1) the stochastic distributions of key MOSFET parameters, such as threshold voltage, resulting from random dopant atom placement and 2) the complete stochastic interconnect latency distribution resulting from random logic circuit placement. Combining these two stochastic distributions enables a projection of the intrinsic limits that will govern the ultimate progress of TSI.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the proposed activity to the advancement of knowledge and education is that the research will provide a unique theoretical basis for projecting the terminal phase of the most powerful driving force of the most important technological and economic advance of the XX century.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
