The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Donna R. Francis with support for twelve months to work with Dr. Ian R. Walker at Okanagan University College in Kelowna, British Columbia.\r\nDr. Francis will study long-term climate dynamics in the Canadian Artic.  She will develop a novel proxy record for climate change through the study of aquatic insect fossils (chironomid remains) recovered from drill cores to infer temperature. Chironomid studies are a very useful proxy climate indicator and this research will extend and further develop their application.  The analysis of long cores (85,000 years) from Baffin Island will help understand the timing and extent of glacial events.\r\nDr. Walker has been working with chironomidae for 20 years and has worked to develop this group into a significant tool for Quaternary environmental reconstructions.  He has developed a chironomid palaeotemperature inference model, which will benefit this research project.\r\n***\r\n",
