 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is transferring the reforms in undergraduate chemistry education to the community college.  Five southwestern community colleges - Fullerton College in California, Community College of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas, Nevada, Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute in New Mexico, City College of San Francisco in California, and Montgomery College in Houston, Texas - have formed the FLASH consortium.  With a combined enrollment of over 131,000, FLASH impacts almost 5000 first-year chemistry students per year.  Because our community colleges admit all applicants, many students are under-prepared, lacking even basic skills in math and writing, and they often cannot succeed in chemistry courses.  These students are clearly \"at risk,\" and steps are needed to help them.  This project is adopting and adapting the methodology of the Molecular Science curriculum project along with relevant materials from this and other projects of the NSF Systemic Changes in the Undergraduate Chemistry Curriculum Initiative.  FLASH believes students may learn better in a technology-mediated, student-centered learning environment in which students are active learners and cooperative learning is supported.  We are setting up Chemistry Learning and Support Studio (CLASS) rooms at our respective colleges to make the actual processs of studying chemistry more engaging and interesting.  The Web-deliverable nature of many of the materials allows use not only in on-campus facilities but anywhere students have access to the Internet.  We assist even the most under-prepared students to become more competitive as undergraduates and, ultimately, in their careers.  This project helps our students and has the potential to serve as a model for every community college.",
