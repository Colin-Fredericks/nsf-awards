Bleher\r\n\r\nAbstract: Bleher's project focuses on basic problems in the theory of random matrices and random polynomials, and on related problems in the theory of quantum chaos and statistical mechanics. The unifying theme of these problems is a number of different conjectures about universality. The major topics of investigation include: (i) universality of the double scaling limit in random matrix models near critical and multicritical points, its relation to integrable hierarchies and Painleve transcendents, and applications of random matrix models; (ii) universality and scaling for random sections of powers of positive line bundles, especially SU(m+1)-polynomials and universality of eigenstates statistics in the theory of  quantum chaos; (iii) almost periodicity of the spectral function  for integrable systems in quantum mechanics, trace formulae, and probability distribution of the error function; (iv) the Thouless effect and superpolynomial scaling in classical  spin systems with long-range interaction.\r\n\r\nThe concept of scaling and universality is a fundamental principle in different theories of modern mathematics and physics, from probability theory to the physical theory of quantum chaos, and from mathematical analysis to the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena in statistical physics. In rough terms, the concept of universality states that many mathematical and physical phenomena display remarkable universal features on the scale of very small or very large distances. The major goal of the current project is to consolidate the different concepts of universality that arise in various contexts and, in particular, to investigate scaling and universality in mathematical theories of random matrices and random polynomials with a view toward applications to the theory of quantum chaos and to statistical physics. This award is jointly funded by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Mathematical Physics Program in the Division of Physics.\r\n",
