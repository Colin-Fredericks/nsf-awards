That storm passed directly over the area in which I have been studying groundwater geochemistry and hydrogeology for several years.  The samples collected will be analyzed for their isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen, and the results will be compared with measurements on samples collected in 1996 and (mostly) in 1997 (Perry et al, 1997).  The principal objective of this study is to compare the isotopic composition of pairs of deep and shallow groundwater samples.  As many sampling sites as possible will be localities that have been sampled previously (Table I and Fig.1) in order to have a basis with which to compare post-storm observations.  It is important that these samples be collected as soon as possible after the storm, before mixing can take place within the aquifer.\r\n\r\n",
