 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided to hold a MARGINS' Theoretical and Experimental school where \"Rheology and Deformation of the Lithosphere at Continental Margins\" will be the topic of deliberations. Communication between experimentalists and theoreticians is essential to design experiments to address the broader implications raised by macroscopic field observations on the one hand, and small-scale laboratory findings on the other. The workshop will foster cross-disciplinary inquiry into rheology and deformation of the lithosphere. The workshop will consist of a 4-day short course followed by two days of discussions during which a science plan will be fleshed out for this discipline. The funds will pay for full or partial travel of 50 participants to the workshop, but the total number of attendees are expected to be as much as 95 scientists from various subfields of geology and geophysics.\r\n\r\n",
