 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are expanding the accessibility of active learning opportunities in the sciences by providing all Sonoma State University (SSU) biology students with experiences in scientific investigations early in their biology program.  To accomplish this, we are adapting activities developed in three successful undergraduate programs:  \"Evaluating the divergence with gene flow model in natural populations:  morphological and molecular analyses of African ecotone and rainforest birds\" (T. Smith, PI-NSF); \"Molecular genetic analysis applied to evolution, ecology, and systematic biology\" (F. Bayliss, PI-NSF); and \"Genetic diversity in natural populations\" (T. Smith, PI--NIH).  A common theme in these programs is the use of molecular genetic data to understand patterns and processes in evolution, ecology, and conservation biology.  We have adapted these activities to provide a series of introductory level \"research experiences\" that emphasize hypothesis testing, the use of modern equipment and investigative methods, and the development of critical thinking skills.     Educators and policy makers have recognized the need to stimulate student interest in the sciences.  However, most undergraduate biology curricula do not adequately prepare students for careers in science.  In the Department of Biology at SSU, we have begun the process of reshaping and updating our curriculum.  The goals of the proposed curricula are:  1) to create an environment of active learning that inspires students' interest in biology (and other sciences) by directly involving them in the scientific process from the beginning: 2) to provide students with an introduction to scientific approaches and critical thinking skills that will be applicable throughout their lives; 3) to create a learning community where lower-division students, upper-division students, and faculty work together, and 4) to provide qualified advanced students with opportunities to gain teaching experience and high-level training in modern investigative and laboratory techniques.",
