 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three-year collaboration between the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO), Office of Marine Programs (OMP), and fourteen marine and environmental academic departments. This wide-ranging effort prepares twelve Graduate Teaching Fellows per year to engage K-12 teachers and students in inquiry and educational technology activities, field exercises, and URI's NSF-funded Living on the Edge exhibit. Paired with Faculty Mentors, Fellows are working with Project Staff to directly reach 272 teacher participants and more than 13,300 students and their parents, many underrepresented, through a suite of formal and informal education.\r\nTwo activity themes provide the foundation for project activities. Under the learning processes theme, content knowledge related to marine and environmental topics is being used to enhance student and teacher learning. Methods apply cognitive principles and innovative pedagogy.  Incorporated in the technology theme, teachers are receiving instruction in the use of the Internet (including OMP's interactive site, Discovering Coastal Environments (http://omp.gso.uri.edu/doce.htm) to access educational resources and evaluate them for use in the classroom. Fellows are also introducing teachers and students to other technologies such as GIS, remote sensing, and the instrumentation they utilize in their thesis research.",
