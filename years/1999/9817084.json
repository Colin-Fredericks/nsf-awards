 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development, cells acquire a wide variety of shapes that are\r\n>tailored to their differentiated functions.  The shape of a plant cell is\r\n>dictated by the wall that surrounds it, a complex and highly structured\r\n>matrix of carbohydrates, proteins, phenolic compounds, and lipids.  The\r\n>pattern in which a wall expands as that cell enlarges depends upon its\r\n>composition and structure, which in turn is controlled by the cell within.\r\n>The work described in this proposal is aimed at furthering our\r\n>understanding of mechanisms governing plant cell morphogenesis.\r\n>\tMutations in three maize genes required for leaf epidermal cell\r\n>morphogenesis have been isolated.  In all of these \"brick\" mutants,\r\n>epidermal cells expand to achieve a normal size and overall rectangular\r\n>shape, but are completely lacking the marginal lobes characteristic of leaf\r\n>blade epidermal cells.  Preliminary studies of brk mutant phenotypes have\r\n>led to two alternative hypotheses for Brk gene function.  The first is that\r\n>Brk genes promote intracellular asymmetries, which direct non-uniform\r\n>patterns of deposition/secretion of wall components, producing specialized\r\n>epidermal cell shapes.  The second is that Brk genes are required for the\r\n>synthesis of particular wall components needed to achieve non-uniform\r\n>patterns of cell expansion.  In the experiments proposed under Specific Aim\r\n>1, these hypotheses are explored through further characterization of\r\n>intracellular and extracellular events associated with the formation of\r\n>epidermal cell lobes, and how these events are altered in each of the 3 brk\r\n>mutants.  Specific Aim 2 is to use genetic mosaic analysis to determine\r\n>whether each gene functions cell autonomously or non-autonomously to\r\n>control cell shape.  To pursue an understanding of Brk gene function in\r\n>molecular terms, Specific Aim 3 is to clone one of the Brk genes using\r\n>transposon tagging.  Subsequent to cloning one of the Brk genes, the amino\r\n>acid sequence of its predicted protein product will be determined and\r\n>analyzed for homology to other proteins or protein motifs, and the\r\n>expression of this gene will be examined to determine how it relates to\r\n>epidermal cell morphogenesis.",
