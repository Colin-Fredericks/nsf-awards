 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to use a proprietary nano-crystalline metal oxide as a unique sensing material.  A step function improvement in stability and capability for rapid measurements of CO and formaldehyde with ultra-sensitivity should be achieved resulting in an increase in the number of active sites inherent in the nano-structure materials.  The Phase I effort will use a unique completely integrated effort to make the material and to apply it to the sensor. The fabrication focus will be for devices demonstrating a high degree of sensitivity and low unit cost.  The proposer will establish tile criteria for the electronic integration of the sensor as an array into Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning manufactured systems.  Phase II will focus on developing and demonstrating a high degree of selectivity for sensing multiple VOC's and the electronic interface needed for commercialization. Public concern about environmental quality encompasses the area where people work and live-the indoor air environment.  Carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde often accumulate in this environment.  An unmet need exists for improved methods for cost-effective in-situ onsite measurement and monitoring of these constituents.\r\n        The systematic investigation of the relationship between the microstructure and property will lead to the development of novel metal oxides with exotic characteristics.  Applications involving environmental monitoring, oil refining, chemical manufacturing, automotive control, and industrial process control are among the potential uses.",
