 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875754\r\nCarraway\r\nThis is an award to support research on the thermal and photochemical induced reactions of iron in several oxidation states and chemical forms.  The photochemical processes of dissolved iron subject to being complexed by natural ligands will be studied with respect to reactivity and reaction products.  Thermal and photochemical reactions of iron in colloidal form and in nanoclusters will be investigated for its potential role in enhancement of reactivity attributable to the relatively large  surface area of iron in those forms.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program that emphasizes combining discovery of new knowledge with inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning.  The research component is expected to lead to more efficient and versatile treatment processes as well as better understanding than now exists of the dynamic behavior of microbial nutrients.  The educational component of this project will relate the underlying science associated with corrosion of iron to experiences students have had personally and indirectly as exemplified by observations of  transformations of the iron hull of the Titanic during its 80 years of exposure to sea water.\r\n\r\n",
