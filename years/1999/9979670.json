 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GK-12 program, in partnership with seven local school districts, is developing a sustainable program for the integration of SMET research and education. The program is strengthening the already successful, and on-going, partnerships between the school districts and the UA's current outreach programs by incorporating strong partnerships between University of Arizona fellows and K-12 educators for bi-directional knowledge transfer. Fellows and their faculty mentors are gaining experience with inquiry-based teaching and diverse learners while sharing their research expertise with K-12 educators. K-12 educators are gaining experience in scientific inquiry, and are sharing their knowledge of teaching and learning with the fellows and faculty mentors. The long-term impact will result in more effective teaching within the college professorate and K-12 educators.\r\nThe unique feature of this program is that districts are able to identify a particular outreach need, and work in collaboration with CATTS to create customized programs to address the need. The program has four components: (1) an organizational and governing structure that includes input from K-12 educators, faculty mentors, and outreach directors; (2) a preparation stage in which fellows, faculty mentors and K-12 educators are laying the groundwork for the partnerships and preparing the fellows for the K-12 learning environment; (3) an implementation stage in which the partners are working together in the local schools; and (4) an assessment program that measures the programs success in integrating science, mathematics, and engineering research with education at all levels. Recruitment and selection processes are ensuring the participation of diverse groups, especially Hispanic minorities, which comprise about half the student population in Tucson. The program is receiving strong support from teachers, school districts, and The University of Arizona, including matching financial support for graduate fellows and a University of Arizona pledge to maintain the program at least 3 years beyond NSF funding.",
