 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tSeasonal birth patterns have been observed in virtually all human\r\npopulations.  While such patterns are known and well understood in many\r\nanimal species, they are difficult to analyze in humans, since biological\r\nfactors contributing to birth rates are confounded with cultural factors.\r\nTaken as a whole, the conclusion of the many studies on birth seasonality\r\nin humans is that while such seasonal variation is universal, the causes of\r\nvariation are not universal.  Most of the research that has attempted to\r\nexplain observed seasonal patterns in specific populations has focused on\r\nonly a few possible causal factors.  In many cases factors such as diet,\r\nworkload, and climate are shown to be correlated with fertility, but the\r\nmechanisms linking them with fertility remain unexplained.  \r\n\tThe proposed study will analyze seasonal birth patterns in an indigenous\r\nAmerican population (the Anu of northwestern Venezuela).  It will describe\r\nseasonal variation in  proximate determinants of fertility, including\r\ncharacteristics of ovarian cycles and fetal loss.  These data will be used\r\nin models of fecundability and fetal loss that together describe\r\nseasonality of fertility.  The study includes analysis of 1346 urine\r\nsamples that were collected twice weekly during the seasons of most and\r\nfewest conceptions. The samples will be assayed to determine levels of\r\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin (the hormone that indicates pregnancy) and of\r\nurinary metabolites of the hormones estradiol and progesterone; the assay\r\ndata then will be used with interview data to determine proportion of\r\ncycles ovulatory, length of cycles, rates of conception, rates of fetal\r\nloss, and levels of progesterone, as an indicator of luteal sufficiency. \r\n\tPrevious investigations of seasonality of fertility have been based\r\nlargely on factors specific to the population being studied.  The proposed\r\nstudy uses a model of seasonality of fertility that can be applied to any\r\npopulation.  By combining existing models of fecundability and fetal loss,\r\nthe impact of individual proximate determinants of fertility on seasonal\r\nfertility patterns can be more thoroughly analyzed than in previous\r\nstudies.  Seasonal data on more distal determinants, such as diet,\r\nworkload, spouse absence, and nutritional status, can then be evaluated in\r\nterms of the information on the proximate determinants, shedding light on\r\npossible linking mechanisms and opening avenues for further research.\r\n",
