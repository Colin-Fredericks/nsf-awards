 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kentucky EPSCoR will enhance the academic science and technology (S&T) infrastructure in:  engineering, molecular biology, and information networking.  The project will:  create research positions at the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville and provide the equipment and a state-of-the-art environment for conducting networking research in the new multi-sector Center for Advanced Networking at the University of Kentucky.  In the area of nanoscale technology EPSCoR will provide a state-of-the-art Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) facility at the University of Kentucky for characterizing the properties of materials and devices.  This facility will be part of the materials characterization facility in the Advanced Science and Technology Commercialization Center (ASTeCC).  At the University of Louisville EPSCoR will also create a new research position in electronics and will complete a previously initiated plan to establish a nationally competitive center for molecular neurobiology.  The overall emphasis of the Kentucky EPSCoR project will be on establishing infrastructure that is sustainable, such as new research positions and facilities, which are a permanent part of each university's long-term plans.  In addition, EPSCoR will augment the human resources programs of the state through a multi-aspect program for introducing undergraduates to research and retaining them in a scientific career including a state-wide fellowship program for minorities and students from underrepresented groups and an Infrastructure Enhancement Program to improve the quality of science and engineering education in the states predominantly undergraduate institutions. The Kentucky EPSCoR will be coordinated with the state Science & Technology plan through the Kentucky Science and Technology Council, Inc. (KSTC).\r\n\r\n",
