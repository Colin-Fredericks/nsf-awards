 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for an investigation of logistics efficiency improvements through coordinating transportation, inventory, and value-added operations scheduling decisions at a third party warehouse. For the purpose of third party logistics planning, inventory requirements and shipment release schedules are interrelated, value-added operations scheduling problems have unique characteristics, and analysis of time-window constraints is of practical importance. Thus, the research concentrates on developing analytical models and numerical tools for:  (1) Third Party Warehousing and Transportation for Distribution to Multiple Market Areas; (2) Scheduling Value-added Operations;  and, (3) Integrating Transportation, Inventory, and Value Added Scheduling Decisions under Demand Time-Windows.\r\n     The objectives include introducing new avenues of theoretical research with practical implications, contributing to the theory of logistics coordination through analytical modeling and methodological development, and gaining insight for solving complex real-life problems.  The results will broaden the theory of logistics and provide a better understanding of the structure of  practical supply chain management problems. This research addresses a strong need for analytical and numerical decision making tools for effective supply-chain management practices, and thus plays an important role in bridging the gap between academia and industry.  If successful, the results will have a significant impact on the role of third party services for effective logistics management.\r\n",
