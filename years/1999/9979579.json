 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manipulatives, motivation, mentoring (M3) - these are the three themes this GK-12 project is using to create a technologically innovative highway that is empowering K-12 students with science, math, engineering, and technology (SMET) skills and thus broadening their career opportunities. The project uses Hybrid and electric vehicles as the platform for investigation and discovery in new, emerging, and environmentally responsible fields that affect not only individuals in our society, but also society in America as a whole. Manipulatives such as addition and subtraction conceptualization in the early years, alternative fuel engine simulation in junior high, design and analysis of semi-conductor solar panels in high school, and graphical computer-based education tools throughout these years, are providing visualization of real-world systems. Through exposure to the frontiers of discovery in electronics, power systems, computer-based control, system dynamics, safety, etc., this project is developing a vision that motivates students to master SMET fundamentals. Mentoring relationships are bringing the skills, vision, and enthusiasm of successful engineering graduate and undergraduate students into the lives of grades K- 12 children. M3 education is being constructed via a partnership between three participating Pennsylvania school districts, the Women in Science and Engineering Program with General Motors support, and Penn State University's Colleges of Engineering, Science, Earth and Mineral Sciences, and Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
