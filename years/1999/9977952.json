 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project proposes to study the use of groupware calendar systems within a number of organizations that have widely adopted them. Because local calendaring practices vary from site to site, the result is a variety of calendar cultures that afford different coordination behaviors within these organizations. In addition, the imminent availability of open standards created by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in support of calendar application interoperability means that calendars can more easily be shared across organizational boundaries (i.e., between businesses, public institutions and homes.) Thus, there are new opportunities for the use of shared groupware calendars across organizations (i.e., \"global calendaring\" practices). The PI will examine the IETF-Calsh standards design and their potential impacts on calendaring use and technology adoption across businesses as well as in home environments, with special attention to the practices and impacts of merging professional and personal calendars. This research will advance our understanding of collective time management practices within and across organizations, as well as between home and work.\r\n\r\n",
