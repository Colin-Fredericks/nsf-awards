 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Dr. Hicham Fenniri of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University.   The research aims to: 1) synthesize large supramolecular assemblies with predefined architecture, using molecules held in hexameric rosettes by multiple hydrogen bonds between neighboring complementary units, 2) investigate the factors which lead to assembly formation and stability, and 3) develop artificial sensors using a combination of combinatorial chemistry and self-assembly.   The molecules synthesized in this project might find uses in drugs, biosensors, and separations.\r\nThe educational part of this proposal includes developing a new advanced course on combinatorial chemistry, and improving current laboratory courses for first and second year undergraduate students in a variety of ways, including: 1) improved laboratory hand-outs, 2) a new template to report experimental results, 3) better training of teaching assistants, and 4) on-line chemical searching in the laboratory.   Students doing research with the PI will learn valuable skills in the areas of organic synthesis of supramolecular materials and combinatorial chemistry.",
