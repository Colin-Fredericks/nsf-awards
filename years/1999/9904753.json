How do the properties of lipid bilayers modulate the functioning of integral membrane proteins in respiratory and photosynthetic energy transduction and in signal transduction, as a consequence of membrane-mediated interactions between components which actively influence their properties?  Experiments addressing this question will utilize reconstituted proteolipid membranes in which the lipid and protein compositions can be readily varied.  The goal is to investigate the significance and role of the following factors in controlling the anisotropic structure of a membrane and its functionality: (i) the incorporation of nonbilayer-forming lipids, (ii) hydrophobic matching between lipids and proteins, (iii) phospholipid polyunsaturation. The protein systems to be studied include the integral membrane proteins cytochrome b6f, and its physiological peripheral electron transfer partner, plastocyanin, and members of the superfamily of seven transmembrane helical G-protein linked receptors such as rhodopsin.  CPWR spectroscopy will be used to elucidate changes in the structural features of the proteolipid systems (film thickness; molecular orientation; mass and optical absorption anisotropies) during their functioning, and the thermodynamics of protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that these experiments will provide new insights into the participation of lipids in interprotein electron transport in biomembrane-based energy conversion, and in the transfer of information across biological membranes from the external environment into the interior of cells and organelles.  This should have broad implications for all membrane-based biological processes, as well as for the development of future proteolipid-based technologies, such as molecular electronics, protein-based biosensors, and biomimetic energy conversion systems.\r\n",
