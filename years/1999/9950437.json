 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a networked computer facility for instruction, student research, and technology training.  It is leading to improved psychology courses and laboratories in cognition, sensation and perception, test and measurement, and physiological psychology. This facility has been designed to provide opportunities for enhanced student understanding of concepts and research methodology through direct experience, expanded student and faculty research possibilities, and training in technology as an information source, a research tool, and a communication tool. \r\n\r\nThe instructional facility is being equipped with 17 Apple Power Mac G3 computers with Pentium processors.  This choice of equipment will allow the operation of both Macintosh and MS-DOS/ Windows based software. This facility is being equipped with a variety of educational psychology software.  In particular, we are implementing a package of 15 experiments that have been developed for undergraduate use in Cognition and Perception, running on an MS-DOS platform, and a package of landmark experiments in Memory and Cognition running on the Macintosh Operating System platform.  \r\n\r\nThis enhancement of our facilities and the implementation of technology into our curriculum is leading to significant improvements in the quality of our undergraduate instruction, the quality of student-faculty research in the department, and our reputation as a prominent educational leader. \r\n",
