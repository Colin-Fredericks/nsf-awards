 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971794\r\n     The goal of the research funded by this Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to examine multi-criteria decision making in the broadest context of engineering design, including both product/process/service and organization design for their realization.  This research builds upon Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, which essentially states that all multi-criteria decision making approaches are flawed.  The first objective will be to explore and, if possible, develop a theory of decision making that will minimize flaws causing worrisome decisions.  The second objective will be to view organizational design also as a decision-making process and to apply the multi-criteria decision-making principles to this as well.\r\n     If successful, this research will provide insights into the flaws present in most extant approaches to engineering design decision making, and it will lead to methods for the minimization of the impacts of such flaws.  These decisions affect nearly a trillion dollars worth of American enterprise, and even small improvements will have enormous economic benefit.",
