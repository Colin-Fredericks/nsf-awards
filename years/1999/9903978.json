The project will examine how culturally construction visions of the body are exemplified in this Mexican location, what general Mexican cultural values it implies, how these differ from the values in the US, where many of the medical specialists have trained, and how these values in practice are influenced by the existing social and economic inequalities in Mexico (the most striking difference is that in the US transplant organs tend to be derived from brain-dead cadavers, while in Mexico family are seen as the appropriate source).  Using participant observation, interviewing, consensus modeling, statistical analysis of hospital records, and textual analysis of popular media, the student will focus on transplant patients, family, hospital staff in three different hospitals, one focusing on poor, middle class, and more wealthy patients.  This research will advance our understanding of how different cultures construct images of the body, and how these images are shaped by biomedical theory, and how these issues contribute to our understanding of modernity as a concept and its expression in different cultural settings. In addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important area of the world. \r\n\r\n",
