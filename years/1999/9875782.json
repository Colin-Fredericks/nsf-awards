 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project has two broad objectives. First, a laboratory research program that supports education and training of graduate students and provides significant \"hands-on\" training in research for undergraduate students will be developed and implemented. Second, new strategies for teaching biology at the molecular level at both the graduate and undergraduate level in classroom and laboratory settings will be developed and implemented.\r\n\r\nThese research efforts will advance our understanding of a critical process for eukaryotic cell function, the movement of macromolecules between membrane-bound compartments (organelles). The regulation of this process, particularly how organelles maintain their unique assortment of protein and lipid components is currently not well understood. This research will address the question by examining the function of a protein hypothesized to regulate this process, the Arl 1 protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that binds alternately GDP and GTP. The hypothesis upon which the research portion of the proposal is based is the following: the Arl 1 protein, like its close relatives the Arf proteins, is a modulator of membrane traffic in a nucleotide-dependent manner and as a result is a member of a novel signaling pathway. This portion of the project has three goals, (1) examination of the interactions between Arl 1 proteins and guanine nucleotides, (2) determination of the role of Arl l protein in regulation of membrane traffic, and (3) isolation and characterization of proteins that interact with Arl 1 protein. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be significantly involved in achieving these goals.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the second objective, the undergraduate core curriculum for Biology will be revised to integrate several courses, Introduction to Biology, Biochemistry, and Genetics. This integrated curriculum will in turn form the basis for a newly approved Concentration in Molecular and Cellular Biology that will include many different course offerings, including Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, Population Genetics, and advanced seminars in current topics like signal transduction. In Biochemistry, the emphasis will shift from memorization of details to gaining an understanding of the underlying conceptual framework for this discipline. Necessary skills for rational scientific discourse, such as analytical thinking, writing, and oral skills, will be emphasized. Collaborative learning exercises will be implemented to augment the current lecture-based format. Use of existing computer technologies, as well as development of new computer-based tools, will further strengthen course work.  Additional programs will be undertaken to enhance mentoring and community outreach.\r\n\r\n",
