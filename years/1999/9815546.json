 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\tThis project will study dental variation in four groups of living hominoids: gorillas, chimpanzees, orang-utans, and gibbons. Novel image-analysis techniques will be used to accurately measure morphological features on the dental surface of these apes. A large number of specimens from various museums will be studied, so as to sample all geographical populations.\r\n\tThis study is important for several reasons:  (1) It will have implications for fossil species discrimination. Dental characters are consistently used to differentiate fossil species, but because of limited sample sizes, the nature and patterns of variation in species differentiating characters cannot be studied. The present study will provide an exhaustive comparative database of patterns of variation in living hominoids against which variation in similar characters in fossil hominoid species can be compared.  (2) It will help in understanding the place of humans in nature. A study of the degree and pattern of dental variation will help in understanding the within- and between-grouprelationships of the hominoids. This being the group of primates most closely related to humans, it will help in understanding of the systematic and evolutionary relationships of humans.  (3) It will help in understanding the conservation status of the hominoids. Several species and subspecies of hominoids are threatened with extinction in their natural habitat, and much international effort is expended in trying to save them. The study of dental variation as proposed here will help in understanding the taxonomy and interrelationships of the various populations, subspecies and species of hominoids. This is critical for forming informed opinions on the need for conservation in the hominoids. \r\n\r\n",
