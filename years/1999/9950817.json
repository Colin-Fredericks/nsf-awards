 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the introduction of computers into the undergraduate chemistry laboratory for the purpose of enhancing the chemical education of students pursuing degrees in biological and biochemical fields of study. The introduction of computers to the labs is accomplished through the adaptation and implementation of the LabWorks II SCI interface system for chemistry (NSF-DUE 9156101). The SCI interface is well described as a successful tool in undergraduate chemistry laboratories. Additionally, some of the results from LabVIEW Software (NSF-DUE 9251226) are adapted. Several of current experiments in our chemistry courses as well as some in bioorganic, biochemistry, and biology have been revised for the inclusion of this instrumentation. The computers in the labs are also used in tutorial sessions to help students visualize some of the more complex structures and mechanisms.  This is accomplished through the adaptation C-MoR, a software developed at University of Richmond  (Myers, H., Southeast Regional Meeting, American Chemical Society, Research Triangle Park, NC, Nov. 4-7, 1998, Abstract 183). The anticipated outcome of this project is that the implementation of computer aided chemistry improves the students' performance and ignites more interest in science.",
