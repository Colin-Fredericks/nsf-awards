 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Antonia Foias will conduct two seasons of archaeological fieldwork at the site of Motul de San Jose, located in Guatemala's Central Peten. This secondary center was occupied during the Late Classic period and thus dates from the height of Mayan civilization.  Preliminary work by Dr. Foias and her colleagues indicates that the site was a center for the production of polychrome vessels with elaborately painted texts and that these were widely distributed. The goal of this work is to address the question of Mayan social organization and to determine the social, political and economic strategies which Mayan elites used to bind large numbers of individuals together in effectively functioning social units. Although many sites have been excavated, archaeologists still do not know the extent to which power was centralized or segmented among multiple factions. \r\n\r\nThe research will include a detailed settlement survey and extensive subsurface testing in the monumental site core and periphery. During the 1999 and 2000 field seasons the primary goal will be to examine large-scale distribution of economic activities across the site core and periphery to understand the degree of elite control over economic production and exchange. An intensive survey of a 2 square km. area around the site core and of two 250 m wide and 4 km long transects oriented North and South of the site core will be complemented by test pitting of all  plaza groups and by intensive shovel testing of refuse deposits surrounding structures. The extensive artifact collections provided by the test pitting and shovel testing programs will be used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of production activities as identified by manufacturing debris, production tools or high densities of specific artifact classes. The association of these production loci with elite or non-elite households will indicate the degree of political control over this economic subsystem. The scale of inter-regional exchange will be estimated through quantification of non-local items. Neutron activation analysis of ceramics will provide information on the spatial distribution of production.\r\n\r\nMany scholars have considered control over economic institutions the crucial factor in sociopolitical evolution. Debate about Maya political organization pivots on the degree to which the elite controlled critical aspects of the economy. Yet Classic Maya economics remain the least understood aspect of this Mesoamerican civilization. This project promises to provide critical economic data to address this question.\r\n",
