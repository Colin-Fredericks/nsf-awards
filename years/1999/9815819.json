The researchers will be undertaking a study of the effects of environmental agents on reproductive processes.  The researchers plan to analyze the effects of several environmentally relevant toxic compounds on various aspects of reproductive function.  They hope to provide new insights into the mechanisms by which reproductive function is compromised.  The problems to be explored are:  1) the effects of the environmental contaminant, dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), on ovarian function and early pregnancy; and  2) the effects of xenoestrogens [chlordecone (Kepone), and O-P'-DDT], and a natural estrogen, estradiol, on uterine gene expression of immediate early protooncogenes and several relevant uterine growth factors such as heparin binding EGF-like growth factor and lactoferrin.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. researchers' expertise is in the area of molecular methods of signal transduction and the Japanese have expertise in the endocrinological area. Results of this research would provide a significant advancement to the field of endocrine disruptors.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of a younger scientist and graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.\r\n***\r\n",
