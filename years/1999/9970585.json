 "awd_abstract_narration": "The surface chemistry of radical species is the focus of this research project carried out at Northwestern University in the group of Professor Peter Stair.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, this group is examining the interaction of hydrocarbon radicals produced in a clean gas phase source with well characterized metal and metal oxide surfaces.  Spectroscopic, kinetic, and isotope labeling studies are used to probe the mechanism of C-C coupling on these surfaces.  Methyl radical oxidation is also being explored.  Analogies between gas phase radical reactions, for example methyl interacting with hydroxyl radicals, are probed on the surface as well.  \r\n \r\nMany heterogeneous catalytic reactions are likely to proceed via radical reaction intermediates.  Our understanding of these radical surface processes is quite limited however.  In this research project, a number of state of the art spectroscopic and synthetic methods are combined to probe the mechanisms of surface reactions involving radical participants.  The detailed information obtained from these studies is useful in designing catalytic materials and process chemistries for hydrocarbon refining. \r\n \r\n",
