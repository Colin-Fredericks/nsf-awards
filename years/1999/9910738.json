 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this exploratory research is to show that high quality American Sign Language (ASL) can be generated on a notebook or hand-held computer to support interaction between a deaf person and a speech-driven computer interface.   The ASL Synthesizer the PI would like to create would accept text that is spoken or typed by a person, or text that is produced by a computer, and generate graphical representations in the ASL alphabet.   It would also be able to display, upon user request via shorthand input, certain predefined ASL messages.   In preparation for this project, the PI's team has worked with several deaf colleagues and ASL interpreters during the past year to evaluate current research on machine-generated ASL.  They have considered the problems of converting ASL to printed or spoken language, and believe they have developed an approach based on extensions to the Dance Event Language developed by John Simmons at George Mason University which will provide a basis for eventually developing real-time two-way communication between deaf and hearing individuals.   Recognizing that their goal of providing on-the-fly translations to and from ASL is an ambitious one, the PI's team believes that at least three phases of research are necessary:   (1) Develop a practical method for generating lifelike graphical representations of the ASL alphabet and predefined ASL messages;   (2) Work with others in the field to develop a practical method for translating between English text and ASL;   (3) Develop a practical method for reading ASL into a computer.  The focus of the current project is limited to Phase 1 only.   If successful, this work will form the basis for future proposals to NSF to research machine translation and machine recognition of ASL along the lines suggested above for  Phases 2 and 3.   Under this award, the PI will be assisted by Neil Scott, chief engineer for the Archimedes Project, who will be responsible for overall technical design and implementation.  The research team will also include one or more members who are deaf.",
