In particular, this proposal focuses on the development of smart pixel based systems suitable for interfacing large capacity page-oriented optical storage devices with conventional electronic computers. The single chip smart pixel arrays proposed here are based on a photonic VLSI technology that is based on conventional CMOS device technologies.\r\n\r\nThe project is divided into four phases. The first phase concentrates on development and testing of the smart pixel circuits required to implement the filter. Phase 2 uses these smart pixel components to implement a 16 x 16-bit database filter that provides input bandwidth comparable to a strictly electronic implementation. Knowledge gained building the 16 x 16-bit system is applied in phase 3 to the implementation of a 128 x 128-bit filter. With more than 16,000 input channels, this system is expected to provide significantly more input bandwidth than electronic components can achieve. Further, this implementation represents a factor of 4 more input data channels than current state-of-the-art photonic VLSI components. To complete the research, both systems will be utilized as application test beds suitable for evaluating the practical and technological barriers that face efforts to incorporate the proposed database filter into the read head of future page-oriented optical storage devices.\r\n***\r\n",
