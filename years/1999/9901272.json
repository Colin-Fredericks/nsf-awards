 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed conference on 'Social Change and Sustainable Transport (SCAST)' brings together European and North American scholars from social science and transportation engineering traditions to share current research and to identify avenues of investigation that will benefit from transatlantic collaboration.  Specifically, the focus will be on differences and similarities in the social structures of both continents and how these might provide a rational foundation for future research on sustainable transport systems.  The effort was spawned from the recognition that future generations will not enjoy current levels of mobility in the absence of some very drastic changes in the manner by which the transport needs of society are met.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of the conference are to exchange cutting-edge research ideas and methods, to stimulate international collaborations and strengthen existing linkages on this theme, and to enhance the level of involvement of junior scholars from diverse academic backgrounds.  The funding request is to defray the expenses of North American participants only-European participation is being funded by the European Science Foundation.",
