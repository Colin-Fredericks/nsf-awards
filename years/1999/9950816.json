 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project adapts and applies exemplary manufacturing engineering educational practices in concurrent engineering and time-compression technologies from across the nation at Southwest Texas State University.  This effort largely borrows on the successes of two nationally reputed schools in manufacturing, Purdue University and Georgia Institute of Technology.   The project supports the teaching of the integrated application of rapid tooling and other time-compression technologies that center around rapid prototyping (RP), such as Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), investment casting and Room Temperature Vulcanizing (RTV) molding in manufacturing education technology courses.  This represents a comprehensive curriculum change because the teaching objectives are infused into a core of building experiences instead of being addressed in a compartmentalized fashion.  Our objective is implemented by designing exercises in three sophomore and senior level courses that permit each student to apply several varying technical approaches in an integrated fashion.  The resulting student experience provides intimate knowledge of a complete product cycle, from design to manufacture, using a \"hands-on\" approach.  The most significant outcome of the project is the graduation of a cadre of engineering technology students, many of whom are minority students, who have had \"hands-on\" laboratory experiences with synthesizing time-compression technologies and understand all of the technical activities that span the product cycle.",
