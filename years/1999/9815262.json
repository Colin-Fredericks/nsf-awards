These fungi have been shown to be necessary for the growth and development of fine roots in many systems. It is in the fine roots, where most plants get many of the nutrients they need and the fungi play a vital role in the development of these roots and may also may have a direct role in the transfer of nutrients.  In spite of their importance, EM fungi are often neglected by plant ecologists or they are treated as a single group (without regard to species). Due to their small size, the difficulty of and time consuming methods of species identification, coupled with their belowground habitat, working with them especially at the species level has difficult in the past. This project will determine the colonization strategy of five species of EM fungi in a temperate forest ecosystem. Specifically, this proposal would study the sizes and spatial patterning for genets of 3 of the 5 species that have very different life strategies.  A molecular technique (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms) will be used as the primary tool for discerning genetic identity. This technique will provide a fast, reliable and abundant source of variable markers, which will all allow the PI to identify the EM fungi to the species level. In addition, using this technique, a better understanding of the spatial patterns of EM fungi will be done. This work will provide tools for future investigators and allow them to explore and understand the population structure of key EM fungi.\r\n\r\n",
