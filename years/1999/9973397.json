 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project is focused on developing a new analytical tool in mathematical geophysics based on using the Riemann-Hilbert approach  to the solution of scattering problems in inhomogeneous geomaterials. Topics of investigation include: (i) A Lax pair formulation of the  vector elastodynamic equation; (ii) The Riemann-Hilbert approach to  diffraction problems in a quarter plane and in a corner; (iii) The Riemann-Hilbert approach to  scattering of  elastic waves at a vertical interface.  The principle objective of the research is to derive  integral representations of the solutions for the indicated problems, which would involve integration along some contours in the complex plane. Special features of the new method, and, most importantly, the fact that this method does not require  separation of variables, allow one to expect the possibility of moving beyond the limitations of the traditional Fourier,  sine,  cosine or Laplace transforms.\r\n\r\nThe theory of elastic waves plays an important role as one of the principal sources of information about the structure of various parts of the Earth. Specifically, the mathematical models considered in the project form the  theoretical basis to study fractured vertical deep fault zones, transition zones between the different blocks as well as in-situ properties of soil and geologic materials.",
