Improvements in lenses, light sources and general microscope design have dramatically enhanced image quality, and have allowed for the visualization of structures that were too small or too faint to be detected using earlier instruments. Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy enables intracellular structures to be observed with unprecedented clarity. Because image contrast is generated by differences in refractive index, living cells can be viewed without staining or other manipulation. Fluorescence microscopy has traditionally been used with fixed cells, and while this method remains extremely valuable, the introduction of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) as a research tool has opened new vistas for performing fluorescence microscopy with living cells. \r\n\tBecause of these advances, a number of research groups in the Cummings Life Science Center at the University of Chicago are finding increasing applications for DIC and fluorescence microscopy. Many of these studies involve routine observations that nevertheless require very good optics. Examples include microscopy-based genetic screens of yeast cells, and the visualization of secretory granule biogenesis in protozoa. This award will fund the purchase of a DIC/fluorescence microscopy system to be housed in the Cummings building. The system will include: (a) a Zeiss Axioplan 2 DIC/fluorescence microscope; (b) a Kodak MDS-120 digital camera; (c) a PowerMac G3 computer; and (d) Improvision's OpenLab image capture software. This system will be suitable for operation on two levels. For routine observations, the microscope will be operated exclusively by manual controls. For photography, the microscope and digital camera will be controlled with a computer. Hence, the new microscopy system will provide sophisticated capability while allowing for great flexibility. \r\n\tThis facility will enable the research programs of the Cummings groups to expand in new directions. Cummings researchers employ model systems to explore fundamental questions in genetics, cell biology and developmental biology. These groups train a large number of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, who will benefit from unrestricted access to a high-quality microscope. For these reasons, the new microscopy facility will help the University of Chicago to maintain its status as a premier research and teaching institution in the biological sciences. \r\n\r\n",
