The region encompasses American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marinas, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Hawaii, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.  The DELTA Cadre consists of 8 entity-local teams.  Teams include the entity's mathematics curriculum specialist, college mathematics and mathematics education faculty members, and a master teacher.  Project activities include a three-week Cadre Training Institute to deepen members' mathematical and pedagogical knowledge in number/algebra, geometry/measurement, and probability/statistics.  An additional five days will be devoted to the review of standards-based curricular materials in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project include:  improving cadre members' mathematical content and pedagogical knowledge; their understanding of the change process related to the implementation of standards-based curriculum; and their ability to develop and implement research-based models of exemplary professional development materials tailored to the needs of teachers in grades 4-8.\r\n",
