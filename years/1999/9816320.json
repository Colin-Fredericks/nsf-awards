The project will consist of two sets of supplementary materials that could be used independently but will link together consecutively.  Each set of materials will consist of a teacher's guide, a children's book (consumable), and a book for parents that could be used independently of the other books.  One set tentatively entitled \"Developing Numerical Patterns and Strategies\" will function at kindergarten and grade 1 (and at grade 2 and later for those children who still need rapid and accurate sums and differences to 18).  This set will develop children's understandings and use of patterns for small numbers under ten, counting on and counting up, the prerequisite skills necessary for the ten-structured strategies used so effectively by East Asian children.  Activities will be set within word problem settings so that language competence is also developed.  These materials should enable all children to add and subtract rapidly and with understanding using all single-digit numbers by the spring of Grade 1.\r\n\r\nThe second set of books is tentatively titled \"Multidigit Thinking, Calculating, and Problem Solving.\"  Current performance data indicate that multidigit addition and subtraction continue to be a concern both with traditional textbooks and with reform approaches (e.g., 2-digit subtraction in spring of Grade 2 is only 38% correct).  The materials will use hundred-boxes, ten-sticks, and dot drawings to help children build place-value meanings as they develop multidigit addition and subtraction strategies.  This second set of materials can begin to be used in late first grade and will be able to be used to introduce or review these areas in grades 2 through 5 (where some children still are making errors). Differentiated directions will be given according to whether the teacher is teaching initially or reviewing the topic in later grades.  The project materials will be published in English and Spanish.  The project materials address the current severe under-representation in mathematics and science occupations of Latinos and other minority groups. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
