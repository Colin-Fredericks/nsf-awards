 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Southern California program Fast Track to the Professoriate (FTP) is designed to produce a paradigm shift in the way minority science and engineering graduate students are recruited, trained and incentivized for careers in the professoriate. The FTP program intends to create a model for minority support that rewards student success while maximally leveraging the investment of Federal, State, University and private funds, Active recruiting partnerships with CAMP, McNair, and California State University are hallmarks of this program. FTP has been designed to identify, recruit, and support a cadre of students who have a demonstrated commitment to academic careers. The program provides amplification mechanisms for training, orientation and support during periods at which graduate students often lose focus. A key component of FTP will be the Competitive Edge program, beginning the summer before incoming students' first fall quarter of enrollment. Competitive Edge emphasizes not only the acquisition of resource information, critical for success in an academic career, but also serves to promote the formation of community and a mutual support cohort in which students can help one another during their graduate careers and beyond. Acquisition pedagogical skills is facilitated early in the students' graduate careers. Pre-professoriate graduate students who successfully complete early academic milestones are rewarded with attractive, flexible funding packages that give them the freedom to enter research and postdoctoral positions of their own choosing. These flexible funding packages contain two key reward mechanisms: (1) the Research Assistantship Fellowship (RAF), which allows a pre-funded student to independently select research projects of interest, and (2) the Portable Pedagogical Post-doc (PPP), which is awarded following the Ph.D. and provides the student a full year of funding at a teaching or research university. These same mechanisms serve a dual role as incentives for researchers and institutions to welcome successful FTP students to their programs. The five-year project will carefully document successes and failures and widely disseminate strategies that can serve as a model for creating similar programs elsewhere.\r\n",
