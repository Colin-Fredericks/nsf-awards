Because most animals evolved under some form of predation, our currently altered environments are missing dominant selective forces and the biological importance of behavior may be under or over emphasized. This project tests predictions of a simple model to enhance knowledge of consequences of a predator-prey disequilibrium.  The responsiveness of an assemblage of prey species will be contrasted in systems where the demographic effects of predation vary.  Study goals include understanding of: 1) prey retention of predator-recognition abilities once predation has been relaxed and restored; and 2) how anti-predatory behavior changes. Cues associated with past, present, and novel carnivores as well as neutral stimuli will be used during experimental field playback trials. \r\n\r\nMost reserves and protected areas in the USA and elsewhere have lost large mammalian predators.  Because public pressure is great to restore wild carnivores, it is prudent to enhance fundamental knowledge about how prey respond to potential changes in their ecological communities.  This study will contribute to present knowledge by testing assumptions about the importance of predation, interactions between species, and prey memory of predators.  This information which is critical for understanding basic processes in animal behavior and for the restoration of natural communities.\r\n",
