 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9901622\r\nFlueck\r\n\r\nThe American Power Conference (APC), sponsored by the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), is an annual national forum for the discussion of the broad technical aspects of generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of power.  APC has significant educational value particularly for undergraduate students who aim to learn more about the industry.  In recognition of this fact, IIT has been conducting a special program for faculty and students in conjunction with APC.  This program is called the Ben Elliott Sponsored Student Faculty (SSF) Program.  The program features special breakfast seminars and other events (e.g., plant tours) expressly for students in addition to the regular APC technical sessions.\r\n\r\nThrough industry sponsorship, the program has been successful in enabling over 120 students and faculty to participate in APC each year, However, many undergraduate and graduate students are currently unable to attend due to lack of industry sponsors.  The emerging competitive electric power industry environment makes it difficult for existing sponsors to maintain their current levels of sponsorship.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, we request travel funds, for 35 students to attend APC and participate in the Ben Elliott SSF Program for the 1999 APC.  The amount will be cost-shared with funds from utilities and from universities of the students.  The students will be selected from among those enrolled in U.S. universities per the following criteria:\r\n\r\nUndergraduate students, in particular, sophomores and juniors will be given priority.\r\n\r\nWomen, under-represented minorities, and disabled students will be given first preference.\r\n\r\nU.S. citizens and permanent residents will receive greater consideration than non-citizens.\r\n\r\nStudents who have demonstrated prior interest in the power industry either through power engineering courses or through internships will receive additional consideration.\r\n\r\nGraduate students who will present papers at APC will be given preference over other graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis grant will significantly aid the Ben Elliott SSF Program in its mission of encouraging more students (especially undergraduates) to pursue careers in power engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
