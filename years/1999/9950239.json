 "awd_abstract_narration": "This full EMD project is enhancing ANT, a virtual machine framework.    Previously used to teach CS students introductory concepts about machine architecture, assembly language programming and data representation, ANT is being expanded to be applicable and useful across the CS core curriculum, such as in architecture and logic courses, VLSI design courses, compiler courses, and operating systems courses.   ANT is designed to provide students with the background, tools, techniques and intuitions that can be applied to solving real problems. The ANT framework provides continuity between courses, demonstrates real-world examples of code reuse, and gives students a thorough understanding of a computational framework that cuts through many layers of abstraction.  \r\n\r\nThe ANT implementation is being revised to make it suitable for diverse populations, including other universities, community colleges, adult education programs, and high school computing courses.   This is being accomplished by developing multi-platform support and a robust graphical user interface.  A formative evaluation is being conducted at several different computer science education settings.  An evaluation protocol has been developed to be distributed to all test sites. Both pre and post treatment data is being collected to provide a comparison of results using ANT.  In addition a methodology for studying student work habits is being implemented to allow analysis of usefulness of ANT in the context of specific courses.  \r\n\r\nDissemination is being accomplished using an ANT web site containing documentation, tutorials, the evaluation results and the actual ANT platform.  This is being established and maintained on the Harvard University server with the commitment to sustain the site as long as ANT is considered to be useful to teach computer science.   Negotiations are taking place with a publisher of computer science texts books to publish the complete ANT documentation along with a CD-ROM containing the product and sample problems.",
