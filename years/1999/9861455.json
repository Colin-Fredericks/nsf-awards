 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861455\r\n       This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a scanning probe microwave microscope with sub-n-ficrometer spatial resolution for semiconductor characterization in the frequency range of 100 MHz to 50 GHz. The proposed instrument is based on an existing low-resolution scanning microwave microscope (SMM) with a demonstrated capability of providing quantitative data. The primary focus of the proposed approach is to preserve this quantitative aspect of the instrument while improving spatial resolution. It thus presents an alternative to techniques based on scanning tunneling or scanning force microscopes.  The microscope consists of a resonant coaxial cable coupled to a microwave generator on one end and to the sample through an open-ended coaxial probe on the other end. The sample's pen-nittivity and conductivity result in a measurable shift of the coaxial cable's resonant frequency and Q-factor.  Sub-micron spatial resolution in a non-contact mode will be achieved by controlling the probe-to-sample separation using a piezo-driver, imaging in a constant frequency shift or constant Q-factor mode, and using an STM tip as the center conductor of the coaxial probe.  \r\n     The long-term goal of this research is to provide a prototype scanning microwave microscope with improved spatial resolution and proven performance in quantitative semiconductor characterization at microwave frequencies. The multitude of potential applications of such an instrument make it an excellent candidate for commercialization.\r\n",
