 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal is centered around approximation issues in\r\nstochastic programming, in particular as they arise in two quite\r\nchallenging problems: groundwater remediation and equilibria problems in\r\nan uncertain environment.  The first of these requires dealing with\r\nstochastic programs where the `recourse' is determined by a system of\r\npartial differential equations. The `stochastic' equilibrium problem\r\nadds a new level of difficulty, rather than just optimizing one must\r\nfind a mechanism to determine a price system under which the optimization\r\ntakes place. Such equilibria have been derived by relying on fixed point\r\ntheorems.  Finally, because it's only possible to solve discretized\r\nversions of stochastic optimization problems, it's of paramount\r\nimportance to investigate thoroughly approximation issues. Not only the\r\nquestion of approximating the stochastic process that describes the\r\nuncertainty but also how to improve the construction of this process\r\nfrom the available data and to analyze the effect this will have on \r\nthe solution of the stochastic program.\r\n\r\nThe field of stochastic programming provides mathematical tools for\r\nsolving and analyzing models for decision making under uncertainty.\r\nThis project will be concerned with two significant and difficult\r\napplications and with approximation issues:\r\n -- A problem in groundwater remediation which was selected because\r\nit requires both theoretical and computational developments. It's a\r\nstochastic optimization problem where the state of the system is\r\nobtained by solving a partial differential equation whose coefficients\r\nare rapidly oscillating (heterogeneous media) and stochastic (uncertainty\r\nabout the media composition). The possibility of deriving an\r\nhomogenized version of this problem will also be investigated.\r\n -- Walras equilibrium problem in an uncertain environment. This\r\nproblem is selected because it adds a dimension to stochastic\r\noptimization in that one must also find price systems (setting up an\r\n`equilibrium') under which this stochastic optimization must take place. \r\n --  Approximation issues in stochastic programming. The question of\r\nhaving a reliable estimate for the parameters of a dynamic stochastic\r\nprogramming problem is raised. It is expected that a more comprehensive,\r\napproach which makes use of all the information available, rather than\r\njust the collected data will result in more reliable solutions for\r\nstochastic programming problems.\r\n",
