The project will examine the influence of mineral composition on microbial growth, and the resultant influence of microbial colonization on mineral weathering rate and nutrient release, using both laboratory and field methods.  Specific research objectives for the proposed project are to 1) examine the in situ colonization behavior of native organisms on silicates, surface-altered silicates, and basalts as a function of mineral surface characteristics and nutrient content; 2) characterize the influence of feldspar and glass-bound P, N, and Fe on microbial growth and the rate of substrate utilization, 3)(characterize the rate of mineral dissolution and nutrient release as a function of microbial population (type and density) and nutrient limitation and 4) compare the bioavailability of P present as apatite and apatite inclusions to P present in a glass matrix.  The field sites are a nutrient-limited petroleum contaminated aquifer, a methanogenic wetland, and a lignitic sandstone aquifer.  Laboratory microcosms will use aquifer sediments amended with glass or mineral phases as the sole source of inorganic nutrients, and changes in community structure, rate of substrate removal, biomass production, and mineral weathering characterized.  The results of this project will provide insight on the influence of mineral composition on microbial colonization, community structure, and survival in the subsurface, and the role of microorganisms in the early and rapid weathering of specific minerals of biologic value.\r\n",
