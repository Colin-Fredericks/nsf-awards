The Principal Investigators will study two potential sources of contaminants that are arctic freshwater environments - atmospheric deposition and biological vectors, specifically, anadromous fish that carry contaminants from marine to freshwater environments.  They will investigate the relative importance of these two routes of contaminant delivery for freshwater systems of western Alaska using landlocked lakes and lakes with a fluvial connection to the sea.\r\n\r\nBoth the anadromous least cisco (Coregonus sardinella) and the freshwater Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) are important subsistence species in the western Arctic.  In sub-arctic regions, graylings have been found to have higher contaminant concentrations and a different fingerprint of organochlorines (OCs) contaminants in lakes where they co-exist with sockeye salmon (Onchorhynchus nerka).  The Principal Investigators will attempt to determine whether the same situation pertains in the Arctic where OCs are believed to be derived primarily from atmospheric sources.\r\n\r\nStudy locations will be chosen in partnership with the North Slope Borough Wildlife Department and local communities.  Several small interview sessions will be arranged to enable the Principal Investigators and the Traditional Ecological Knowledge (local residents) opportunities to share information and communicative results.\r\n",
