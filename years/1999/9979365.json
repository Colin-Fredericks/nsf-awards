 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves a novel adaptive and scalable wireless network architecture utilizing a mixture of cellular and packet radio network topologies for broadband multimedia communications. The architecture enables rapid adaptability to traffic, channel and interference conditions and will result in significant reductions in transmit power and potential throughput improvements. We investigate techniques that, by coordination among physical, data link, and network layers enable significant improvements in capacity and quality of service relative to the current state-of-the-art. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe main thrust of our research consists of selective use of multiuser detection; self-organization; and adaptive routing. We consider multiuser detection techniques that exploit information available at the data link layer. Specifically, we are investigating the benefits of error detection side information in aiding interference cancellation and suppression. Research in self-organizing involves network connectivity optimization and allocation of resources. This optimization adapts network to topological changes on a relatively longer time scale. Network adaptation to physical and application layer attributes is primarily accomplished via adaptive routing. The investigators are evaluating the suitability of centralized and distributed, or perhaps hybrid, routing approaches. It is desired to provide rapid adaptation to changes in traffic and channel conditions, including interference, as well as changes in quality of service requirements.",
