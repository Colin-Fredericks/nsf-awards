 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tParliamentary government is all about building and maintaining cohesive voting blocs in the legislature.  The development over time of political parties largely has done away with the problem of bloc formation (MPs arrive at parliament already sorted into partisan camps).  Bloc maintenance remains problematic, however -- witness the disintegration of the British Conservative Party over the issue of European Union.  The principal objective of the dissertation is to determine whether political institutions influence the ability of a party  to act cohesively.  In particular, the dissertation examines the effect of electoral, parliamentary, and party rules on party unity.\r\n\tParty unity does not depend entirely on institutions; contentious political issues and ideological disagreements between party members can undermine unity just as norms of solidarity can foster it.  Thus, the research design of this project must meet two challenges:  it must (1) maximize variation in instituional structures so that the effects of institutions on party unity (if they exist) are visible, and (2) provide enough statistical control to separate the impact of institutions from the impact of issues, ideological conflict, and norms.\r\n\tThe single-country research design that is common in the existing literature is ill-equipped to meet these two challenges.  Accordingly, the dissertation adopts a more effective and ambitious research design that has been employed previously.  The design is comparative and multi-leveled, examining party cohesion in Australia, Canada, Great Britain and New Zealand from 1945 to 1997 from the perspective of MPs, political parties, and parliaments.  Comparing across space and time increases variation in institutional variables, adds degrees of freedom, strengthens statistical control, and improves external validity.  Studying cohesion at three levels of analysis allows one to generate more observable implications of hypotheses, assess the reliability of results, and uncover connections between individual behavior and party and parliamentary rules.  \r\n",
