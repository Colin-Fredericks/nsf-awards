 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to study local search strategies for discrete optimization problems, using \r\nthe generalized hill climbing algorithm framework.  Generalized hill climbing algorithms provide a \r\nwell-defined structure for classifying and studying a large body of local search algorithms typically \r\nused to address a wide variety of (real-world) manufacturing and service industry problems that can\r\nbe modeled as discrete optimization problems.  This project presents and classifies local search algorithms\r\n(including simulated annealing, threshold accepting, and tabu search, among others) using the generalized \r\nhill climbing algorithm framework, identifies and develops convergence results and new finite-time performance measures for such algorithms (that more closely match how practitioners would apply them), studies the implications of these convergence results and finite-time performance measures on particular algorithm formulations, and evaluates the application of such algorithms to manufacturing and service industry discrete optimization problems.\r\n     The results of this research will provide a well-defined structure for comparing and evaluating different types of local search algorithms using a common set of performance measures.  This, in turn, will provide a practical vehicle by which new local search algorithms can be systematically developed, hence provide the potential to efficiently address larger and more challenging manufacturing and service industry problems.  Moreover,  an industrial partner has committed to implementing several such generalized hill climbing algorithms into a discrete manufacturing process design optimization computer software tool that they are developing and commercializing through a Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract.  This tool will also include a visualization capability of the generalized hill climbing algorithm performance measures developed in this project.\r\n    \r\n",
