 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860645\r\n     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will evaluate the feasibility of using computational steering to reduce the time to simulate turbulent reacting flows within fossil-fuel fired industrial boilers and furnaces. Our strategy includes developing a computational workbench with tightly integrated tools for comprehensive turbulent Reacting Flow simulation; leading edge visualization; simple model modification. The new tool will be based on: Reaction Engineering International's turbulent, two phase Reacting Flow models; and the SCIRun problem-solving environment developed by the University of Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging research group.\r\n     The targeted market-sector for the new tool is the analysis of fossil-fuel fired steam generators and other combustion systems. Our intention is to create a computational tool that can put the power of detailed Reacting Flow Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations into the hands of engineers that are not CFD experts. Utility boilers represent an attractive market because of their high capital cost, long life expectancy and increased emphasis on cost reduction and pollution control.\r\n\r\n",
