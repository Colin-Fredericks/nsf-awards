 "awd_abstract_narration": "The functional unit of all muscles, both vertebrate and invertebrate, is the myofibrillar sarcomere, a complex but precisely ordered arrangement of muscle proteins.  The major functional protein components of the sarcomere are myosin, the molecular motor that powers the contractile movement, and actin, which forms the stationary filament (thin filaments) along which myosin moves.  In muscle, myosin is itself arranged in filaments (thick filaments); the hydrolysis of ATP by the myosin molecules results in the sliding of the myosin filaments along the thin filaments, with left-right pairs of thick filaments sliding toward each other, thereby resulting in a shortening or contraction of the myofibril as a whole.  There are additional molecular components of the myofibrils that function in various aspects of the spatio-temporal organization and regulation of the contractile apparatus.  However, the molecular details of the organization of these components are not yet understood.  Invertebrate model systems such as insects (e.g., Drosophila) and nematode worms (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) have proven to be very useful in elucidating the molecular organization of muscle myofibrils because biochemical studies can fruitfully be combined with genetic analyses.  In these invertebrates, a major additional component of the thick filaments is a protein called paramyosin.\r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this project is to understand how the two major thick filament proteins of C. elegans muscle, myosin and paramyosin, are assembled into a highly ordered structure.  The filament-forming domains of myosin heavy chain (myosin) and paramyosin are homologous coiled-coil dimers or \"rods.\"  Dr. Hoppe is interested in defining the parameters of coiled-coil sequence that contribute to specification of ordered structure.  One goal of this project is to test the model that a small C-terminal portion of the coiled coil, the 29-residue Assembly Competent Domain (ACD), is a critical region required for ordered assembly.  In addition to the intermolecular interactions that may be specified by the coiled-coil domains, other proteins are required for proper assembly of thick filaments in vivo.  Both myosin and paramyosin have small, terminal nonhelical regions that contain phosphorylation sites, suggesting that kinases and phosphatases may play important roles in guiding filament assembly.  Unlike the C-terminal myosin phosphorylation sites in smooth and nonmuscle myosins, a potential phosphorylation site in C. elegans myosin lies in a core position in the coiled coil domain.  Preliminary studies from Dr. Hoppe's laboratory indicate that deletions that remove some or all of the phosphorylation sites in myosin result in assembly defects in vivo.  A truncated myosin that lacks all phosphorylation sites acts as a dominant disrupter of sarcomere structure in vivo.  A second goal of the project will be to define the role of these nonhelical sequences and phosphorylation sites in either specification or regulation of myosin and paramyosin assembly.\r\n\r\nThe role of the sequences containing the phosphorylation sites at the C-terminus of myosin and the n-terminus of paramyosin will be defined.  While phosphorylation in nonhelical regions has been recognized as a regulator of assembly in coiled-coil molecules such as myosin, the mechanism by which this occurs is not understood.  To test the role of the tailpiece in assembly, truncated forms of myosin heavy chain and paramyosin will be examined for assembly defects.  To define the mechanism of tailpiece action, the sequence and positional dependence of tailpiece function will be examined by exchange of homologous sequences between myosin and paramyosin.  In addition, to allow interpretation of the dominant defects previously observed in tailpiece deletion constructs, and to enable future studies on the mechanism of tailpiece action, the phosphorylated serine residues within the paramyosin tailpiece will be identified.\r\n\r\nAn in vivo test of the Assembly Competent Domain will be performed.  Two types of mechanisms have been proposed for the specification of intermolecular stagger at which myosin and paramyosin assemble into the thick filament.  Models based on the remarkable charge distribution and the conserved hydrophobicity profile along the length of the rod favor a mechanism in which rod-rod interactions along the entire length of the filament-forming domain act to specify intermolecular overlap.  However, recent work has proposed that a small C-terminal region, the 29-residue ACD, is necessary and sufficient for formation of ordered aggregates.  Site-directed mutagenesis will be used to test the requirement for the ACD in myosin and paramyosin assembly in muscle cells.\r\n\r\nThis work will contribute not only to an understanding of muscle contractile apparatus assembly, but more generally to an understanding of how multiple proteins assemble to form orderly protein structures of precise distribution, diameter, and length.  As such, the project addresses an extremely important problem in modern molecular biology.\r\n",
