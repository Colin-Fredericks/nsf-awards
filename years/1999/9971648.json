Special emphasis will be devoted to the roles of\r\nsymmetry and of singular spaces in the geometry and topology of\r\nRiemannian manifolds.  In particular, one of the guiding principles\r\nbehind the project is: ``Classify manifolds with positive or non-negative\r\ncurvature and large isometry groups.''  This naturally includes the study\r\nof manifolds with ``rotational symmetry,'' i.e., manifolds with one-\r\ndimensional orbit spaces.  This investigation is also aimed at producing\r\nnew examples of manifolds with positive or non-negative curvature, a\r\nproblem of notorious difficulty.  Orbit spaces in general provide\r\nimportant examples of the type of singular spaces that arise in the study\r\nof manifolds with lower curvature bounds.  The investigator's efforts\r\nrelated to singular spaces are focussed on stability and inverse\r\nstability problems.  Answers to such problems will be instrumental in the\r\ndeeper understanding of the structure of Riemannian manifolds in general.\r\n     Riemannian manifolds are an abstraction of curved spaces possessing\r\na distance function.  Unlike curves and surfaces in 3-space, these\r\nmanifolds do not necessarily sit inside an ambient space, hence they are\r\nabstract spaces.  The research here aims to understand various global\r\naspects of these manifolds.  In particular, the investigator is interested\r\nin ways in which the positive or non-negative curvature of such manifolds\r\naffects their global properties, sometimes in subtle and unexpected ways.\r\nProminent among these are various symmetry properties, which will be an\r\nimportant focus of the research of the investigator and his student.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
