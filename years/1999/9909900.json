The goal of the  Congress is to provide an international forum for biomaterial professionals and students to present new educational and scientific information in the multi- and cross-disciplinary area of biomaterials which also includes biomimetics and tissue engineering.  The Sixth World Biomaterials Congress will serve as a forum for the dissemination of rapidly evolving scientific information and knowledge in these areas.  The congress will be composed of plenary and invited speakers, special symposia, workshops and presentations in both oral and poster formats organized in topic areas.  The Congress will provide a unique opportunity for professionals and students to present and discuss their research with leading engineers, scientists, clinicians and health care industrial and governmental representatives.  In addition, the congress provides opportunities for professionals and students to network on research, technical and employment issues from a global perspective.   \r\n\r\nThis award provides support for ten students and young professionals to travel to the Congress. The experience will provide unique educational and career opportunities and thus significantly impact student and young professional career development as well as encourage innovation and collaboration on an international level.  Students and young professionals will be exposed to novel engineering and science tools in the field and they will be challenged by stimulating discussion and workshop topics.  The participation in scientific meetings is an essential activity in the academic endeavor of students working in the biomaterial area.  Not only is it important for them to be recognized as scientists and engineers of value through their presentations, but their participation also teaches them professional principles that are essential for a successful career.  The travel award also emphasizes the importance of acquiring cutting-edge knowledge and research tools, presentation skills and networking skills as a foundation for a successful career in biomaterials.   \r\n \r\nProceedings of the Congress are to be available in Book and CD-ROM format at the time of the meeting. Also, the recipients of support from this award are expected to provide a letter to the Biomedical Engineering and Research to Aid Persons with Disabilities Program describing the benefits received from participation in the Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
