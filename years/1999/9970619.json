McNeal\r\n\r\nAbstract: McNeal will consider several problems which deal with the connection between the complex analysis on a domain in a multi-dimensional manifold and the geometry of its boundary. The research in this project centers on the existence and regularity for operators associated with partial differential equations on such domains and manifolds. There are three main, related problems on which the project will focus: (1) global regularity of some perturbations on the Kohn laplacian on a general, smoothly bounded, pseudoconvex domain; (2) the vanishing of the square-integrable cohomology in the Bergman metric on a pseudoconvex domain; and (3) the existence of solution operators to the Cauchy-Riemann equations which are bounded in Lebesgue and Holder spaces.\r\n\r\nThis project will explore ways that solutions to partial differential equations are affected by the shape of the region where the equations are defined. Partial differential equations are the main tools used to model all physical processes; e.g., flow of heat in a material, propogation of sound and light, lift over an airfoil. Understanding how to solve these equations and the ways that solutions depend on the form of the equations continues to be of fundamental importance both in the development of new technology and for the extension of current theories underlying physics, chemistry, and biology. The hope is that McNeal's project will contribute in a significant way to this understanding.\r\n\r\n",
