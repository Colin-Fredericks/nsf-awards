 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in Psychology at Skidmore College.  The long-term goal is to support the educational development of the students, increasing their relative independence as young researchers.  Twelve student interns will spend eight weeks working with faculty mentors.  Experiences will include designing studies, testing individuals, and analyzing data.  In addition, they will attend workshops focusing on a variety of topics including \"life after college\" as a science major, getting into graduate school, making the most of technological resources, and conducting statistical analyses.  The projects providing the focus for the research experience will include such topics as children's memory for collaborative activities, mechanisms mediating closure processes, the specialized role of the right hemisphere in attentional processing, preschoolers' understanding of individual identify, and personality characteristics associated with personal goals and well-being.  Research interns' capstone experiences will include a mini-conference at which they will present the outcomes of their summer research and a research proposal intended as a draft for work they might continue in the coming academic year.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n",
