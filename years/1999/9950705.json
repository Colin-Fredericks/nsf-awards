 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing materials, printed and electronic, for extending and strengthening computing skills for math, science, and engineering majors, as well as for secondary education majors from these disciplines.\r\n\r\nAlthough computer algebra systems (like Maple) have been with us now for almost twenty years, the full integration of these tools into the math, science, and engineering curricula has only recently begun to be widely implemented. Our project aids and facilitates this implementation in Mississippi. The major emphasis of the project is two new courses that use Maple as the actual programming language for students to learn concepts and structures. Maple offers a friendly, interactive environment that is most conducive for studying programming principles and has the combined power of graphic, numeric, and symbolic manipulation. The courses are being designed not only to stress the logic and algorithms inherent in programming, but also to use, and thus reinforce, the basic concepts learned in the calculus sequence. To maximize the effectiveness and impact of these courses, we are instituting new calculus computing labs and summer workshops.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum materials are being developed in conjunction with the creation of (1) four new calculus computing labs, (2) two new mathematical computing courses, and (3) six Maple workshops (extending over two successive summers). The labs correspond to (but are independent of) the freshman/sophomore courses in our calculus sequence, which are taken by math, science, engineering, and secondary education majors. The mathematical computing courses are junior level courses to teach the principles of computer programming with exercises and projects drawn from concepts and techniques learned in the calculus sequence. \r\n\r\nIt is expected that the materials resulting from the grant will have two forms: (1) Printed: A special purpose LabBook designed to analyze and record results from computing experiments in the calculus labs, a textbook on programming in Maple, and pamphlets on the use of Maple in high schools and community colleges and (2) Electronic: CD-ROMs to accompany and extend the printed material and Web sites to augment the material and disseminate its concepts, \r\n",
