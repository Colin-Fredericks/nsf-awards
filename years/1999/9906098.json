 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER project will lay the groundwork for building classroom\r\nassessment tools for secondary science teachers and students in the State\r\nof Washington.   The investigators will identify the particular\r\nunderstandings of physical science concepts, processes, and nature of\r\nscience for students in grades 6 through 10.  Approximately 200 facets of\r\nstudents thinking will be identified by reviewing existing research on\r\nstudents conceptions and by conducting research in several school\r\ndistricts across the state. Minstrell's Facets of Thinking framework can\r\nbe used to write questions for diagnosing specific problematic\r\nunderstandings and for designing instruction that targets these\r\nunderstandings.  The facets perspective has made substantial and\r\nsignificant changes for about thirty high school teachers of physics.\r\nThis project is to begin scaling-up that perspective to serve about 2000\r\nscience teachers and upwards to 400,000 secondary students each year.\r\nResults of the project will be used during fall of 2000 by the state to\r\nrevise the official version of Washington State Science Assessments which\r\nhas been legislated for grades 8 and 10.  The project will also inform a\r\nnext round of projects that will create classroom, diagnostic tools for\r\nassessment and teaching in the service of better learning.
