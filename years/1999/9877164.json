 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposal is to better understand the structure of \r\n(restricted) deformation rings arising from Galois representations.  For \r\nexample, it is a fundamental problem to relate algebraic properties \r\nof deformation rings to properties of the representations being classified. \r\nThis is, at present, very poorly understood.  Out of analogy with algebraic \r\ngeometry, can one define a suitable cohomology group whose vanishing \r\ncorresponds to formal  smoothness of the deformation ring?  A representative non-trivial example  which we will study is the case of representations arising from finite, \r\nflat group schemes over highly ramified bases.   This example should shed \r\nsome light on more general cases, and it should also have applications to \r\nmodularity questions for Galois representations and elliptic curves. \r\n\r\nThis research is in the area of number theory, which is the branch\r\nof mathematics that is concerned with questions about the integers.\r\nNumber theory is a very old subject, but is full of difficult problems\r\nand significant conjectures. Many of the fundamental problems in the \r\nsubject concern either the behavior of prime numbers or \r\nproperties of the integer solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  \r\nThese kinds of problems can be studied with a vast range of\r\nanalytic, algebraic, and geometric tools.  Such number-theoretic ideas also have important real-world applications in the  development of secure and accurate electronic communications systems. The elliptic curve factorization algorithm is one example of such an  application.\r\n",
