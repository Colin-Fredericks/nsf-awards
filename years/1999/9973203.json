The laser\r\nproblems are singular perturbation problems that result from the\r\ndifferent time scales of the laser dynamical variables or that\r\nappear in the study of delay-differential equations modeling\r\nsemiconductor lasers.  All these problems are motivated by\r\nexperiments that are done in collaboration.  The biochemical\r\noscillator problems are also singular perturbation problems that\r\nappear in models of cascading enzyme reactions describing, for\r\nexample, mitosis.\r\n     An important part of the research activities concentrates on\r\nlaser instabilities.  Lasers are used in many applications\r\n(communication, surgery) and are part of our every-day life\r\n(laser printers, bar code reading at the supermarket, CD\r\nplayers).  But these lasers are often unstable devices.\r\nMathematical difficulties in analyzing the responses of these\r\nlasers have prevented their control.  The investigator and his\r\ncolleagues propose to use more advanced mathematical techniques\r\nin order to solve these problems.\r\n\r\n",
