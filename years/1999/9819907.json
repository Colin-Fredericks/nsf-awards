 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research project is to explore the implications of the Internet for I ) social inequality; 2) deliberative democracy, and 3) cultural choice. A survey will gather high-quality data on current practices relevant to each of these three areas of potential impact. In each case, data will make it possible to evaluate the extent to which two or more alternative perspectives are consistent with patterns of Internet use as they have developed to date.  Questions addressing social inequality and democracy are: Will the Internet increase equality by making knowledge cheaper and more widely available? Or will it exacerbate it, as high-status persons gain privileged access to consequential knowledge about how to use these new technologies? To what extent are people using the Internet for political purposes at all?  Regarding cultural choice, the survey will explore the diversity of the sites that current users visit, and gather data on the extent to which Internet users currently employ search strategies and tools that permit access to much of the Internet or instead restrict choice to a relatively few pre-selected sites.  The study proposes to develop several indicators of these aspects of Internet use with the help of a Scientific Advisory Board of both social scientists and physical scientists highly familiar with the potential social impacts of these technologies. Data will then be collected on these indicators using the rich and nationally generalizable data base of the General Social Survey of the University of Chicago in its Year 2000 sample.  Considerable effort will be expended in collecting data on respondents' use of the Internet that will allow respondents to describe the impact of the Internet in their own words, and in developing codings that will capture the richness of their responses. Like other GSS data, those collected here will be rapidly and readily made available to scholars in a variety of disciplines and research settings. It is expected that most of the questions would be applicable in future GSS surveys in order to track the potential long-tern impacts of these technologies.",
