The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Laura Ferrer-Wreder with support for twelve months to work at Orebro University in Sweden with Professor Hakan Stattin.\r\n\r\nDr. Ferrer-Wreder will study youth adjustment and health outcomes to develop a course of prevention.  In the U.S. there is a growing number of young people at-risk for problem behaviors, such as school failure, high-risk sexual activity, juvenile delinquency and substance abuse. The main focus of this study will be an analysis of existing longitudinal and epidemiological data sets.  This analysis will be used to identify risk and protective factors that predict a specific cluster adjustment outcome.  From this a youth prevention program can be developed.  Sweden is the ideal place to do this research, because studying subjects in a small, homogenous country can alleviate the confounding factors that would be present in data collected from a diverse society like the U.S.  By implementing a psycho educational intervention in a supportive setting such as this, it will be possible to provide the foundation for the design, implementation and evaluation of a large-scale community-based intervention program for at-risk youth in the U.S.\r\n\r\nProfessor Stattin, a pioneer in the field of youth development and longitudinal methodology, has an international reputation in the study of normative adolescent development and psychopathology.  Both Professor Stattin and his university are highly regarded in the field of adolescent development.\r\n***\r\n",
