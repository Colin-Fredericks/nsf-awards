The project is complementary to the recent demonstration of the BEC in the atomic gas systems of alkali vapor and spin polarized hydrogen. The study of the dilute Bose gas regime for helium adsorbed on the 3D connected substrate of porous Vycor glass provides a valuable alternative to the systems of trapped atomic gas.  The He-4 in Vycor system allows access to a wide range of particle densities, ranging from the dilute Bose gas regime to the high-density, strongly-interacting regime, a regime that is currently inaccessible to the atomic gas systems. An initial project will be to examine the variation of transition temperature with increasing density. Graduate students participating in the project benefit from exposure to exciting fundamental physics research and experience with state-of-the-art instrumentation. The provides excellent training for a wide range of careers. \r\n%%%\r\nThis is a condensed matter physics project. The demonstration of Bose Einstein Condensation (BEC) in low density atomic gases confined to electromagnetic traps has created great excitement in the scientific community. In the work proposed here, an alternative approach to BEC will be investigated utilizing 4He atoms adsorbed at low density on the surface of a porous substrate, Vycor glass. At very low temperatures the quantum wavelength of the atoms becomes comparable to the separation between the mobile atoms and the phenomena of BEC occurs. A real advantage to BEC studies in the 4He-Vycor system, is that the particle density can be tuned over the entire range from the very low density regime to high densities comparable to bulk superfluid helium. Graduate students participating in the project benefit from exposure to exciting fundamental physics research and experience with state-of-the-art instrumentation. The provides excellent training for a wide range of careers.\r\n*** \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
