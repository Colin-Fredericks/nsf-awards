Pullin, California Institute of Technology\r\n\r\nIt is widely accepted that LES (Large Eddy Simulation) modeling of turbulent flows represents the most viable path forward to address the need to enable CFD methods to address these technologically and naturally occurring flow fields.  It is also, however, recognized that significant developments must occur for these methods (very likely with significant modifications from their present structure) to fulfill their promise.   The proposed study by Pullin will advance an approach to modeling the subgrid stress field that is, in principle, more directly related to the important physical attributes of the subgrid flow than other, more commonly utilized, models.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that this support will contribute significantly to the development of LES models and it will lead to the preparation of current graduate students who can continue these important efforts.\r\n\r\n",
