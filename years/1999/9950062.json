 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to help two-year college students develop a stronger understanding of science with an emphasis on physics and its applications. This is important because of the large number of students, particularly women and minorities, attending two-year colleges and enrolled in technology or transfer programs. The task of updating physics programs at two-year colleges is difficult because of the many rapidly occurring changes, the distribution of physics teachers, the heavy and complex workload of the faculty, and their lack of knowledge about the needs and applications of physics in the workplace. This two-year national pilot program is providing a series of six faculty development workshops (three each year) for two-year college teachers who teach the diverse talented groups of students found at two-year colleges in the core physics courses for technology programs and other programs. These workshops are acquainting participants with the integration and implementation of technology and active learning strategies in such areas as microcomputer based laboratories, digital video, modeling, computer simulations, qualitative and conceptual exercises, web and internet connected courses, cooperative and collaborative group work, research and assessment in student learning, plus addressing the educational and workforce needs of technicians as they relate to physics.  Each workshop is being led by two-year college physics professors along with university/college physics professors who are experts in developing and/or implementing these approaches. The impact of the workshops are being reinforced by a newsletter and other incentives provided to encourage the implementation of the workshop ideas. This project is facilitating the rapid incorporation of this knowledge and technology at two-year colleges for the students they serve.  \r\n",
