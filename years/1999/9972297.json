 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of schools have moved organic chemistry earlier in their curriculum, some as early as first semester freshman year.  Many other schools would like to consider this option, if only there were a book that presented organic chemistry based on this level of preparation.  At Juniata College we have successfully been teaching such a course for several years, and, using that experience, we are preparing a text that should be useful to anyone else trying to teach organic chemistry to freshmen.  The text supports a course that eases in far more gradually than typical organic chemistry courses, taking time at the beginning to introduce thoroughly those general chemistry topics deemed necessary for the understanding of organic chemistry; reduces the depth and breadth of coverage of organic chemistry, while retaining everything that we deem necessary to biologists; and integrates biological relevance throughout the course rather than waiting until the end.  In addition to the text, materials will be available that suggest ways to modify subsequent chemistry courses to respond to the changes in the first-year sequence.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
