 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nitrogen-fixing prokaryote Trichodesmium is a widely distributed cyanobacteria in all warm oceans and is the dominant known source of planktonic nitrogen fixation in the ocean. Recent work has documented higher levels of nitrogen fixation by these cyanobacteria than historically reported, but these levels are still inadequate to meet the inputs required by geochemical budgets at oceanic sites.\r\n\r\nThe requirement for phosphorus to support nitrogen fixation is an understudied aspect of this problem. There is little evidence of phosphorus limitation in Trichodesmium despite low inorganic phosphorus concentrations (nanomolar range) at both oceanic time series stations (BATS and HOTS). Trichodesmium can use organic phosphorus, but concentrations are low as well and little is known about Trichodesmium's use of these pools.\r\n\r\nOne possible phosphorus source is migration to pools beneath the nutricline. Vertical migration has been documented in several non-flagellated eukaryotes in the open sea to provide access to subsurface nitrogen sources. Trichodesmium is known to buoyancy regulate and has the ascent/descent rates to accomplish such a migration for phosphorus. However, there is contradictory evidence as to whether migration occurs from both in physiological and compositional data.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to examine the characteristics of Trichodesmium spp. in the field to determine if migration is actually occurring. Composition and rate measures to determine this include respiration rates, carbohydrate, protein, polyphosphate, CHN, particulate P, trichome buoyancy, and fluorescence yield via PAM fluorometry. Based on models of vertically migrating eukaryotes, these measures should vary predictably and significantly between ascending and descending cells if P-replenishment is occurring at depth. The program will utilize a Trichodesmium cruise previously funded off of Australia, and 1 cruise in the Gulf of Mexico to compare different populations. The project is not site specific, but rather is evaluating a behavior that has significant implications at both the BATS and HOTS stations.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the project, the migration capacity of Trichodesmium will be confirmed or refuted. This will permit direct assessment of the role of vertical migration for P acquisition in supporting nitrogen fixation in the ocean and will be a significant advance in understanding the ecology of this important genus.\r\n",
