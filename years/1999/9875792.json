Thus, the expectation is that the PI  will not only establish a research program as an independent investigator, but that she will contribute to the educational goals of the university. The career development plan includes two educational objectives:\r\n1) To direct a program of neuroscience outreach and mentoring for Brown undergraduates belonging to groups that are underrepresented in neuroscience, and 2) To continue and expand involvement of undergraduates in my own research program. The PI has planned an outreach program that will interface with existing programs on campus that have the goal of increasing diversity in all academic disciplines. In particular, this CAREER Award will support summer research fellowships for science concentrators that are interested in neuroscience and belong to groups that are underrepresented in neuroscience fields. Students will do research in a neuroscience lab in collaboration with a faculty mentor throughout the summer.\r\nThe research objectives are part of an overall plan of research that will examine the cognitive functions of the cortical regions surrounding the posterior rhinal sulcus in the rat, including the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices and the newly defined postrhinal cortex. The PI  contributed to the neuroanatomical findings that led to more precise boundaries for the rat perirhinal cortex and provided the conceptual basis for defining the rat postrhinal cortex, a region that exhibits considerable homology with the monkey parahippocampal cortex. Subsequent studies indicated that the interconnections among the perirhinal, postrhinal/parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices and their cortical afferentation are even more similar between the monkey and the rat than previously thought. Thus, the rat now clearly provides an excellent model for understanding the function of the cortical regions that surround the hippocampus. A role in recognition memory has already been identified for the perirhinal cortex, but the parahippocampal cortex does not appear to contribute to object recognition memory in monkeys assessed in the standard DNMS task. The proposed experiments will employ multidisciplinary approaches to examine the hypothesis that the postrhinal/parahippocampal cortex contributes to the processing of visuospatial information.\r\n\r\n",
