 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough recent research shows that infants are sensitive to structural regularities in linguistic input, little is known about the degree to which these sensitivities reflect general-purpose statistical learning mechanisms versus innate language-specific 'expectations' about the kinds of structure that will occur. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the nature of the learning mechanisms available to infants and older learners. This is achieved by exposing learners to artificial languages. Use of artificial language stimuli enables more precise control over the learning environment than is found using natural language. Such control enables systematic manipulation and testing of structural factors that may play a role in language acquisition. Prior learning is also controlled, permitting the separation of effects due to artificial language exposure from those due to prior knowledge. Prior research conducted by the Pl demonstrated that infants use both general associative and perceptual pattern matching mechanisms in the acquisition of artificial languages. Pattern-based abstraction is important because it signals a system capable of representing relations among abstract variables. However, the Pl wishes to take the next step in investigating the types of abstraction processes involved in language acquisition. Specifically, the Pl plans to (1) investigate abstraction of distributionally defined categories, and (2) learning in the context of frequently occurring cues. The Pl's previous research investigated learning with infants and adults. The proposed research will incorporate methodologies for testing older children. Infants, young children, and adults will be exposed to auditory sequences generated by artificial grammars. Learners will then be tested to see whether they can discriminate new grammatical sequences from ungrammatical ones. Infants will be tested using the head-turn preference and visual preference procedures. Three-year olds will be tested using computer generated programs with touch-screen interfaces. Five-year-olds will be tested in the context of an incidental learning task. Adults will be tested using computer generated programs. The proposed research is expected advance our understanding of  how children learn language by investigating (1) the abstraction abilities available to learners; (2) the types of architectures and mechanisms involved; and (3) the developmental sequencing of such learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
