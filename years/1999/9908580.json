 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last decade, considerable progress has been made in applying the technology of microelectronics fabrication to mechanical construction.  This field has come to be referred to as MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems), and the devices produced by these technologies are usually nearly planar, having dimensions in the vertical direction of only a few micrometers.  This drawback has led to limited success for these devices as sensors and almost no success for these devices as actuators and mechanisms. To many researchers and practitioners it appears plausible that three-dimensional meso and micro scale systems will have a much wider range of application than the so-called MEMS devices.  Because of the expected growth in many manufacturing areas and what is perceived as a critical need to focus research attention and to develop insights into future directions and applications of three-dimensional micro and meso scale devices, a workshop will be conducted at and jointly with the National Institute of Science and Technology on May 18 and 19, 1999. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together leading industrial and academic researchers and practitioners of micro and meso scale manufacturing for the purpose of identifying processes, measurement methods, targets of opportunity, application areas, and other unforeseen points relevant to this emerging discipline. \r\n\r\n",
