 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine - Dunbar High School NSF GK-12 Graduate Teaching Fellows Program (Hopkins-Dunbar Fellows Program) matches Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine PhD students (Fellows) with mentor teachers at Paul Lawrence Dunbar High School in teaching apprenticeships.  The Fellows receive formal training in classroom teaching and serve as student-teachers in science and biotechnology classrooms at Dunbar High School.  The overall goal of this program is to improve the quality and depth of science education at the high school and to empower the students with improved learning skills.  The Fellows serve as important content resources to Dunbar teachers and allow the teachers to fully utilize biotechnology and information technology as teaching and learning tools.  The Fellows benefit through improved skills in communication, presentation, and organization.  The Hopkins-Dunbar Fellows Program is also helping to foster interest of underrepresented minority groups in biomedicine and related fields.  This program should also have a favorable effect on the pool of local underrepresented minority students interested in careers in science.    \t",
