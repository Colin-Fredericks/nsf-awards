Lerman\r\nColumbia College Chicago\r\n\r\nProf. Lerman has devoted her professional career to engaging students' interest in science, and has taken great strides to \"turn on\" minority pupils to science. Through the Institute for Science Education and Science Communication, Dr. Lerman serves as a role model for the college community by making the Institute a \"home\" for minority students.  Lerman has created an innovative curriculum in which students are encouraged to apply their interests, strengths, talents, and cultural backgrounds to their science coursework.  She established a program of teaching science through dance.  In the community \"Mother Zafra\" has lead a program for parents, teachers, and students of a street gang infested Southwest side (Chicago) neighborhood to increase awareness of and competence in science related matters.  For most of the 16,000 plus students, who have participated in these programs, this is the first time they began thinking about attending college.  \r\n",
