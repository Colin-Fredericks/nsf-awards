 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network systems and applications, including both established technologies \r\nlike wireless voice networks, the internet, and video services and emerging \r\ntechnologies like wireless multimedia, distributed computing, and ubiquitous \r\ncomputing, are undergoing explosive growth.  While these systems differ in \r\nmany ways, a key bottleneck is common to all of them:  The utility of each \r\nof these technologies is limited by the amount of information that can be \r\nsent through the corresponding network. Since bandwidth is scarce, making \r\nthe best use possible of the data rates available is critical.  Thus use of \r\nefficient data representations, or source codes, is imperative for maximizing \r\nsystem performance in network technologies.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research considers new paradigms for source coding in network systems \r\nand compares those paradigms to existing approaches.  The analysis involves \r\ntheoretical proof of concept, demonstration of practically achieved gains on \r\nreal data sets, and development of efficient codes to achieve those gains.  \r\nCurrent work focuses on source coding for broadcast systems.  Broadcast \r\nsystems play a central role in all of the above network technologies, where \r\none system node ``broadcasts'' both common information (intended for all \r\nusers) and specific information (intended for a subset of the users) to the \r\nother nodes in the network.  Existing methods for source coding in broadcast \r\nsystems use collections of traditional (single-transmitter, single-receiver) \r\nsource codes within the (single-transmitter, multiple-receiver) broadcast \r\nsystem.  Current work aims to demonstrate and quantify the gains achieved by \r\nabandoning this approach in favor of source codes optimized for broadcast \r\nsystems.",
