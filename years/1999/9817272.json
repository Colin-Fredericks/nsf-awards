 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multicellular development in eukaryotes requires precise integration of a\r\nnumber of fundamental biological processes.  Environmental or intrinsic\r\nfactors can activate diverse signal transduction pathways that elicit\r\ntissue- or developmental-specific morphogenesis.  Orderly differentiation\r\nand spatial organization of diverse cell types frequently requires that\r\nregulation of cell-specific gene expression be coupled to alterations in\r\ncell cycle regulation.  Ultimately, cellular morphogenesis is driven by\r\nchanges in basic processes controlling cell growth, polarity, and asymmetry\r\nin cell division.  The long-term goal of this project is to address\r\nmechanistic questions concerning multicellular development and tissue\r\nformation using the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans.  As in higher\r\neukaryotes, external and internal signals induce two highly synchronous\r\ndevelopmental events.  Asexual reproduction (conidiation) is characterized\r\nby the spatiotemporal organization of a limited number of differentiated\r\ncell types.  Complex transcriptional regulatory interactions coordinate the\r\nexpression of hundreds of cell-specific genes with critical changes in cell\r\ncycle regulation.  A conidiation-independent set of regulatory interactions\r\ncontrols both tissue formation during sexual reproduction and cell cycle\r\nmodifications required during gametogenesis.  The objectives of this\r\nproposal are directed toward elucidating mechanisms that control\r\nmulticellular development during conidiation, regulate gametogenesis and\r\nsexual tissue development, and integrate these two reproductive processes.\r\nSpecific objectives are focused upon a molecular analysis of the Medusa\r\n(medA), Stunted (stuA) and AnSterile12 (anste12) genes.  MedAp is required\r\nfor commitment to the developmental program, functioning as a co-activator\r\nof a subset of conidiation-specific genes and of unknown function in\r\ngametogenesis.  StuAp is an APSES-domain protein that is an essential\r\ncomponent in integrating developmental gene expression and cell cycle\r\nregulation.  The homeodomain protein AnSte12p is related to fungal proteins\r\nknown to play essential roles in converting distinct signal transduction\r\ninputs into specific developmental events.  A balance between functions of\r\nStuAp, MedAp and AnSte12p with other developmental regulators establishes\r\ncell-specific morphology in Aspergillus nidulans.\r\n\r\nDuring the proposed funding period a series of interrelated classical\r\ngenetic, molecular genetic and biochemical experiments are designed to:  1)\r\nidentify DNA response elements within an upstream enhancer required for\r\ndevelopmentally regulated, but BrlAp-, AbaAp-independent expression of\r\nstuA;  2) begin characterization of novel regulatory factors that bind\r\nthese response elements;  3) determine if stuA overexpression alone, or in\r\ncombination with brlA, alters the cell cycle through modification of G1/S\r\nand/or G2/M checkpoints;  4) continue characterization of extragenic\r\nsuppressors of stuA mutations and extragenic mutations that mimic the\r\nstunted phenotype;  5) functionally characterize MedAp - is it a novel\r\nsequence-specific DNA binding protein?;  6) isolate extragenic mutations\r\nthat suppress medA -induced growth arrest;  7) physically characterize the\r\nA. nidulans ste12 homolog and begin analysis of the biological role of\r\nAnSte12p in Aspergillus development.  These experiments should provide\r\nimportant insights into similar mechanisms operating in dimorphic fungi as\r\nwell as regulatory features that distinguish homothallic and heterothallic\r\nfungi.  These experiments should also provide a greater understanding of\r\nthe diverse strategies used to direct eukaryotic cell differentiation and\r\nresponses to environmental factors.",
