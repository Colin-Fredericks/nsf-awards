 "awd_abstract_narration": "9820538\r\nThe Cleveland Clinic Foundation     \r\nWilliam A. Smith\r\n\r\nThis program will recruit advanced undergraduate engineering students from colleges and universities \r\nacross the United States, to provide the students with realistic, hands-on research experiences.  One \r\ngroup of eight students per year will be recruited for nominally six month employment terms at the \r\nCCF.  Each will select an individual faculty mentor at the CCF, in addition to the PI.  They will also \r\nhave a home school faculty sponsor.  Hiring will be staggered, so that students will have a three-month \r\nterm as a junior engineer, and a term as a senior engineer.  Upon completion, the students will return to \r\nthe homes school, and in collaboration with the faculty sponsor, recruit two students to complete a two-\r\nquarter senior project growing from the CCF experience.  Consequently, the participant will \r\nconsistently advance in independence and responsibility through three stages, culminating as a project \r\nleader.  The CCF will loan hardware, instrumentation, software, and computer access as necessary, to \r\nconduct the home research.  The stimulation of the research activity will extend into the home colleges \r\nengineering environment.  A total of 114 students will be supported, over the proposed five year \r\nprogram.  Interactions will be among the CCF-based students, with the CCF staff, postdoctoral and \r\ngraduate students, with the home faculty, and with home students in and out of the program.  An ethics \r\ntraining component is included.  An aggressive recruiting program will increase the participation of \r\nunder-represented groups in the program.  Similarly, emphasis will be placed on recruiting from \r\n\"teaching\" rather than \"research\" oriented institutions.  Educational assessment and feedback is also a \r\nsignificant component.  Because of this effort, the CCF will have technology to quantitatively improve \r\nand extend its work, and the students will have been exposed to research in a world class facility.  The \r\nparticipants in the program will model research activity to other members of the student body at the \r\nhome school.\r\n",
