Partners include the University of Alabama, Auburn University, the University of Tulsa, and Shelton State Community College (HBCU).  This shared effort will offer an opportunity to study issues and problems associated with the proliferation of electromechanical mechanisms in industry for motion control and other applications including refrigeration systems for superconducting devices.  Presently, no institution or facility in the U.S. is addressing system level issues in this growing field.  This laboratory will allow for immediate and productive research to lay the infrastructure for a larger, center-based effort already being planned.  It will also fill a technological void in electromechanical technology, bridging a science and technology gap to enable widespread adoption of emerging disciplines.  Specific research objectives of the laboratory are: 1) Develop industry electromechanical systems to replace present motion control systems; 2) Provide integrated basic research in the critical technologies for electromechanical systems; and, 3) Develop electromechanical systems to serve new industrial applications.  Sample research topics include: softswitching inverters for industrial applications, detailed industrial application studies, regeneration processes and control, and dual sensor control of electromechanical systems.  \r\n\r\nContinuing education in manufacturing issues will be addressed through a distance learning activity conducted between one of the partner universities and a community college.  EMSyL will also provide Internet access to a variety of technical briefs, application notes, and product briefs to help facilitate tech transfer for industry engineers in the adoption and implementation of emerging electromechanical technologies.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
