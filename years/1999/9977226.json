Sarver \r\nBlack Hills State University \r\nAcquisition of Equipment for a Molecular Genetics Laboratory to Support Research and Training.  \r\n\r\nThis award provides funds to equip a molecular genetics laboratory that will serve as a regional resource for research and training.  The focal point of the award is a Perkin-Elmer ABI 310 automated DNA analyzer, which is capable of a number of different DNA analyses using non-radioactive chemistry.  The ability to use non-radioactive methods for DNA analyses alleviates the logistical problems with maintaining a radioisotope license and will allow the integration of more molecular applications into student training and research. At the present time there is no such facility in the state of South Dakota. This facility will support research in conservation genetics, molecular systematics, and molecular ecology, while enhancing undergraduate curricula and opportunities for collaboration among faculty. This award will enhance the research of four university faculty at Black Hills State University, a wildlife biologist for the state of South Dakota, and a scientist at the Black Hills Regional Eye Institute. The award will also improve research and training opportunities for students at area universities and complement existing projects.  For example, Black Hills State University is in the process of implementing a NSF-CCLI award in conservation genetics in collaboration with Oglala Lakota College on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.  The availability of an automated DNA analyzer will significantly improve the research and training infrastructure in the state of South Dakota.\r\n\r\n",
