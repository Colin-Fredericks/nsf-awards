 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of a multiphoton confocal microscope.  David W. Galbraith: Principal Investigator. \r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nFunding from the NSF Biological Instrumentation Program will be employed to purchase a BioRad MRC-1024 2P multi-photon confocal microscope. The microscope will primarily service 15 faculty users each of whom have active federal research grants, the majority from NSF, totalling about $25,000,000.  It will be made available in the form of a multi-user facility in the College of Agriculture at the University of Arizona. The two-photon microscope is the first of its kind in the state of Arizona, and therefore will also be made available to all interested users at the University of Arizona and those of other institutions within the state.\r\nThe two-photon microscope possesses significant advantages over conventional confocal microscopy.  In particular, it allows analysis of living tissues under conditions that minimize tissue damage, improve the depth of penetration of the light, and allow simultaneous excitation of multiple fluorescent labels. Highlighted projects that will benefit from acquisition of the microscope include:  (a) The analysis of the responses of plants to imposed ionic and drought stress.   This project aims to provide a comprehensive description of the genes and gene products that are involved in this process, and the transfer of these genes into plants for improved resistance/tolerance to these stresses. (b) The functional analysis of expressed genes in maize.  This project aims to catalog the totality of genes that are expressed during the life cycle of the maize plant.  This information should lead to improvement of maize as a crop plant. (c) The analysis of the function of the cytochrome P450 gene superfamily in plants.  This project centers on discovering the enzymatic functions of each of the individual P450 genes (over 340 are expected in Arabidopsis thaliana).  These enzymes catalyze pathways leading to a variety of important plant secondary compounds, of value as pesticides and as anti-cancer agents, amongst other things. In all cases, the two-photon microscope will impact these projects since it enables rapid analysis of features of gene expression that cannot be achieved using other instrumentation. In particular, it enables the scientist to determine where and when given genes are turned on and off, and where the proteins produced from expression of these genes are located within cells and tissues. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
