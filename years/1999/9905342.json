 "awd_abstract_narration": "A commonly-appreciated characteristic of motor skill learning is that much\r\nof it occurs outside of awareness. Particularly at high levels of skill,\r\nwe seem not to be able to articulate the exact movements that make up\r\nperformance. On the other hand, conscious strategies are clearly important\r\nin motor skill learning; consciously understood strategies are at the\r\nheart of coaching and instruction.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of research has been directed at demonstrating that the\r\nconscious (or explicit) and unconscious (or implicit) parts of motor skill\r\nlearning are supported by different structures in the brain; thus the\r\nemphasis has been on the separability of these two components of learning.\r\nLess work has been directed at understanding how these two forms of\r\nknowledge work together. The goal of this project is to examine the\r\nrelationship of implicit and explicit knowledge in motor skill learning.\r\nThe experiments are motivated by a model of motor skill learning that\r\nproposes specific mechanisms by which both implicit and explicit knowledge\r\ncontribute to motor skill learning. There are three aims of the project:\r\n\r\nAim 1: What is the representation underlying sequence learning? Many motor\r\nskills involve learning a sequence (e.g., the notes of a piano sonata).\r\nWhen one learns a motor sequence, what is it a sequence of? Stimulus\r\npositions? Response locations? Muscle movements? I will utilize transfer\r\ndesigns to determine the representation underlying implicit and explicit\r\nsequence learning. \r\n\r\nAim 2: What is the time course of implicit and explicit learning? Some\r\nformal models of motor skill learning suggest that implicit knowledge is\r\ncompiled from explicit representations. Behavioral experiments suggest\r\nthat explicit and implicit knowledge can be acquired in parallel, whereas\r\nbrain imaging work suggests that only one type of representation can be\r\nacquired at one time. This project will address this question directly. \r\n\r\nAim 3: What is the mechanism by which explicit and implicit knowledge\r\ninteract? This project examines the possibility that explicit knowledge\r\ncan support performance on an implicit task if three conditions are met:\r\nthe subject knows that he or she has applicable explicit knowledge,\r\nsufficient attentional resources are available, and the explicit\r\nrepresentation is specific in terms of the spatial targets for movement.\r\n\r\nThese experiments will further our knowledge about the normal operation of\r\nmotor skill learning, and have particular relevance to athletics, and to\r\nskill learning in industrial situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
