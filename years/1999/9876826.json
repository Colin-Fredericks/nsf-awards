 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collection of frozen tissues developed during the past several years has become the largest of its kind in the world.  It is a collection that, although primarily composed of mammalian samples, houses frozen tissue and other ancillary materials from all divisions within the Museum of Southwestern Biology.  Several large, active research projects make use of this extensive collection.  National and international user-based requests for information and samples have increased dramatically with the advent of new analytical techniques and the increasing global rarity of novel genetic material.  Refining this resource would make it much more useful to science.  \r\n\r\nThe Museum of Southwestern Biology (MSB) is a research and teaching facility in the Department of Biology,\r\nUniversity of Mexico, housing important collections of vertebrates, arthropods, and plants from around the world.  The Division of Biological Materials of the MSB houses collections of cryogenically preserved samples ranging from frozen tissues to cell suspensions of plants, arthropods, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.  The mammalian portion of the collection is the largest in the world.  The rapid growth of these collections, in parallel with an extreme increase in user demands fueled by the emergence of molecular \r\nbiology and its broadening use in systematics have created some interesting curatorial demands for the division.  This project will support the resolution of some of the most pressing of these problems.  Specifically, the project will complete the electronic data capture for all samples stored in the division (including maintenance and data capture for currently incoming samples as well as samples whose vouchers are held off-site in other natural history collections); II) Complete verification of data captured samples on the database resulting from voucher specimens; III) Verify species identifications in the Biological Materials collection against voucher specimen catalogues; and, IV) Upgrade the database management program to be accessible via World-Wide Web.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing objective will greatly enhance the ability to serve the user community at large, to allow the division to catch up on its backlog of data capture, and facilitate networking activities among this and other MSB databases, especially those containing the primary voucher information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbiologybiology and its",
