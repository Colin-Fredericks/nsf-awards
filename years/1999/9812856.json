However, poor bonding quality,\r\nparticularly voids, in the adhesive interfaces between the reinforced\r\nconcrete (RC) structure and the composite material can significantly\r\ndegrade the structural integrity that could otherwise be obtainable by the\r\ncomposite material.  In order to solve this problem, this research will\r\ndevelop an electromagnetic (EM) imaging technology for assessing the\r\nbonding condition in the interface between concrete and a composite\r\nmaterial.  Once the voids are detected, they can be corrected by injecting\r\nadhesive epoxy at the time when the composite material is applied on the\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe investigators of this research have completed a preliminary study\r\nincluding development of EM image reconstruction algorithms and simulation,\r\nwhich not only demonstrated the strong potential of the proposed technology\r\nin detecting voids in the bonding interface, but also established a basis\r\nfor overcoming the major technical difficulties associated with the spatial\r\nresolution and speed of assessment in this three-year study.  The major\r\nresearch tasks include:  1) development of a prototype EM imaging device,\r\n2) further development of the EM imaging reconstruction algorithms, 3)\r\nverification of the developed EM imaging technology by laboratory testing\r\non the bridge columns wrapped with composite jackets with well bonded and\r\npoorly bonded interfaces, and 4) field tests for the effectiveness of the\r\ndeveloped EM imaging technology on bridges and buildings strengthened and\r\nretrofitted with advanced composite materials.\r\n****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n9812856\r\nFeng\r\nThe enhanced structural performance of buildings and bridges strengthened,\r\nretrofitted and rehabilitated with advanced composite (carbon or glass\r\nfiber-based) materials has been well demonstrated and the number of such\r\nstructures is rapidly increasing.
