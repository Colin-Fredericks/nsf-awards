 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the 1999 summer program at the Center for Game Theory in Economics, at the State University of New York at Stony Brook (USB), a continuation of a series of annual summer programs emphasizing game theory and its applications to economics, as well as other fields.  Game theory plays a significant role in much of the contemporary research in economic theory and is accordingly a frequent theme in organized activities at outstanding research centers throughout the world.  USB's summer program is unique, however, in its explicit focus on game theory, both theoretical and applied. The strength of this focus is apparent in the membership of the organizing committee which consists of the members of the center plus experts from other institutions in the United States and abroad. The value of the approach and of the proposed summer programs is evidenced by their success from 1990 to 1998, with over 1300 participants. The basic program format includes research-oriented conferences and workshops and, also instruction on selected topics in game theory. Thus, while the primary objective is to stimulate and disseminate new advances in both theory and applications, this summer program serves to make conceptual and methodological developments in game theory available to an expanding group of scholars in economics and other disciplines. At the same time the summer program provides a venue for these scholars to present their ideas and concerns to game-theorists, enabling both to explore fruitful new areas of collaboration..\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the summer program consists of: 1) an international conference; 2) workshops on selected themes; 3) an intensive course.  The international conference lasts for five days. It is organized along the same lines as those held at USB, in the past years, with plenary and parallel sessions, and invited and contributed papers. The workshops normally cover a two-week period. Each workshop lasts from two to five days, and the number of workshops in a given year vary accordingly. The week-long intensive course consists of lectures and discussion on selected topics of general importance for both theory and applications. \r\n",
