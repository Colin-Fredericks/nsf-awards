 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) of the United States, and by the European Commission (EC) of the European Union, as part of an official agreement between the US and the EU about collaboration on Information Technology research. It is targeted towards the topic of \"Large Scientific Databases\". The motivation for research in this area is the rapidly increasing number and size of collections of scientific data that are produced by instruments (such as satellite-borne radar) and simulations (run on computers with very large memories and fast processors). These data collections are very large -- reaching into the petabyte size; they must be accessible to geographically distributed user communities; furthermore they may be a fusion of heterogeneously curated collections. This small (30 person) workshop will examine current research thrusts and formulate the intellectual content for future joint EU/US research projects. The results are expected to lay the architecture for intelligent and thoughtful collaboration in the area of scientific databases in the next century. Information systems motivated by this workshop will allow the scientific fusion of the work of multiple, multilingual, multidisciplinary research groups to be used by others as the basis of new science. The workshop results will be available at http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/euus/.",
