 "awd_abstract_narration": "A protein (designated TDBA12) from tobacco plants has been identified that has sequence-specific DNA-binding activity, and that increases markedly during the hypersensitive response to infection with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and following treatment with salicylic acid.  Furthermore, two genes have been isolated that encode proteins with the same DNA-binding specificity as TDBA12 and which are members of the novel WRKY family of DNA-binding proteins recently found in plants.  TDBA12 is sensitive to phosphatase treatment, suggesting a role for protein phosphorylation in its activation.  Potential target genes of TDBA12 include genes encoding proteins with protective and defensive functions as well as regulatory genes.  Transgenic tobacco plants expressing antisense WRKY genes develop spontaneous lesions and exhibit enhanced chlorosis and necrosis after TMV infection.  These observations suggest a general model in which WRKY proteins may be activated as targets of the protein kinase cascade that is activated during plant defense responses.  WRKY proteins in turn may regulate these responses.  The overall objective of these studies is to characterize further the WRKY DNA-binding proteins.  First, the TDBA12 complex will be isolated to identify the subunits associated with DNA-binding activity and to isolate their genes.  Second, transgenic approaches will be taken to decipher the functions of the WRKY genes.  The phenotypes of transgenic tobacco plants expressing antisense RNAs specific for different WRKY proteins will be characterized.  Third, in vitro and in vivo experiments will be used to determine if specific protein kinases are required for TDBA12 activation and, if so, whether WRKY proteins or their interacting proteins are the targets of the regulatory phosphorylation.  A major effort will also be made to isolate the protein kinase that regulates the DNA-binding activity of TDBA12.  These studies will advance our understanding of the molecular basis of plant disease resistance by revealing new regulatory components and mechanisms important in plant defense responses.",
