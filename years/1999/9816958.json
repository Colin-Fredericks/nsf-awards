 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine genetically heritable dental traits - such as tooth cusp size and patterns and tooth root and cusp number - to estimate the genetic relations among ancient Andeans of Peru and Chile.  The use of such traits is a faster, less costly, and less destructive method than is the analysis of DNA extracted from ancient skeletalmaterials, while still providing valuable information on the genetic relations among ancient peoples. For this study, dental trait data will be collected for a large number of previously unstudied prehistoric Andean human remains. Data will be collected from Andean human remains that represent the earliest South Americans, who were hunter-gatherer populations who lacked ceramics and complex social structure (9500 - 1800 BC ), the earliest agriculturalists (1800 - 900 BC), emerging state-level societies (900 - 200 BC), the earliest empires (500 - AD 1000), and pre-Incaic balkanized societies (1000 ? 1476 AD) from both coastal and highland sites of the northern and central Andes. The dental trait data to be collected by this study will then be used to: 1) test competing hypotheses on the peopling of the New World, and, more specifically Andean South America; and 2) address competing scientific models that account for observed changes in the dental traits among previously examined skeletal populations from northern and central Peru. \r\n\r\nIt has been hypothesized that a single prehistoric migration accounts for all the dental and genetic variability observed among modern native South American populations. According to this model, the Paleoindians - the earliest inhabitants of the New World - represent the only prehistoric migration into South America. However, recently reported genetic, linguistic, and skeletal investigations indicate that there may have been more than one ancient migration into South America. Ongoing research on the dental traits of ancient southern Peruvians and northern Chileans suggests that the earliest South Americans were characterized by dental crown and root traits that more closely resemble those reported for modern Southeast Asian populations, while subsequent food producing (i.e., agricultural) populations are characterized by dental traits that more closely resemble those reported for modern Northeast Asians and indigenous North Americans. This suggests that the earliest South Americans may have their biological origins among different populations than previously thought.\r\n\r\nThe biological relations among ancient Andeans, once evaluated, will greatly contribute to our understanding of critical scientific questions regarding prehistoric human biological variability, the peopling of South America, the relationship between ancient migrations and apparent changes in the archaeological record, and the relationship between ancient migratory events as detected in dental trait data and the observed patterns of molecular and linguistic variability among contemporary Andeans. These questions are of interest to biological anthropologists, archaeologists, linguists, molecular biologists, and the larger scientific community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
