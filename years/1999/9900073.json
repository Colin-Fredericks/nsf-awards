 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate fundamental chemistry and materials science aspects of functional nanostructures with relevance to their characteristics and potential use as electronic devices constructed from single metal nanoparticles(ligand-capped Au nanoclusters) in a scanning tunneling microscope. In situ capping ligand chemical reactions will be explored as a means of device gating. The project includes characterization of electron transport in individual nanoscopic gold clusters and molecularly bridged cluster arrays. Elements of the project include: (1) Effects of capping ligand chemistry on single electron tunneling in Au clusters. (2) Characterization of a scanning single electron tunneling microscope tip. (3) Assembly of molecularly bridged Au cluster dimers and trimers and characterization of their electronic properties. The scanning single electron tunneling microscope tip will be used to characterize the electronic properties of nanoscale metal semiconductor junctions. The approach involves a non-lithographic method being developed to make electrical contact to single nanoclusters and other molecular-scale objects (molecules, dendrimers, etc.) to \"wire up\" single clusters using entirely solution-phase assembly methods. \r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new aspects of electronic/photonic devices.  The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to developing advanced devices and circuits beyond the current silicon device and IC paradigm.  A variety of fundamental issues are to be addressed in these investigations. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.  \r\n***\r\n",
