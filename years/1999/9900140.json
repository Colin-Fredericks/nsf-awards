 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research project  focuses on specific behavior in solidifying metal that relates to the microstructure being formed and the mechanisms of the process. Thin strip casting of aluminum and steel can provide industry with an opportunity to produce netshape products via a process that has lower cost and lower environmental impact in terms of energy and material flow.  Single roller melt drag, twin roller, and two roller melt drag processes were investigated and modeled, with some understanding of controlling parameters being established. In practice it has been found that the quality of the cast strip can be poor, with several surface and microstructural defects occurring. This work will focus on the fundamental analysis of the effects of various operation parameters upon the solidification and cooling of the strip.  Experimental work and stress analysis performed by computational modeling of the solidifying thin strip metal will be conducted. \r\n     This GOALI project will include the participation of Reynolds Metals, Armco, Inc., and Transmet Corporation, with the use of production scale casters at these companies to validate the models developed in this project.  It is expected that the models will provide direct information on the appropriate processing parameters to generate improved thermal flow paths and induced thermal stresses.  It is also expected that this work, if successful, will help the U.S. primary metals industry remain competitive in the global economy.\r\n",
