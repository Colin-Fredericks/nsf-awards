 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the loss of biodiversity frequently is framed in the context of extinction of species occurring naturally in different biomes, reductions in genetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity among crop species also has been common during the 20th century.  A standard response to this problem during recent decades has been the establishment of seed banks and other repositories at selected locales, thereby preserving germplasm in presumably safe isolation from a species' natural habitat.  These ex situ approaches have made living material readily available to plant scientists seeking to develop new hybrids, but they have not enabled plants to develop natural responses to new pests and diseases, and they have reduced the knowledge and awareness of people who previously grew these crops.  More recently, so-called \"in situ\" approaches have been developed to broaden crop diversity within growing regions This doctoral dissertation research project will identify socioeconomic factors that encourage the success of conservation programs designed to promote practices within growing regions designed to broaden crop diversity rather than the more traditional means of maintaining seed banks elsewhere.  This research project will draw on political ecological theory and will be conducted through a comparison of two comparable villages in southern Ecuador, one of which has a legume seed-production program while the other does not.  Field observations and oral interviews based on memory-banking procedures will provide critical data on the levels of legume diversity as well as the social and economic factors that affect production in these communities.  This project will contribute to the analysis of the relative merits of ex situ vs. in situ conservation methods for preserving biodiversity, and it will provide knowledge for those seeking to develop more effective in situ conservation programs.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.",
