In 1999, the Edwards dam on Maine's Kennebec River will be removed, restoring 24 km of the river to a free-flowing state for the first time since 1837. Dr. Thorp and colleagues, including several undergraduate students, will sample fish, benthic and planktonic invertebrates, aquatic plants, and algae at 3 sites in the river immediately before dam removal and 11 months after. A variety of analyses will help the investigators demonstrate effects of dam removal on ecosystem metabolism, the sources of energy supporting the food web, and the complexity of the food web. Because the environmental bases for retaining or removing a dam are not as well developed as the economic justifications, this study will help fill an important knowledge gap in our understanding of river ecosystems.\r\n\r\n",
