 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Professor Messmer of Lehigh University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.  The primary research objective of the proposed work is the development of infrared sum frequency generation to study adsorption and response to mechanical perturbation of thin films self-assembled on silica and graphite.  Understanding of the processes involved may lead to improved lubricants, adhesives, and protective coatings.  C-H bonding and rocking modes in assembled mololayer alkyl chains will be one of the first targets of study.  Simultaneous spectral and force measurements are proposed to unlock changes associated with the frictional effect.  The educational aspect of the proposal focuses on CHEMPals, a mentoring program especially designed to encourage science interest in 11-13 year old girls.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscopic measurements described here are part of a fundamental study to determine the orientation of molecules on surfaces.  The shape of the molecule and its connection to the surface are controlling forces that determine  surface properties such as friction, and understanding of these forces is part of a study to produce molecules that are better lubricants.\r\n",
