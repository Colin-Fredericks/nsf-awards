 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our traditional curriculum is being replaced with a new, more interdisciplinary curriculum which more concretely embraces open-ended inquiry. The outcome is expected to be chemistry majors that are prepared to be problem solvers in a wide variety of fields and in a wide spectrum of careers.\r\n\r\nAlthough our previous curriculum was very successful in preparing our graduates in a traditional sense, it was compartmentalized, with little emphasis on the value of a broad approach to indeterminate scientific problems. We are redesigning the curriculum so that our majors are involved early in their undergraduate careers in open-ended learning activities which span the boundaries of analytical, organic, inorganic and physical chemistry. The new \"Introduction to Research\" course at the sophomore level, and subsequent offerings at the upper level, model the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry and emphasize guided inquiry. In addition, the introduction of a new \"major in chemistry with concentration in biochemistry\" interweaves coursework in the disciplines of chemistry and biology, and amplifies the importance of chemistry in the solution of biological problems. \r\n\r\nIn designing this new curriculum, aspects of successful programs at California State University-Chico, DePaul University, the University of San Francisco, James Madison University, the University of Central Arkansas, and Willamette University have been modified and adapted to create our programmed introduction to research, the use of peer mentors, early introduction to research, group work, the interdisciplinary approach, and improved communication skills.\r\n\r\nIntegral to this curriculum revision is the incorporation of an FT-NMR spectrometer and a GC-MS which enhance our students' hands-on, discovery-oriented learning.  A number of experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education are adapted so that the use of FT-NMR and GC-MS is woven throughout the curriculum.\r\n",
