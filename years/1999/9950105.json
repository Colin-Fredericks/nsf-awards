 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project implements a nationally relevant model for making the community college a focal point for creating Computer and Information Technology (IT) pathways for students in rural regions. This is accomplished by involving three tiers of public education, local and regional government, business and industry, and professional and trade organizations as partners in developing practices and processes uniquely suited to areas without large employers.  The project goals are being met through a series of objectives designed to meet the growing demand from small business enterprises for information technology resources. \r\n\r\nThe project is increasing access for a diverse, rural population to two and four year post-secondary programs in IT training.  It is building upon existing relationships to create a persistent academic stream from high-school to community college to baccalaureate institutions or IT employment. Curriculum is being coordinated and courses are being shared via Internet and distance video platforms. Formal articulation agreements are being drafted and implemented. \r\n\r\nThe project models how small colleges, many with a strong liberal arts tradition, can develop on-going processes to involve small business and education representatives throughout their service areas to strengthen the regional information technology infrastructure. Rural business and industry are full partners in this process, informing curriculum development and providing student co-op work experiences and externship  opportunities for high school teachers and college faculty. Through activities and initiatives developed during annual meetings among guidance, admissions, and transfer personnel, greater numbers of students with diverse backgrounds are becoming involved in IT related fields. Increased computing capacity and infrastructure are being developed and maintained to facilitate inter-institutional cooperation and program development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
