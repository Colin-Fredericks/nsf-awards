The macroscopic view on unbounded metric spaces allows us to extract the essence of several important conjectures in modern mathematics. These conjectures are often called `The Novikov type conjectures', since the first in the list is the Novikov higher signatures conjecture. Among others conjectures of this type are the Baum-Connes conjecture, the Borel conjecture, the Gromov-Lawson positive scalar curvature conjecture, Zero-in-spectrum conjecture. Most of the above conjectures can be formulated in terms of the large-scale geometry of discrete groups. An asymptotic approach to investigation of metric spaces can be accomplished in rigorous frames of special category, called `Coarse category'.  There are parallels between the coarse category and the category of compact (metrizable) spaces. Partly this analogy is established by the Higson corona functor, partly this is due to Gromov's work on cultivating basics of dimension theory and of its dual, connectedness theory, in this new territory. One of the most difficult problems in the theory of compact spaces was the Alexandroff Problem about coincidence of geometric (Lebesgue's) and algebraic (cohomological) dimensions. The problem came from late 20s and it was completely solved only in late 80s by the PI. Suddenly Alexandroff Problem appeared to be important in the realm of coarse category. The corresponding equality for a discrete group would imply most of the above conjecture for that group.  \r\n\r\nThus a local technique of general topology such as dimension theory and absolute neighborhood retract theory can help to resolve problems of asymptotic (global) topology which in their turn would answer very important and difficult questions of `local mathematics'.\r\n           \r\n\r\n",
