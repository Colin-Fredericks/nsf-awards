 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project addresses the longstanding debate on the economic impact of the Cold War by taking a comparative approach and focusing on industrial research. It proposes to illuminate the range of technological, organizational, and economic outcomes firms with different cultures, core technologies, R&D strategies, and levels of dependence on military contracts achieved within the Cold War research environment. It focuses on three areas: the first explores the extent to which ideas resonant among political, military, and scientific leaders during the Cold War concerning the relationship between science and technology influenced the content of military R&D contracting policies. Considered is the hypothesis, advanced by historians of industrial R&D, that a misreading of the contributions of scientific research to the major technological breakthroughs of World War 11 led military leaders to place undue emphasis on contracting for basic scientific research. The second area analyzes corporate strategy and the organization of industrial research from the end of the Korean War to the late 1960s at Westinghouse, Fairchild, Grumman, Boeing, Sperry, Lockheed, TRW, Rockwell, and Ford. Although corporations take center stage in this section, the researcher also examines the relationship between the military and industry to decipher the direct and indirect military influences on the organization of research within firms. The third area deals mostly with industry in the early 1970s. The researcher draws conclusions regarding the ability of individual firms to produce commercially successful innovations and makes claims regarding the overall impact of the Cold War on the United States economy.",
