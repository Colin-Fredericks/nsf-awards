 "awd_abstract_narration": "While most preschoolers know very little about most topics \r\nin comparison to adults, there are notable exceptions.  Some young children\r\ndevelop intense interests in domains such as dinosaurs or trains, and\r\ndoggedly pursue their parents and teachers to provide them with books,\r\nvideotapes, and toys that will help to increase their knowledge in these\r\nareas.  We currently know very little about how such elaborate networks of\r\nknowledge are constructed by very young children.  We know even less about\r\nhow children discover and execute strategies to facilitate their learning\r\noutside of the research laboratory.  While it seems feasible that possessing\r\nhigh levels of knowledge in one area should be very helpful when children\r\nbegin to learn about a new, related area, we know very little about the\r\nmechanisms through which existing knowledge might influence new learning.\r\nThe present research is focused on these issues.  In particular, we aim to\r\ndiscover the mechanisms through which children's existing knowledge and\r\nstrategies influence new learning.  Previous studies have shown that\r\nchildren tend to behave more strategically, gain more knowledge, and feel\r\nmore excited about learning when it is situated within a specialized domain\r\nof information that is considered to be both interesting and highly\r\nfamiliar. Understanding the interplay between children's knowledge and\r\nstrategies can help teachers make informed decisions about both the\r\nsequencing of curricular units, and the timing of learning strategy\r\ninstruction to best facilitate the development of lifelong learners.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
