 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is provided for partial travel support for approximately fifty-five highly qualified individuals to participate in the 12th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, January 30-February 4, 2000, in Auckland, New Zealand.  Without such support, few U.S. researchers will find it possible to participate.  It is critically important that U.S. researchers present results of their current work in this important international forum, if the U.S. is to maintain its recognized leadership in the earthquake engineering field.  The World Conference on Earthquake Engineering is the unique major event, which NSF sponsors to enable NSF investigators to participate and to enhance their research.\r\n\r\nEERI will advertise broadly the availability of travel grants, convene a blue-ribbon review panel to evaluate applications, coordinate travel arrangements, and handle all administrative procedures involved in sending the U.S. delegation to New Zealand.  \r\n",
