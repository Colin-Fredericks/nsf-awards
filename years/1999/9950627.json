 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chautauqua Program provides faculty an annual series of workshops in which research and teaching scholars at the frontiers of a number of science disciplines, mathematics, and engineering work intensively for several days with undergraduate faculty to bring them up to date with the state of the art.  The workshops provide opportunities for participating scholar instructors to communicate new knowledge, concepts, and techniques directly to college teachers in ways which are immediately beneficial to their teaching.   \r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this program is to enable undergraduate faculty in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering to maintain their undergraduate instruction at the highest levels of effectiveness.  To achieve this goal year after year, the Chautauqua Program actively seeks to refresh to the pool of workshops with new education experiences reflecting the progress in improving undergraduate education.  \r\n\r\nThe Chautauqua Program is national in scope.  It is anticipated that throughout the USA these workshops will provide 15,000 faculty with enrichment experiences who will (collectively) impact 2,625,000 undergraduate students per year after year 5.  It is also anticipated that about 5,000 of these faculty participants will be drawn from two-year colleges.  \r\n\r\n",
