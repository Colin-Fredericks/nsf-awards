 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports research on compounds containing metal-metal multiple bonds by Dr. Malcolm H. Chisholm of the Chemistry Department, Indiana University.  Five areas of investigation will be carried out:  (1) synthesis of new dinuclear compounds and their elaboration in synthesis of homonuclear and heterometallic cluster compounds; (2) elucidation of the detailed mechanisms of substitution reactions of these compounds in order to establish general trends; (3) exploration of mechanisms and utility of multiredox reactions between C-X multiple bonds and M-M multiple bonds; (4) synthesis of covalently linked dimers of dinuclear complexes and the study of their physicochemical properties together with small oligomers as models for higher oligomers and polymers; and (5) the preparation and investigation of the properties of M-M multiple bonds in ordered assemblies (such as 1-D polymers, liquid crystalline phases and single crystals) with respect to their anisotropic properties of electron transfer and non-linear optical responses.\r\n\r\nMetal arrays as clusters and chains have useful electronic, magnetic, and optical properties and are also important in catalysis.  This fundamental investigation will explore the synthesis of new arrays and their properties in a systematic way.  Students will have opportunities to learn a broad range of synthetic and physical methods and to extend their studies into materials research.",
