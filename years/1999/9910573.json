 "awd_abstract_narration": "All living organisms from bacteria to human, appear to have a set of built-in-programs critical for coping with deviations from the optimum in their environment.  To do so, they rely on mechanisms for detecting these changes, as well as mechanisms for coping; together, these mechanisms constitute the stress system.  This proposal focuses on a key component of the stress system, the limbic-hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) axis, and what genes are influenced in brain by this 'stress system'.  The LHPA effects its influence via stress hormones called glucocorticoid.  Glucocorticoids are released into blood, and impinge on numerous targets.  The brain is one of the many targets; here glucocorticoids turns brain cells \"on or off\" electrically by acting directly on the surface of the cells (neuronal mechanisms).  In addition, glucocorticoids can act on the genetic code within the neuronal cell to influence factors made by the cell that can have long lasting effects on cells close by, or far away (genomic mechanisms).  Because glucocorticoids work through a combination of neuronal and genomic mechanisms, their effects can be felt within minutes, but can also last long after the stressful event has terminated.  The effects that last longer for longer time can be detrimental (i.e. loss of memory, cell death).  This application proposes to study the genes activated by chronic stress and identify which are directly related to glucocorticoid action.  We use a novel technique called Gene Array that allows us to simultaneously screen thousands of genes, both known and unknown, within different brain areas.  We shall use the funding to improve the sensitivity of this technique to detect multiple genes in brain.  We hope by providing the understanding of the effects of stress in the brain and contribute by providing the refinement of a technical tool that will be valuable to the field of neuroscience.",
