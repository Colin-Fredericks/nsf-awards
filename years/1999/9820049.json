The objective of their research is to study the modeling, identification, and control for self-oscillating systems.  Their approach to this problem involves physical acoustic modeling, energy flow analysis, kinetic modeling, identification, and adaptive control. \r\n\r\nThe US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in control.  This is complemented by UK expertise in modeling and Greek expertise in identification.  The objectives of the project are to develop and analyze low-dimensional universal models for arbitrary self-oscillating systems, develop identification techniques based on linear/nonlinear feedback, and develop direct adaptive control techniques.  Self-oscillating systems are of extremely broad application and intense current interest.  They include aerodynamic systems, aeroelastic systems, thermoacoustic systems, rotating systems, systems with hysteresis, and systems with contact instabilities. \r\n",
