 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nancy Makri is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue her theoretical research on path integral and semiclassical approaches to the dynamics of large chemical systems.   Makri will use an influence functional approach to study the quantum dynamics of a system in a complex polyatomic environment.  She will exploit the structure of the influence functional that allows pairing of the forward and reverse time evolution operators.  This leads to expressions amenable to Monte Carlo integration.  Two procedures will be investigated: 1) a locally quadratic, instantaneous normal mode expansion of the solvent potential; and 2) a rigorous semiclassical forward-backward initial value representation of the influence functional.  Makri plans to conduct benchmark calculations and applications to the dynamics of energy transfer in clusters and fluids.\r\n\r\nThe large majority of reactions that are of interest to chemists occur in condensed phase systems in the presence of solvent.  The theoretical models for treating such complex systems are still in the early stage of development.  Makri is developing new theoretical approaches for dealing with solvated chemical systems undergoing chemical reactions where quantum effects are important.",
