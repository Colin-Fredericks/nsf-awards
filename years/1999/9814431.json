 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding of protein function can only approach completeness if structure, interactions and local dynamics are understood in detail.  In the past funding period, the foundation to experimentally derived motional models for fast local dynamics in protein modules has been established.  The goal was to not only detect the existence of local dynamics but also describe what the motions actually are.  this is achieved by measuring the NMR relaxation behavior for several nuclei associated with a single motion unit.  This data is interpreted in terms of dynamical parameters for the different magnetic interaction vectors associated with the relaxation, from which a motional model can be developed.  In the present work this new paradigm will be extended and refined with new NMR techniques for the description of local anisotropic dynamics of the protein backbone.  Protein sidechains dynamics modeling will be approached in a similar way by measuring dynamical parameters for several different sidechain interaction vectors.  The methods for the measurements of sloe conformational change dynamics will be improved.  These dynamics are often associated with ligand/substrate interaction.  By combination of several methods, structural as well dynamical, one can obtain models for the slow motions.  The methods will be developed with and applied to the active site dynamics of a small ribonuclease and of a flavoprotein.  In favorable cases the new methods can differentiate between correlated and uncorrelated local motions.\r\n\r\nBiological molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA are essential to life.  In order to understand how they function, many of these molecules have been analyzed in terms to their static structures in the recent decades.  While this has yeilded much insight into function in qualitative terms, explanations in quantitative terms have remained elusive.  Most biological molecules can be seen as engines or factories.  Just as real engines ot factories only work when they are in motion, biobolecules have to move to carry out their functions.  Thus, knowledge of how biomolecules actually work can only be complete when their dynamical aspects are studied in addition to static pictures.  This porject will study the molecules in terms of their small-scale motions and will focus especially on dynamics of the active sites of enzymes.  The resulting knowledge will contribute to the basic understanding of life-processes.  For this research the technique of nuclear magnetic resonance at the highest possible magnetic field strengths will be used.",
