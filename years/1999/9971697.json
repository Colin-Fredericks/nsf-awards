For example, it has been known for \r\nmany years that a function of two variables can be recovered completely \r\nfrom its averages on three squares whose sidelengths are pairwise \r\nirrationally related. Since convolution by characteristic functions of \r\nsquares is a standard model for remote sensing of images by arrays of \r\nphotodetectors (e.g., electronic cameras), this fact suggests that a high-\r\nresolution image can be recovered from low-resolution images sensed by \r\narrays of photodetectors placed at three distinct distances from the image.   \r\nRecent results of the principal investigator and collaborators indicate a \r\nstrong link between the theory of sampling on unions of regular grids of \r\nirrationally related sizes.  Several aspects of this type of nonuniform \r\nsampling are to be investigated.  Specifically, (1) higher dimensional \r\nsampling with applications to high resolution tomography and to \r\ndeconvolution from averages over rotated squares, (2) sampling for \r\nfunctions bandlimited to circular domains with applications to \r\ndeconvolution of images blurred by photosensors with circular apertures, \r\nand (3) higher order sampling with applications to deblurring when the \r\nblurring function is a smooth spline. A second focus of the research is in \r\nwavelet applications to tomography. The principal investigator and \r\ncollaborators have shown that the wavelet transform is a valid theoretical \r\nand practical tool for analyzing local aspects of the Radon transform, the \r\nprimary mathematical model in CT.  The principal investigator proposes \r\nto continue this analysis by studying the recovery of edge information in \r\nimages directly from a wavelet-based edge analysis of their CT images.  \r\nThis would have the advantage of constructing an accurate edge picture of \r\nthe original image without the loss of SNR inherent in any reconstruction \r\nor backprojection scheme.  The natural noise-reduction properties of \r\nwavelets should also help in reducing noise in the measured CT data.\r\n\r\nThis research has two foci.  The first is related to the problem of super-\r\nresolution of digital images.  Any digital black-and-white image consists \r\nof individual pixels on which the image intensity is a fixed shade of gray. \r\nIn this case, features of the image at scales smaller than one pixel in size \r\nare invisible to the imaging apparatus.  For example, in a satellite image of \r\nNew York City in which the pixel size corresponds to one city block, it \r\nwill be impossible to distinguish different buildings in a given block.  All \r\nof the buildings (features) will be blurred into a single shade of gray on \r\nthat block. Such an image is a blurred version of a hypothetical \"perfect \r\nimage.\" The goal is always to get as close as possible to this perfect \r\nimage.  It has been observed that certain classical mathematical results can \r\nbe interpreted as saying that it is theoretically possible to take several \r\nblurred images of different pixel sizes and combine them in such a way as \r\nto recover the perfect image exactly.  Perfect deblurring is not possible in \r\nany realistic system but it is possible to significantly improve the \r\nresolution in an image by combining several blurred images in a specified \r\nway.  The principal investigator has contributed to this program by \r\nobserving that the deblurring problem here described is actually very \r\nclosely related to the well-studied signal and image processing problem of \r\ninterpolation from samples.  The principal investigator's work has \r\ndemonstrated that it is possible to provide very simple deblurring \r\nformulas.  The current research project focuses on finding practical \r\nschemes to implement these formulas on computers. The second focus of \r\nthis project is on applications of the technique of wavelet analysis to \r\nproblems in tomographic imaging.  The term tomographic imaging\" refers \r\nto devices such as medical CAT scanners that form very sharp (much \r\nsharper than x-rays) non-invasive images of the inside of an object.  Such \r\nimaging techniques are also used in industrial applications such as \r\ndetection of cracks in metal structures.  The principal investigator \r\nproposes to study the recovery of edge data in images directly from a \r\nwavelet-based edge analysis of their tomographic data.  This would have \r\nthe advantage of constructing an accurate edge picture of the original \r\nimage without the distortion inherent in standard reconstruction schemes.\r\n",
