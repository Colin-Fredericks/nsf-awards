In particular, the PI will show how\r\nvarious types of Artin groups, Coxeter groups, braid groups, Burnside\r\ngroups, and pure symmetric automorphism groups can be made to act on\r\nspaces constructed to have one or more additional properties.  The\r\nability to construct such spaces has long been a goal of geometric\r\ngroup theorists.  Since many of these groups arise as the fundamental\r\ngroups of configuration spaces the pattern underlying much of the\r\nproposed work can be summarized as follows: a topologically defined\r\nspace whose fundamental group is of interest is made to act on a\r\npiecewise Euclidean cell complex whose structure is understood well\r\nenough to have computational comsequences for the group involved.  The\r\naim of this project is to increase the number and variety of groups to\r\nwhich thiss type of procedure can be applied.\r\n\r\nThis type of project continues the recent emphasis within geometric\r\ngroup theory on the practical, computational aspects of mathematics.\r\nThe results under consideration will not merely show the existence of\r\nvarious objects, but will provide algorithms for their construction\r\nand bounds of the complexity of the procedures involved.  Thus all of\r\nthe work described can be implemented as a computer software package\r\nwhich performs these types of computations.  This explicit emphasis on\r\nthe algorithms and their complexity makes geometric group theory a\r\nclose relative of theoretical computer science and of the real world\r\napplications of these techniques.\r\n",
