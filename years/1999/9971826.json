One goal is to continue the study of cocycles with values in Lie groups and in diffeomorphism groups over hyperbolic actions.  In particular we would like to generalize Livsic's cohomological result, as well as the cohomological results of Katok-Spatzier and Katok-Nitica-Torok, about higher-rank abelian actions to various classes of non-abelian cocycles. The second goal is to use cohomological results as a tool in the rigidity theory of hyperbolic or partially hyperbolic abelian group actions, and higher rank lattice actions on compact manifolds. This goal is part of the rigidity program initiated by Zimmer, and developed by Hurder, Katok, Lewis, Margulis, Nitica, Qian, Spatzier, Torok, Zimmer, and others.  The third goal is to find generic classes of partially hyperbolic transformations with interesting dynamic and stochastic properties.  This is part of a program initiated by Pugh and Shub. The aim of the program is to show that stably ergodicity occurs much more frequently than expected, and that some partial hyperbolicity is sufficient to prove stably ergodicity. We are mostly interested in skew-products and perturbations of skew-products.  This project targets the field of dynamical systems. \r\n\r\nThe theory of dynamical systems is a major mathematical discipline that is intertwined to all the other areas of mathematics. Concepts coming from dynamical systems have inspired researchers from other sciences (e.g., statistics, mathematical physics, biology, engineering).  They also stimulated the emergence of a new area called nonlinear dynamics, or chaos theory. An important feature of the well understood examples with chaotic dynamics is the presence of hyperbolicity (i.e., expansion and contraction). Many natural examples of dynamical systems that appear from practical applications exhibit only partial hyperbolicity. One of the goals of the proposed research is to show that one can find chaotic behavior for these examples as well. Another goal is to find obstructions to chaotic behavior for partially hyperbolic systems.\r\n\r\n",
