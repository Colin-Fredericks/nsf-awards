 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tDeformation properties of metals are typically established in a controlled laboratory environment.  The resulting mathematical models are then applied to complex processes of the modern industrial facility -- with success often impaired by the disparity between theory and practice.  This Career Award supports research into the coordination of experimental test regimes and detailed computer models for metal behavior.  Augmenting experimental trials with computer simulation, detailed examination is made for processing pathways having complexity between a routine laboratory test and a plant production practice. The goal is to improve the predictive capability of computer models, then utilize the simulations to further development of novel, more efficient processes. \r\n\tThis exercise of physically motivated models in a manner that bears insight to practical industrial processing quite naturally encourages application of classroom knowledge to real-world practice.  Projects for incremental improvement - motivated through industrial liaison - are of ideal scope for the senior-level undergraduate design course. Here, the undergraduate gains gentle introduction to modern engineering practice.  The multidisciplinary aspect of the research necessarily leads the graduate student toward interaction with researchers in both industry and government laboratories.  Viewed as a whole, this research and educational program renders a path for professional development with both a foundation in basic science and application to industry.\r\n",
