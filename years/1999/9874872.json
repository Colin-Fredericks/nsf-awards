 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad objective of the research program is to investigate the use of supplemental passive energy dissipation in precast concrete wall and frame building structures.  The greatest disadvantage of precast concrete structures in seismic regions is an increase in lateral displacements as a result of small inelastic energy dissipation.  It is now possible to reduce these displacements by using supplemental passive energy dissipation.  \r\n\r\nThis research will conduct a fundamental, integrated analytical and experimental investigation on the use of supplemental passive energy dissipation in steel and monolithic cast-in-place concrete structures and assessment of these systems.\r\n\r\nThis project will ultimately develop seismic design and analysis guidelines and recommendations for precast concrete structures with supplemental passive energy dissipation.  \r\n\r\nThe broad objective of the education program is to provide a more effective environment for undergraduate and graduate level education in concrete structures and earthquake engineering by developing dynamic, interactive \"virtual laboratory\" modules using the World Wide Web (WWW).  These modules will be developed using recent advancements in the WWW, such as Java applets, to demonstrate fundamental information on the seismic behavior and design of concrete sections, members, and structures.  The modules will allow the students to configure the system parameters (such as geometry, reinforcement, concrete confinement, material properties, loading, etc.) and observe the effects of these changes on behavior.  These capabilities will allow the students to interactively configure and conduct their own examples, \" what if\" studies, and experiments on the web.  The proposed WWW modules will include on-line help as well as theoretical background on the subject matter.\r\n\r\nThe modules will be used by three courses taught by the PI and will be available for use by other education institutions and practicing engineers throughout the world, through the internet, and will be conducted in collaboration with professional bodies and trade association such as the Portland Cement Association (PCA) and the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI).\r\n",
