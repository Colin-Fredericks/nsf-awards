 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most pervasive questions in evolutionary biology is; how does speciation takes place. To address this question, Drs. Feder, Roelofs and Berlocher will be examining the genetic architecture for both the behavioral components and the life history responses to seasonality in a complex of very similar host races in the genus Rhagoletis, tephritid fruit flies.  Species in this genus have long been an excellent model for the study of speciation and this work builds on this solid basis.  In a well-orchestrated project, these investigators will bring the tools of molecular genetics and chemical ecology to bear on this problem.  Using two interfertile host races which vary in the traits of interest, the locations for genes responsible for behavioral components of host plant selection, including the responses to plant produced volatile chemicals,  will be mapped.  Genes for determining when the inactive, over wintering phase of the life cycle ends will be mapped as well.  These traits are known to be of important in maintaining the separateness of the host races in nature.\r\n\r\nResults of this work will provide important insights regarding the mechanism of speciation.  In addition, the project will support research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students.  Finally, tephritid fruit flies are important agricultural pests so that the basic understanding regarding speciation in this group, while of general scientific interest, may also have relevance for pest control.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
