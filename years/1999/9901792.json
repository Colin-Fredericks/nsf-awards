 "awd_abstract_narration": "This objective of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to prepare improved monolithic carbor electrodes for ultracapacitors.  Ultracapacitors, because of their high rate of charge and discharge, are prime candidates for use as the load-leveling power source in electric vehicles, premium power systems and battery powered electronics.  The most important parameter in determining the power and energy density of a carbon-based ultracapacitor is the amount of surface area accessible to the electrolyte.  This in turn is primarily determined by the pore size distribution.  The major problem with current monolithic carbons is that their pores are too small for the electrolyte to enter.  TDA Research, Inc.  has developed methods to prepare porous monolithic carbon with the correct pore size distribution.  The process is considerably simpler than previous methods and uses low-cost feedstocks and processing steps, greatly lowering the production cost.  This combination of improvements will allow us to attain the cost and performance targets necessary to make ultracapacitors commercially viable power sources.  In this Phase II program, TDA will further improve the properties of the materials, develop methods for mass production, estimate their cost in large scale production, and supply pre-production quantities of these material to ultracapacitor manufacturers.\r\nIn addition to use as the load-leveling power source in electric vehicles, improved ultracapcitators will be more cost-effective in current markets (calculators, watches and electric razors), on-going communications markets (cellular telephones and digital communicators) and premium power markets (clean power/filters).\r\n",
