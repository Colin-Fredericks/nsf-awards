 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of a Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS)\r\nAbstract - 9977224\r\n\r\nOne of the most powerful approaches in biology is reductionism, the process of break-ing down complex systems into their component parts, the better to understand their interactions in the whole.  A FACS machine allows for the enrichment of specific sub-populations of cells from large, diverse starting populations based on their expression of specific \"markers\".  These surface markers are detected by binding of fluorescently-labeled specific antibodies that glow when exposed to the UV laser in the FACS ma-chine. \r\n\r\nA diverse population of researchers at UCI has an equally diverse range of interests. These interests can be grouped into four broad areas.  These represent just some of the many research and teaching projects on campus that will benefit from a FACS machine.\r\n\r\n1.\t Isolation of white blood cell (WBC) subsets.    Experiments are proposed that require isolating specific subpopulations of WBC to look at their role in protecting indi-viduals from infection by the parasite T. Cruzi.  Infection by this organism is a major cause of heart disease in South America.  Other investigators will isolate subpoulations of WBC to look at their role in diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis. \r\n\r\n2.\tIsolation of cells in distinct stages of the cell cycle.    Experiments will be per-formed to test the effects of specific growth factors on regulating cell division.  Regula-tion of cell growth is important both in development and in cancer, which is an uncon-trolled growth of tumor cells.  A FACS machine is particularly well-suited to perform these kinds of experiments.\r\n\r\n3.\tIsolation of minority cell populations.    In many cases, both within science and without, the rarest examples are often the most intriguing.  Several investigators are in-terested in collecting rare, but important, cells from the body for analysis.  Some of these cells help protect us against certain diseases, others may carry a disease.  The FACS machine is very good at finding that one-in-a-thousand cell that is of interest.\r\n\r\n4.\tEnrichment of transfected cells.     Transfected cells are cells that have been genetically altered in the laboratory so that they express new genes.  One day it is hoped that people may be helped by giving them  back such altered cells to compensate for a genetic abnormality.  In the meantime the FACS machine is used in the lab to en-rich for these cells so that they can be analyzed in greater detail\r\n\r\nIn summary, a myriad of research and teaching projects at UCI will be facilitated and greatly enhanced by the acquisition of a state-of-the-art FACS machine.  Unlike \"all the king's horses and all the king's men\" we believe we can put the pieces back together again, and in so doing gain a greater understanding of complex biological systems.\r\n\r\n",
