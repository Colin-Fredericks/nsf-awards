They plan to study and analyze the telecommunications market in Egypt and define the needs and requirements of the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and the constraints and needs of the society and the evolving Internet.  They plan to build a framework and develop a tool that can be used by the ISPs and other telecommunications agencies to improve their performance and help with the capacity planning and bandwidth provisioning for Internet Protocol (IP) backbones that will service multimedia applications.  The two scientists will collaborate on the development of the bandwidth optimization and capacity-planning framework.  The analysis will be based on recent developments in the IP technology such as Ipv6, mobile IP, multicasting, and asymmetrical satellite based services for rural areas.\r\n \r\nScope: Dr. El Zarki is recognized for her scientific and academic accomplishments and for her early involvement at Columbia University's NSF-supported Telecommunications Center.  Dr. Kamel has major scientific responsibilities in development and management of computer networks and in the Internet society in Egypt.  El Zarki and Kamel's laboratories in the United States and in Egypt respectively have excellent and complementary facilities to conduct this research.  The proposed activities could lead to development of tools for the newly emerging multimedia applications that require stringent Quality of Service (QoS).  The results will be especially useful in developing countries where the cost of capacity resources is a crucial limiting factor in the development of high-speed communications.  A graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania will participate in the research, and will gain experience in an international science activity.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
