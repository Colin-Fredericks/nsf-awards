 "awd_abstract_narration": "9819788\r\nBrualdi\r\nThe Department of Mathematics of the University of Wisconsin-Madison \r\nhas a tradition of excellence in graduate education that goes back \r\nmore than 100 years, successfully training more than 900 PhDs in \r\nMathematics who now occupy important positions in universities and \r\nindustries throughout the USA and indeed the world. For more than 25 \r\nyears it has had a successful postdoctoral program (the Van Vleck \r\nprogram), with more than 80 Mathematics PhDs continuing their \r\ntraining in research and instruction under the mentorship of \r\nestablished researchers and educators. Our proposal seeks to \r\nsustain, strengthen, enhance, revise, and integrate the five areas of \r\nmathematics education at UW-Madison: (1) Mathematics Undergraduate \r\nEducation, (2) Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics \r\nUndergraduate Program (AMEP), (3) Mathematics PhD Program within the \r\nDepartment of Mathematics, (4) Applied Mathematical Sciences \r\nInterdisciplinary Program within the Center for Mathematical Sciences \r\n(GPAMS), and (5) Postdoctoral Training in Pure and Applied \r\nMathematics. \r\n\r\nOur primary goals are (1) to broaden the mathematics education of \r\nundergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows so that \r\nthey will be able to (a) interact and communicate effectively with \r\nscientists and engineers (b) carry out mathematical research at a \r\nvery high level, and (c) appreciate the role of computing in the \r\nmathematical sciences and, when appropriate, perform computations; \r\n(2) strengthen our traditional undergraduate, graduate, and \r\npostdoctoral programs in core mathematics, and (3) decrease the time \r\nto PhD degree to an average of 5 years or less. The components of \r\nour proposal integrate research and education in pure and applied \r\nmathematics, at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate level \r\nin order to train mathematical scientists capable of handling the \r\nabove noted tasks.\r\nHighlights of our new initiatives include:\r\n 1.  Laboratory Components of Undergraduate Courses A laboratory                                                           component in one or more courses will be developed that will  clearly                                                       illustrate the successes and limitations of Applied Mathematics Modeling                                                             of physical problems. The experiments would be demonstrations carried                                                             out to clearly illustrate points and not to train students for experimentation.                                             Potential courses for such a component are: Applied Dynamical Systems and \r\nChaos, PDEs, Introduction to Applied Mathematics, and undergraduate and                                                   graduate Fluid Mechanics. \r\n\r\n2. Integrated Undergraduate, Graduate, and Faculty Research Lab in Spatial                                       Systems\\noindent Individually and in groups, students will study various                                                       spatial systems (mostly on lattices) from combinatorial and probabilistic                                           perspectives, with some use of computer simulation. Research questions that                                                  arise in faculty and postdoctoral fellowsresearch will be described to students                                                who investigate these and other questions that surface in their course of                                                 investigation. This Lab will meet in late afternoon, and we shall seek out one or                                                  two bright high school students as possible participants, e.g. students from local                                               high schools who are among the winners of the Wisconsin Math., Engin., & Science                                     Talent Search. \r\n \r\n3. Mathematics PhD Program and GPAMS. With the effective use of VIGRE \r\nfunds, we will: \r\n(a) Recruit quality American graduate students with offers of \r\ntraineeships (VIGRE fellowships and Teaching Assistantships);\r\n(b) Provide graduate students with a quality graduate program, \r\nincluding interdisciplinary training that giving experience \r\nin solving practical mathematical problems; \r\n(c) Reduce the time-to-degree by targeting substantial fellowship \r\nmoney on a small group of students who have the potential of becoming \r\nresearch mathematicians at top universities and labs.\r\nCognizant of the fact that many graduates do not work in academic \r\nsettings, we plan to widen the scope of the current Mathematics PhD \r\nprogram in the Department of Mathematics, supplying our graduate \r\nstudents with the necessary experience in solving practical \r\nmathematical problems. To these ends, we are planning to start an \r\n Applied Mathematics Consulting . This would take the \r\nform of nonstandard graduate courses for mathematics graduate \r\nstudents whose main goal is to set up interdisciplinary cooperation, \r\nat a research level, between mathematics graduate students and \r\nresearchers in other fields at the University. Students would take \r\nthis two-semester course in their second year, supervised by a \r\nfaculty member in the Department of Mathematics, with the help of \r\npost--doctoral fellows funded through VIGRE. The goals of this \r\nproject are to foster new connections between researchers in \r\nmathematics and other disciplines and to encourage interaction \r\nbetween mathematics graduate students and faculty in other \r\ndisciplines.\r\n\r\n 4. Post-Doctoral Training ProgramOur post-doctoral program -                                                                        the Van Vleck (V^2) program has attracted some of the best  recent PhDs:                                                       each V^2-postdoc has a faculty mentor for both research and teaching, and                                                  teaches two courses a semester.  They collaborate with faculty, work with                                                         PhD students, participate in seminars, and teach elementary and advanced \r\nundergraduate courses and, at least once, a graduate course. The \r\nV^2--program is an extension of our graduate program providing \r\ncontinuing (collaborative) research and teacher training for new \r\nPhDs.\r\n\r\nWe will extend and strengthen our postdoctoral program, to \r\ninclude a Vigre Van Vleck component, the V^3--program. We propose \r\nto award several V^3--postdocs. The post--doctoral fellows will \r\nprovide essential mentoring to the graduate students with \r\ninterdisciplinary postdocs mentoring students in GPAMS. The \r\ninterdisciplinary post--doctoral fellows will also participate                                                                             in the Applied Mathematics Consulting Program previously described. \r\nV^3--postdocs will be supported in part by regular teaching duties \r\n(one course each semester). They will be: (1) mentored by local \r\nfaculty, develop an independent research program, and improve \r\nteaching skills; (2) develop communication skills through \r\npresentation of research seminars, including one colloquium talk for \r\na general audience; (3) prepare papers for publication in \r\nprofessional journals; (4) prepare a research proposal for \r\nsubmission to a funding agency at the conclusion of her or his \r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nAs part of our VIGRE program, we will, in addition, develop several new                                           undergraduate and graduate courses, including a Mathematics College                                                           Teaching Course (How to teach Math at the College level). \r\n\r\nFunding for this award is provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences\r\nand the MPS Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.",
