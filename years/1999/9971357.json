There are certain\r\nsituations where a symmetric but singular solution of a\r\ngeometrically defined variational problem exists.  Under suitable\r\ncircumstances, techniques from Morse theory can be used to deduce\r\nthe existence of additional nonsingular solutions of the same\r\nproblem.  The second direction is is related to the problem of\r\nfinding complete hyperkahler manifolds.  There are results of\r\nBando-Kobayashi and Tian-Yau which give the existence of\r\nRicci-flat Kahler metrics on quasiprojective varieties realized\r\nas complements of suitable anticanonical divisors in Fano\r\nvarieties.  It appears to be a very restrictive condition on\r\nthese metrics that they should be hyperkahler.  However, if one\r\nrelaxes the smoothness conditions on the divisor, one knows\r\nnontrivial examples exist.  We propose a search for nontrivial\r\nPoisson structures on projective varieties which might be\r\nassociated with complete hyperkahler metrics.\r\n\r\nThe work in the first part of the proposal was motivated by a\r\nquestion asked by a physicist who works on the theory of gravity.\r\nThere are certain special solutions of the system of equations\r\ndescribing gravity in the presence of a Yang-Mills field which\r\nhave attracted a great deal of attention over the past decade\r\nbecause they have no singularities, i.e. no black holes.  There\r\nis an infinite family of solutions to this system of equations,\r\nand they approximate a black hole solution in the limit.  The\r\nquestion asked was whether or not one can explain the existence\r\nof these solutions based on the symmetry in the problem and the\r\n\"shape\" of the space of candidate solutions.  This problem is\r\nvery difficult, but there is an analogous problem involving\r\nharmonic maps between spheres (trying to fit one sphere inside\r\nanother as efficiently as possible) which is more accessible.\r\nThe second part of the proposal involves an attempt to find\r\nexamples of geometric spaces called hyperkahler manifolds.  These\r\nhave been objects of intense interest over the past 20 years or\r\nso, for a number of reasons.  They arise in algebraic geometry,\r\nbut also are related to issues in classical and quantum\r\nmechanics, and have made an appearance in various formulations of\r\nstring theory.\r\n",
