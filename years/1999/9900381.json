Particles in this size range are not presently available and are of interest for making higher strength, more stable magnetorheological fluids.  Two techniques are examined to create metal particles in this size range.  The first is a technique based on reduction of metal salts using iron sulfate and cobalt chlorides as precursors.  Synthesis is conducted under an argon atmosphere to limit surface oxidation.  An applied magnetic field controls particle shape and a mixture of ethanol and water controls the particle size. Adsorbed water removal and improved crystallinity results from additional processing.  A second route to this particle size range employs spark erosion, and it must be determined if this process can make reasonable quantities of the powders.  Prof. Berkowitz at UC-San Diego assists in the spark erosion approach.  The particles are characterized by transmission electron microscopy including Lorentz microscopy.  Samples of the MR fluids will be prepared from the powders and characterized in a rheometer.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is SGER a high-risk project aimed at creating mesoscale-sized particles of iron and iron-cobalt particles.  These particles are considered to be ideal for employment in novel, stable magnetorheologial fluids.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
