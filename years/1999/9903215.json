 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr David Kingery, MS Aniko Bezur will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will sample and analyze a series of copper artifacts which were manufactured during the Middle Sican period (900-1100 AD) on the northern coast of Peru. For a number of years an archaeological research project under the direction of Dr. Izumi Shimada has traced the rise and subsequent decline of the Sican state and has excavated large numbers of copper objects such as needles, tweezers and metal bells. Sican peoples mastered and refined the art of copper working and the project has uncovered remains of smelters and byproducts associated with this process. Through experimentation much of the manufacturing procedure has been reconstructed and MS Bezur will augment this work through the compositional analysis of finished products. Samples will be mounted in epoxy, polished and then analyzed by electron microprobe to determine the average composition of the sample surface. Variation of arsenic content within the microstructure will also be determined through elemental mapping. This information, along with optical images will provide insight into how original solidification took place as well as the history of thermal treatments that the artifact underwent during production. Neutron Activation Analysis will also be conducted at the University of Missouri reactor.\r\n\r\nThe project has several goals. It will help to determine the degrees of sophistication and control that Sican metallurgists possessed. Prior work has indicated that addition of small amounts of arsenic to copper can increase its performance capabilities and that percentage of arsenic varies among objects. However scientists do not know whether prehistoric artisans recognized the advantages which arsenic conferred and controlled the formula accordingly or whether arsenic is incorporated as an unintentional byproduct. It is possible that amount of arsenic varied by artifact type and MS Bezur will analyze a variety of kinds of tools for this reason. Archaeologists do not know how important a role metallurgy played in ancient Peru and the extent to which it contributed to the rise of early state level organizations in the region. Studies to date have focused on artifacts recovered in tombs and other ritual contexts only and its general usage is not understood. MS Bezur's research will set this technology in a broader cultural context.\r\n\r\nThis project is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase understanding of the relationship between technological and social organization and assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
