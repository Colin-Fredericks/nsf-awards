 "awd_abstract_narration": "9901570\r\nDecowski\r\nNumber of longitudinally polarized electrons (i.e. electrons with spins\r\nparallel or antiparallel to the direction of their motion) scattered from \r\nlongitudinally polarized nucleons depends on relative orientation of electron and nucleon spins. Configuration in which the spin of the interacting electron and the spin of a residing in the nucleon struck quark are antiparallel is more favorable because of the spin carried away by virtual photon exchanged in the interaction. Hence, the precise measurement of asymmetry in scatttering of longitudinally polarized electrons from longitudinally polarized nucleons yields information on the composition of the nucleon spin. A very naive picture, based on symmetry arguments, suggests that such asymmetry should not be observed at small angles when the nucleon \r\nspin is oriented in the direction transverse to the direction of electron spin.  However, higher order effects involving subtle interference effects lead to a small nonzero asymmetry. Different theoretical calculations do not converge on the magnitude of this effect which is extremely sensitive to assumptions in various theoretical approaches. The purpose of the E155x experiment at SLAC is the precise measurement of this asymmetry in protons and neutrons. It will be \r\nan important test of the existing theories based on the Standard Model.  Similarly, the very precise measurement of very small asymmetry caused by parity violating admixture in scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons from unpolarized electrons, the goal of the planned E158 experiment at SLAC, will yield another test of the Standard Model by precise tracing the dependence of this admixture on the transfered momentum.  The award will grant participation of a number of Smith College women students in both forefront experiments. They will be involved in most aspects of the E158 experiement, including \"hands-on\" work on building and testing the detection system during the summer months, and in part of the E155x data analysis. This awards affords an opportunity for young women at one of the premier womens colleges in the U.S. to participate in scientific research at the cutting edge.   \r\n",
