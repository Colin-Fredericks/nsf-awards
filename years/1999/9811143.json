 "awd_abstract_narration": "9811143  Cathles     Cornell University  Title: 3D modeling of hydrothermal venting at fast-spreading  mid ocean ridges    The  remarkable uniformity in the spacing of mid-ocean ridge  vents and volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (thought  to  have formed at ancient ridges) has long been recognized  but  remains unexplained.  Also not understood is the reason  for  the size distribution of deposits formed at the same time in  ~40  km  diameter massive sulfide \"camps\".  Furthermore,  in  two  well-defined cases we have studied, the spacing of both  vents and deposits is about 1/3 that expected from the depth  of   burial  of  the  sill-shaped  heat  source.    However,  numerical   models  we  have  constructed  show  that   this  discharge  spacing can be explained if it is  controlled  by  the  thickness at which the thermal boundary above the sill-  shaped  intrusion first becomes convectively  unstable.   In  this  case,  the spacing of hydrothermal vents (and  massive  sulfide  deposits)  provides a  direct  measure  of  crustal  permeability,   an  important  geological  parameter.    Our  numerical modeling also shows that forced convection at sill  edges  (corresponding perhaps to deval offsets of  mid-ocean  ridges) can be an order of magnitude stronger than the  free  convection which occurs over the sill interior.  This may be  the  fundamental  explanation for the size  distribution  so  commonly  observed  in  massive  sulfide  deposits.    These  phenomena  and  others will be investigated  by  2D  and  3D  numerical computer modeling under funding from the NSF.   It  is expected that the work will advance understanding of both  convection  at  mid-ocean ridges and the  spacing  and  size  distribution of massive sulfide deposits, and simultaneously  benefit both science and the exploration industry.",
