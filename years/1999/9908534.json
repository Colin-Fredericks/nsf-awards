 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support for the above Topical Conference within the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Annual Meeting to be held in Dallas, Texas. Dr. Barbosa-Canovas and Steve Lombardo (Coca-Cola Company) are co-chairs of the meeting. This conference series is the only food meeting that specifically seeks to combine engineering fundamentals with basic principles of food science to insure that the latest scientific and engineering advances are disseminated to researchers in the field. The theme of the 1999 conference is on food engineering priorities for the 21st century and the integration of food engineering with other engineering disciplines.  Among the key sessions are many of current interest to BES and our community of researchers:\r\nStructure and function of biopolymers\r\nMembrane separations\r\nSensors and control in food processing\r\nAdvances in fermentation technology\r\nBiotechnology advances for use in food processing\r\nFood engineering education\r\n\r\n     The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for U.S. academic researchers to network and develop collaborations with a large group of industrial food engineers and scientists.\r\n     The proposal requests $7,500 from NSF to support the travel and registration costs of six of the U.S. academic speakers. Additional conference support from AIChE, Washington State University, and several companies will cover printing and mailing costs, clerical support for the meeting, and two evening receptions.\r\n",
