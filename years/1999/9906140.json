 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative research agreements in industry and between industry and university partners have grown rapidly since the early 1980s, encouraged by numerous factors including the pace of competition and Federal policy.  Members of these partnerships try to exploit their complementary resources in order to create new or shared technical knowledge.  Each member wishes to profit from the relationship; so before entering it, all the members must be assured that they will be able to appropriate the results effectively.  The US National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 required the parties of a research joint venture seeking benefits from its provisions to file notifications with the Federal government.  This research will use two data bases developed with information from these filings as well as other sources to examine the ways in which intellectual property rights affect these complex arrangements.  The investigators will use surveys and interviews to collect information about the intellectual property protection mechanisms used in a large sample of US-based research joint ventures.  The surveys and interviews will cover a variety of both private sector (domestic and international) and university partners.  The major goal of the project is to understand what protection mechanisms are in use and what role they play in these ventures.  Another goal is to move towards an understanding of the relative effectiveness of one or another mechanism for a particular purpose, including the failure to form a venture or for it to reach research completion and the willingness of organizations to engage in future ventures.  Results will be useful to participants in research joint ventures and to science and technology policy makers.  They will include publications and a workshop involving diverse participants.",
