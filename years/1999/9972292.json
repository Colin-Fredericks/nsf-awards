 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes training on the professional and academic development of two Mathematical Sciences Industry-Based Graduate Research Assistants. The first objective of the training activities\r\nis to prepare the graduate students with skills and experiences that will make them strong competitors in an academic/industrial environment.  Another objective is to produce the graduate students who have qualifications that will make them important contributors to science and technology developments in an academic/industrial environment.  The proposed research focuses on computational methods and numerical analysis for modeling and design of optical micro-structures  in linear and nonlinear media, and solving inverse source problems for Maxwell's equations.  The research will extend our existing collaboration with industry and develop a new industrial collaboration. It will provide opportunities for the graduate assistants to engage in University-Industry joint research programs and make important contributions to an exciting area of applied and industrial mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe main topics of the proposed research are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Computational modeling of micro diffractive optics.\r\n\r\nContinuous developments of interface least-squares finite element methods for diffraction problems in TM polarization.  Formulation and numerical analysis for the diffraction problem by\r\nbiperiodic structures. \r\n\r\n(2) Modeling and design in nonlinear diffractive optics.\r\n\r\nWell-posedness study of a PDE model. Optimal design of nonlinear gratings.  Inverse diffraction problems.\r\nThe effect of thin coatings of nonlinear material on second harmonic generation.\r\n \r\n(3) Inverse source problems for Maxwell's equations in magnetoencephalography (MEG). \r\n\r\nDetermination of locations of epileptic foci in the living human brain.  Modeling, computation, and asymptotic analysis of the model problem.\r\n\r\nThe research has significant potential for evolving new science and providing industry with guidance to design and fabricate new optical devices and to solve the inverse source problems in electromagnetics.  This GOALI project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
