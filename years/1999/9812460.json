 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics of the University of Alabama at Birmingham is hosting an international conference on differential equations and mathematical physics during March 16-20, 1999, in Birmingham. Topics will include the analysis of multiparticle Schroedinger operators, stability of matter, relativity theory, fluid dynamics, spectral and scattering theory including inverse problems, as well as related topics. There will be ten plenary lectures given by the following leading experts: Profs. S.Y.A. Chang (Princeton), D. Christodoulou (Princeton); P. Lax (NYU), E. Lieb (Princeton), P.L. Lions (Paris), A.I. Nachman (Rochester), S.P. Novikov (Steklov Institute and University of Maryland), B. Simon (Cal Tech), J. Smoller (Michigan), J. Yngvason (Vienna). There will be 30 minute lectures organized in parallel topical special sessions of six to eight talks each (organizers in parentheses): General Relativity (G. Galloway, Miami), Integrable Systems (F. Gesztesy, Missouri), P.D.E.'s in Geometry (Y. Li, Rutgers), Quantum Mechanics (H. Siedentop, Regensburg), and Inverse Problems.  There will also be parallel sessions for up to one hundred 30-minute contributed talks.\r\n\r\nPrevious conferences with related emphases in this series were held in March of 1981, 1983, 1986, 1990, and 1994 at UAB and in March of 1992 and 1997 at the Georgia Institute of Technology. This conference series between UAB and Georgia Tech has been of great interest in the past, both here and internationally, bringing together scholars from around the world for fruitful scientific exchange in an active area in which modern mathematical analysis comes to grips with problems of scientific importance.\r\n",
