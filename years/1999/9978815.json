Lennox (University of Pittsburgh) -- \"Continental and Analytical Aspects of Logical Empiricism:   Historical and Contemporary Perspectives\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Continental and Analytical Aspects of Logical Empiricism: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives,\" an international conference being held in Florence, Italy November 2-5, 1999, will focus on the historical influences on the philosophical movement that included the Vienna Circle, Logical Positivism and Logical Empiricism. The conference will be organized by Alessandro Pagnini, Director of the Florentine Center of the History and Philosophy of Science (Centro Fiorentino di Storia e Filosofia della Scienza) and Paolo Parrini, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Florence. They are inviting historians of philosophy of science who have done research on this subject in the Archives for Scientific Philosophy of the Center for Philosophy of Science, housed at the University of Pittsburgh's Hillman Library. Understandably, the Center for Philosophy of Science was invited to collaborate in this effort.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the central organizational roles played by the Centro Fiorentino and the Pittsburgh Center, there will be participation from the Institute Vienna Circle, Vienna, Austria, and the Zentrum Philosophic und Wissenschaftstheorie, Konstanz, Germany.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy of science from the early 1920s to the mid-1950s was dominated by philosophers from Austria and Germany, a number of who were members of the Vienna Circle. The approach to philosophy of science that these philosophers originated came to be known as logical empiricism. We are now four decades away from this period of dominance, and the rise of this movement has become a central subject of historical investigation. Among the surprising results that careful historical research has turned up is the extent of the fundamental differences and disagreements that characterized the philosophers involved, and the wide variety of philosophical influences on the various members of this group. Indeed, philosophers that are currently thought of as central to diametrically opposed philosophical schools -- Continental Philosophy with its traditions of Neo-Kantianism, Phenomenology, Existentialism, Structuralism and Deconstruction and Analytic Philosophy with its emphasis on linguistic and conceptual analysis and mathematical logic -- are found both influencing, and being influenced by, Logical Empiricism.  It is these historical connections and interactions that the participants in this conference are to explore.\r\n\r\n",
