 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Utah operates a multi-user electron microscopy facility.  This facility is the primary user facility for the main University of Utah campus.  Approximately fifteen faculty from ten departments and four colleges rely on the facility for their research.  All classes of materials are examined, including polymers, ceramics, metals, and semiconductors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to serving research needs, the facility also serves educational needs.  Numerous formal courses utilize the SEM in their laboratory projects.  Additionally, graduate student training is a major objective of the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for the acquisition of a new, state-of-the-art variable pressure scanning electron microscope (SEM) to meet the current and future research needs of faculty at the University of Utah.  this equipment will provide improved and expanded capabilities over what is now available.  For example, the proposed equipment has light element x-ray detection capabilities, and will obtain x-ray maps.  The variable pressure (or low vacuum) feature is especially useful in this laboratory, as non-conducting samples such as polymers and ceramics can be examined without application of a conducting coating.  This ensures that no features of the material will be masked.  Furthermore, compositional analysis will be more reliable without a coating, as the coating can crate peak overlap and/or absorb low energy x-rays.\r\n\r\nThe educational benefits of this equipment include student use of state-of-the-art instrumentation.  Numerous formal courses will utilize the SE in their laboratory projects.  G\r\nGraduates will enter the work force better prepared to analyze materials and to solve problems.  An additional aspect of this project is the development of a web-accessible laboratory, providing remote students with access to high priced technological equipment.  This work will be conducted in collaboration with an NSF-funded project at the Iowa State University.\r\n***\r\nThis equipment provides a unique opportunity for students and faculty to enhance collaborative research and educational activities in a significant manner.\r\n",
