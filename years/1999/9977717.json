The PI's propose to design and develop a manipulation system that will be conceived from the start to satisfy the requirements and needs for operating in human environments.  This human-centered manipulation system will be a two-arm structure connected to a common torso mounted on a mobile platform. Each arm will be a redundant mechanism with seven degrees of freedom. The arms will be lightweight structures, with low effective mass and inertia, and will use energy absorbing surfaces.  The actuation of joints will be based on a novel and compact arrangement that uses  three motors for two degrees of freedom joint mechanization.  This yields a modular pitch-roll kinematics for the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. The requirements for the integration of two arms with the self-contained platform is also an important aspect in this design. Reliability, low cost, clean and quite operations will also be among the characteristics addressed in this project.   \r\n",
