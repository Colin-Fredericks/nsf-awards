Main objectives are as follows: (i) For the case of classical direct statistical settings, like density estimation or heteroscedastic regression, create the theory and methods of finding minimal sample sizes (the degree of the problem) where asymptotically sharp data-driven estimates outperform any other estimates. (ii) For indirect statistical problems, such as nonparametric survival analysis, blurred images or regression\r\nwith measurement errors in predictors, create the theory of equivalence between these settings and the corresponding direct ones with a particular emphasis on finding the relation between sample sizes needed for a similar quality of estimation. (iii) For nonparametric curve estimation problems involving time series with heavy tails and long range dependence, which frequently arise in the modern communication systems like the World Wide Web, develop optimal data-driven procedures of nonparametric estimation. \r\n\r\nStatistical theory is primarily interested in finding most accurate procedures for large samples while in practically interesting cases sample sizes may be both large and small.  Moreover, the notion of a large or small sample depends on an underlying setting.  The research is devoted to developing universal procedures, which are simultaneously optimal for both large and small sample sizes.  The developed methods will be tested on the following specific practical problems which motivated this proposal: (1) Insulin secretion by the type II diabetes patients; (2) The geomagnetic polarity time-scale and the speed of seafloor spreading using marine magnetic observations, and how these factors affect environment and global change; (3) Drinking water quality including monitoring arsenic and other cancer-causing substances in New Mexico; (4) Learning machines for screening patients in emergency rooms; (5) Engineered systems for the analysis of transformed and noisy images. These applied problems will be done together with Sandia National Laboratories, the UNM Medical Center and Maui High Performance Computing Center.  \r\n",
