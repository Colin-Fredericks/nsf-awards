In Part I, Heinonen outlines a program for\r\na study of geometric branched covers between generalized manifolds. This\r\nis a joint project with Seppo Rickman. The motivation to build such a\r\ntheory comes from the attempts to understand what metric spaces admit\r\n(possibly branched) Lipschitz or quasisymmetric parametrizations in\r\nEuclidean space. In Part II, Heinonen explains how branched covers and the\r\nrecent advances in analysis on metric spaces could be used to approach the\r\n parametrization problem. In different terminology, Heinonen proposes to\r\ncharacterize locally Euclidean metric gauge by using the theory of\r\nquasiregular maps. This is a joint project with Dennis Sullivan. In Part\r\nIII, Heinonen discusses the problem of the branch set of a quasiregular\r\nmap. Analytic conditions are searched that would imply a given\r\nquasiregular map is a local homeomorphism. This problem is relevant to\r\nPart II, and to problems in nonlinear elasticity where deformation of\r\nbodies are investigated.  Part III is a joint project with Tero\r\nKilpel\"ainen. \r\n\r\nThe proposal continues the PI's earlier investigations, where discrete\r\nmethods in analysis and geometry are being searched that would serve in\r\nspaces that are not smooth in the classical sense.  Here the word\r\n``analysis'' means the branch of mathematics that developed out of the\r\nCalculus; it is the study of continuous changes in infinitesimal data,\r\nfrom which one wants to predict global conclusions.  ``Geometry'' is the\r\nstudy of space, its many forms and varieties, in many possible dimensions.\r\nDiscrete methods mean the opposite to continuous, or calculus methods, and\r\ninvolve more finite, ``counting'' ideas, such as those done by a computer,\r\nalbeit in this work still of analytic and geometric flavor. The concept of\r\nquasiconformality enters the discussion in the most subtle way:  it allows\r\nthe space and its formation to be singular (for instance, with kinks or roughness) at times and in places, but not everywhere and not all the time. There is a certain control in the distortion, which perhaps looked artificial to the mathematicians 40 years ago when the first research in the field was conducted. Now quasiconformality is a ubiquitous phenomenon in mathematics.  From the work of Dennis Sullivan in the late seventies we know that every space\r\nthat locally looks like a flat space of Euclid has a quasiconformal\r\nstructure albeit not a smooth structure in general; and this is true in\r\nevery dimension but four. Nevertheless, also in dimension four, there are\r\nconjecturally an infinity of spaces where one cannot do ordinary, smooth\r\nanalysis, or calculus, but where one can do quasiconformal, nonsmooth\r\nanalysis. The proposal addresses both the need to have a better\r\nunderstanding of this new calculus in nonsmooth spaces and methods how to\r\nrecognize spaces that are quasiconformally Euclidean. Although the main\r\nquestions in the proposal are motivated by a basic quest for understanding\r\nthe structure of space, the consequent study of singularities in\r\ntransformations has had applications to material sciences, where one wants\r\nto know when a deformed body collapses onto itself under a strain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
