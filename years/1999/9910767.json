Stephenson\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWith NSF funding, this proposal seeks to create an influential workshop focused on ways to enhance learning for adults via online education. The two-day workshop will bring together developers from the university and corporate worlds who are pioneers in building interactive,  Internet-based courses or course materials for adults in educational and corporate settings. Its goal is to move the field forward and bring its focus back to effective teaching and learning. The developers of online classes are the workshop's target audience, and the issues considered will be those with the greatest impact on educational effectiveness and of greatest concern to such developers. Specifically, the topics examined will be:\r\nn conveying concepts and understanding through active learning\r\nn concept-based navigation\r\nn testing understanding online\r\nn ways to get learners collaborating online\r\nn providing elements of a laboratory experience online\r\nn assessing what determines educational effectiveness and how it is measured\r\nn novel ways to build interactive, effective, online educational content.\r\n\r\nA number of different, innovative approaches to each topic will be presented, evaluated and compared from the point of view of educational effectiveness and practicality. The goal is to identify the best, leading-edge techniques for effective internet-based teaching and promote them so as to advance the state of the art. The results of the workshop will be widely disseminated, both as a book, and via the Web (via asynchronous streaming video broadcast of the proceedings) which will be widely publicized. \r\n\r\n",
