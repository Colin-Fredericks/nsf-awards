The investigation has applications in a number of areas such as System Modeling/Understanding, Verification and Validation, Predictive Engineering, and Potential Advances in Diagnosis and Treatment of Visually Impaired. Because of the number of different areas of application, there is a potential for bringing together researchers in computer science,\r\nelectrical engineering, and Optometry\r\n(for biomedical applications).\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluded in this study are the differences among various visualization techniques such as 3D Image Interpolation, 3D Image Extrapolation, and 3D Model Reconstruction & Rendering. The results of this research are used to determine the limitations in the various techniques as well as investigate novel applications where these technologies will provide further understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
