The\r\ninvestigator and his colleagues have developed two general\r\ntheories: one based around radiative transport for elastic wave\r\npropagation in the crustal waveguide, and the other based on\r\nwaves in nearly layered random media.  The mathematical issues\r\ninvolved in radiative transfer are (i) the derivation of boundary\r\nconditions (ii) the introduction and use of good Monte Carlo\r\nmethods (iii) the solution of realistic inverse problems for\r\nparameter identification.  In the case of nearly layered media an\r\nimportant mathematical issue is the robustness of wave\r\nlocalization, known to hold for perfectly layered random media.\r\nAnother direction of study is the assessment of the effect of\r\nrandom inhomogeneities on time reversal imaging, called wave\r\nmigration in geophysics.  The mathematical analysis requires time\r\ndomain statistics for time reversed pulses, which have to be\r\nconstructed by Fourier analysis.  Theoretical explanations are\r\nprovided for the increased resolution in time reversal imaging\r\ndue to the inhomogeneities.\r\n     Geophysical wave propagation, the propagation of seismic\r\nwaves in the earth's crust for example, requires mathematical\r\nmodeling at several levels depending on the accuracy and the\r\nresolution required.  It is impossible to simulate numerically\r\nseismic wave propagation over a few hundreds of kilometers of the\r\nearth's crust while taking into account the detailed\r\ninhomogeneities in the earth's crust.  Radiative transport theory\r\ncan be used very effectively and at much lower computational\r\ncost, and it can provide estimates for the codas (tails) of\r\nseismograms with enough accuracy to interpret and analyze many\r\ncontinental seismic events.  The project provides the mathematical\r\nmethodology and infrastructure for using radiative transport in\r\ngeophysical problems.  The investigator looks carefully at what is\r\nneeded to deal with discontinuities and interfaces in the crustal\r\nenvironment, what is needed for large scale imaging from surface\r\nseismic measurements, what is needed for assessing the waveguide\r\neffects that appear in long distance seismic wave propagation,\r\nand what is needed for the effective numerical simulation of long\r\ndistance seismic wave propagation.\r\n\r\n",
