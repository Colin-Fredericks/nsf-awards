 "awd_abstract_narration": "DEB 9903650\r\nWard\r\nUniv. California\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with improving our knowledge and understanding of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a group of insects that is ecologically important, and rich in behavioral and biological diversity.  The focus of this project is on ant systematics and classification, i.e., the discovery and description of new species, the provision of identification keys, and the elucidation of the phylogenetic relationships among species.  This is achieved through a combination of fieldwork, morphological study, and analysis of molecular data (DNA sequences).  Most of the research is targeted on the ant genus Pseudomyrmex, which is a large and successful group in the New World tropics.  Many of these ant species have developed mutually beneficial associations with specialized tropical trees: the plants provide nesting sites for the ants, and in return the ants protect their host plant from herbivores by patrolling the plant and stinging intruders.  The sting gland venom of one species, Pseudomyrmex triplarinus, has proved efficacious in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\r\n\r\nAn improved classification of these ants will help us to understand important features about their biology.  For example, in the realm of ant/plant mutualisms, we can address such questions as:  How many times have ants evolved close associations with plants? What factors predispose the development of such relationships?  What are the special characteristics of plant-protecting ants, and can these qualities be exploited for the protection of plants valuable to man?  With respect to the possible use of these ants for treatment of medical ailments, a reliable taxonomy and phylogeny allows more accurate prediction about which species to target for investigation.  Finally, an improved taxonomy of these ants permits them to be used, along with other organisms such as birds and butterflies, as \"indicator taxa\" that provide information about the health of the environment.  Many of these ant species occur only in tropical rainforests.  Loss of ant species diversity will go undetected unless we can actually identify and recognize the individual species.\r\n\r\n",
