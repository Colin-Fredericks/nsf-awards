Planar algebras are best defined as algebras over the planar operad-the operad consisting of isotopy classes of planar tangles which are collections of disjoint discs inside a large disc connected up by smooth curves called strings. It is a remarkable theorem of Popa and myself that, together with suitable positivity conditions, a planar algebra is equivalent to a subfactor of finite index of a Murray-von Neumann type II_1 factor on a separable Hilbert space. The proof has analytic, algebraic and topological aspects and needs to be better understood but it is the wealth of examples and potential new examples that is the current reason for excitement. The quanum invariants of links and three manifolds admit a unified treatment as does the duality which allows one to locate critical points in various statistical mechanical models starting with the Ising model. The van Kampen diagrams of the theory of finitely generated come naturally from planar algebra considerations and Connes' cyclic category can be defined very simply as certain annular tangles. Bisch and myself discovered an entirely new kind of planar algebra called the Fuss-Catalan algebra by exploiting the connection with subfactors. This algebra has been used to construct a \"new\" solvable model in statistical mechanics. New algebras using variations of this method are just around the corner.\r\n\r\n  The aim of this research project is to develop and exploit connections between various branches of science related to objects called \"planar algebras\". A planar algebra is a mathematical structure based on diagrams reminiscent of electronic circuits. There are inputs and outputs all connected with a system of wires that are not allowed to cross and so could be engraved on a surface.  Models of statistical mechanics in two dimensions give examples of planar algebras and vice versa. Knots in three dimensional space can be projected onto the plane and the resulting picture consists of crossings - the inputs-tied together by non crossing strings. One obtains as output the theory of polynomial invariants of knots which have been used by molecular biologists in the study of DNA molecules. Indeed the planar diagrams resemble some of the models used to study DNA recombination. It is quite extraordinary that these planar algebras are, under the assumption of what physicists call \"reflection positivity\", equivalent to a theory of certain von Neumann algebras which themselves are collections of operators in Hilbert space devised by von Neumann to be used in quantum mechanics.\r\n",
