The fracture of all types of materials is a catastrophic phenomenon with considerable technological and scientific importance.  A vigorous investigation will be initiated of a statistical physics framework and of physically motivated models that will be correlated with experimental data in order ro obtain accurate assessments of the rupture point and identification of potential precursors.  This research applies in particular to fiber composites, rocks, concrete under compression and materials with large distributed residual stresses.  The research will address two main issues: (1) What is the nature of rupture as a function of heterogeneity, load sharing rules and relaxation processes? (2) What are the characteristics of precursors when they are present?  Starting with the discovery that the rupture process can be abrupt or critical depending on the amount of disorder, we will investigate whether this phenomenon is robust in other systems, what is its degree of \"universality,\" and how it can be used practically.  We propose two complementary approaches: (1) a numerical modeling effort, using a thermal fuse model and a tensorial extension, as well as a block-spring model, will test how the rupture depends on different material properties and on the microscopic scale structures.  In particular, we will explore how much \"disorder\" is \"strong\" disorder and when collective effects dominate over the \"one crack\" problem.  (2) a methodological and data analysis effort will focus on the conditions of application of the theory of time-to-failure that has been developed based on the detection of characteristic scales.  This will be investigated in the context of the two numerical models and on experimental data available from collaborating experimental groups.  We will extend this theory in three ways: by using a novel non-perturbative resummation technique that will allow us to extend the interval of fit; by using a log-periodic wavelet that provides an optimal (time-to-failure)-scale decomposition of log-periodic precursory patterns; and, by using stochastic Langevin equations of rupture to analyze the distribution of lifetimes within a class of exactly solvavble models.\r\n  \r\nThis award supports theoretical research on modeling and predicting rupture in composite materials.
