 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with several aspects of the theory of \r\nweak solutions for hyperbolic systems, with the objective to develop\r\ntechniques for understanding the emergence of shock waves from \r\nsmooth approximate solutions in the small viscosity and small \r\nrelaxation-time limits.  Such questions are intimately tied to the \r\nmechanical issue of the passage from one thermomechanical theory \r\nto another, and appear in models of continuum physics, kinetic theory,  \r\nand in the interface of the two. The goal is on the one hand to exploit \r\nideas from the kinetic theory of gases in developing theory for hyperbolic \r\nsystems, on the other hand in applying recent advances from the theory \r\nof hyperbolic equations in studying the passage from microscopic theories \r\n(of interacting particles) to mesoscopic theories (at the kinetic level) \r\nto macroscopic (continuum) theories. \r\n\r\nShock waves are coherent structures that appear in situations involving \r\nhigh speed supersonic flows. Their mathematical modeling involves \r\nnonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations. Understanding the \r\ntheory of these equations is very important in the design and implementation \r\nof numerical algorithms for computing.  The emphasis of this proposal is \r\nin situations involving shock waves in transitions from rarefied to dense \r\ngases.  A  typical application is air flow in high altitude supersonic flight,\r\nfor example during reentry of a space shuttle into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n",
