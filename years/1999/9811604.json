 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe primary mission of the FSU Marine Laboratory is to support and foster, research and training programs\r\nin the coastal sciences.  The laboratory is known for providing high quality seawater for experimental work\r\nand easy access to a variety of coastal habitats.  The laboratory is utilized by FSU faculty, staff, and students\r\nfrom several campus-based departments, especially the Departments of Biological Sciences and Oceanography, as well as visitors from other universities and organizations.  The laboratory supports research, student training, and public outreach programs.  All of these programs involve the laboratory maintenance and/or manipulation of marine organisms and each requires seawater.  The present seawater intake system is located in shallow water.  Because of this location the laboratory is subject to frequent disruptions in service owing to damage to the pipe and intake by fisherman and storms.  During\r\nextreme low tides the intake manifold lies exposed and resuspended sediments arising from turbulence cause damage to the pumps.  These problems limit service and make the system extremely costly to maintain.  This project will allow the relocation of intake manifold to deeper water and the relocation and burial of the intake lines.  Completion of this project will insure that the laboratory is able to continue to provide the high quality seawater that is needed for the many research and training activities that take place at the laboratory.",
