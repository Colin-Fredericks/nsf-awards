 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in development of a real-time sensor for monitoring the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration in the reformate feed to a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell used to power an electric vehicle.  Monitoring of the CO concentration is required to prevent performance degradation of the fuel cell.  The Phase II program will extend the CO in reformate measurement technique, demonstrated in Phase I, to a miniature, low-cost, rugged sensor suitable for electric vehicles.  The unique approach for electrochemical detection of CO consists of adsorption of CO on the working electrode, electrochemical consumption of the bulk hydrogen (H2), and a subsequent voltammetric sweep to oxidize the CO adsorbed on the electrode surface.  The CO oxidation current is proportional to the CO concentration in the reformate sample.  The major focus of this program will be to develop a miniaturized sensor cell and an improved electrochemical H2 consumption process to reduce the response time.  The program goal will be to demonstrate detection of CO levels of 1ppm to greater than 1000 ppm with a response time of 10 seconds and an ultimate goal of 1 second time. The program will culminate in the fabrication and demonstration of a low volume, fast response sensor for detection of CO in a reformate.                               \r\n     The primary application will be fuel-cell-powered electric vehicles, which have the potential for a very large market considering the requirements for low-emission vehicles.  Other applications include fuel cells for stationary power production.\r\n",
