 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a program of radar studies of internal stratigraphy and bedrock topography along the traverses for the U.S. component of the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (US ITASE).  The radar will provide information immediately available in the field on ice thickness and internal layer structure to help in the selection of core sites as the traverse proceeds.  These data will also be useful in siting deeper millennial scale cores planned at less frequent intervals along the traverse, and in the selection of the location for the deep inland core planned for the future.  In addition to continuous coverage along the traverse route, more detailed studies on a grid surrounding each of the core locations will be made to better characterize accumulation and bedrock topography in each area.  This proposal is complimentary to the one submitted by the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL), which proposes a high frequency radar to examine the shallower portion of the record down to approximately 60 meters, including the presence of near-surface crevasses.   The radar proposed herein is most sensitive at depths below 60 meters and can depict deep bedrock and internal layers to a substantial fraction of the ice thickness.\r\n\r\n",
