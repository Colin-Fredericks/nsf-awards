 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861308\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and pilot test low cost educational modules for teaching science in several elementary grades Q through 6). Very recent advances in the photonics industry have produced a variety of miniature light sources called lightemitting diodes (LEDs) that cover the visible spectrum (red, green, blue). We will develop small, hand held light sources based on these devices and we will also develop miniature light detectors. These kits will include the necessary hardware as well as extensive curriculum materials for teachers and students. Specific science experiments will include: reflection, refraction, color theory, scattering, and fluorescence. Technology applications will include: simple models of bar code readers, CD players, and communication by light. Working closely with a curriculum director and teachers, we will integrate the kits into an existing science curriculum at several elementary and middle schools, and extensive pilot testing will be completed.\r\n     There is considerable commercial potential for the low cost, versatile kits that we propose. Kits that offer exciting and inquiry based classroom experiments to elementary and middle school students could be widely accepted if the selling price is low. Our units will be centered around very low cost devices, yet will be effective and reliable.\r\n",
