 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subjective value of information in high-stakes domains:         \r\nAn analysis of patient decisions to obtain diagnostic testing\r\n\r\nIn recent years, there has been a tremendous proliferation of both at-home and in-hospital medical screening tests. Health care trends in the United States are causing individuals to be more responsible for making their own decisions regarding whether to be tested. The proposed experimental and survey research tests a model for describing how patients are likely to make these decisions. Such an understanding of patient behavior should have important public policy implications; for instance, identification of any biases that could result in poorer decision-making should allow for the development of interventions to help patients make better decisions.\r\nIn many of these testing situations, the cost of not discovering the ailment is greater than over-prescribing the treatment or further testing; thus the tests are typically designed to err on the side of  \"false alarms\" rather than \"false negatives.\"  This is especially true in medical screening tests, where there is a general prevalence of false positive results. For instance, breast cancer screening typically results in very high false positive rates, particularly for women under 50 who have a low base rate for breast cancer. Approximately 15% to 20% of screening mammograms are positive results requiring some follow-up, but only a small (2% - 6%) percentage of these positive results are true positives reflecting the presence of breast cancer. Putting these data into cumulative terms, a recent study estimated the cumulative risk of a false positive result after 10 mammograms as 49.1% with 18.6% of women without breast cancer expected to undergo one surgical biopsy for every 10 mammograms.  A major focus of our work is to examine how false positive results from past testing may affect patients' decisions to be tested in the future. \r\nOur approach is to combine theory from social psychology with formal \"value of information\" models that consider probabilities and utility formulations.  We believe that due to this high-stress nature of these types of decisions that patients will systematically deviate from normative behavior. Initial results indicate that false positive events might increase later test compliance through increased perceived vulnerability.  We propose to dig deeper into the causes of this result and try to determine the cognitive and emotional processes (i.e., feelings about guilt or blame) that are operating. We are particularly interested in identifying factors that are normatively irrelevant to one's actual likelihood of getting the disease, but that may influence diagnostic testing decisions through perceptions of vulnerability.  \r\n\r\nWe propose a three-pronged research approach. First, we validate our experimental procedures on undergraduate student subject populations.  Second, the core of our research program asks adult women to respond to experimental tasks in relevant medical contexts, such as mammogram waiting rooms or family-planning clinics. Finally, we will use survey methodology sent to convenience samples of the appropriate population (e.g., women over 40 years of age for mammography-related research) to validate our experimental findings. \r\n\r\n\r\n\t \r\n",
