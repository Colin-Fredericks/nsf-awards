 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student achievement in our introductory chemistry courses remains unsatisfactory, and transfer of knowledge from the introductory courses to subsequent courses in chemistry and biology is also a concern. In order to increase student learning of introductory chemistry, and thus first time success, we are implementing a student-active learning environment that promotes conceptual understanding and critical thinking and supports a variety of learning styles. This is being accomplished by adapting/adopting the curriculum materials, approaches, information management, and computer tools developed in the New Traditions Project (NT). The ConcepTests, Challenge Problems and guided-inquiry laboratories of NT are being used. These are being supplemented, and new ones with a biological emphasis are being developed. The varied student populations in all our introductory chemistry courses (\"majors,\" \"allied health,\" and general education) are being served. The student-centered environment and emphasis on effective teaching is expected to enhance the attractiveness of chemistry to underrepresented groups and to education majors.  Faculty from Morgan State University and Coppin State College are joining in these efforts.\r\n\r\nA guided inquiry laboratory manual is being developed for use in all introductory courses. Parts or options within the same experiment are being used to meet the laboratory goals of specific courses. Professional development activities focus on preparing faculty from the University, area community colleges and urban colleges and universities to implement the adapted/adopted NT curriculum. A peer assistant program is being developed to increase the efficiency of student learning. The assessment of student achievement in our new program is expected to provide valuable data concerning the effectiveness of NT with a variety of students and in a range of introductory courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
