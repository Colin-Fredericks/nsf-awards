 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860999\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will contribute mathematical services in signal and image processing to the distributed Java computing space. A major component of internetworked information is digital images and audio signals. Current vector, signal, and image processing standards are evaluated to achieve advanced signal processing for Java. Vector signal and image processing (VSIP) constitutes a viable option for commercialization in the distributed Java environment. This effort seeks to make the connection from the theoretical to the commercial for VSIP in Java, while identifying operational modes and service requirements for this non-traditional programming environment. If successful, a large community of Java programmers in academic, industry, and government could be enabled, as well as the service recipients. \r\n     Standardization for platform independence is a critical issue for Internet applications. An advanced commercially DSP tool-kit would provide for a greater level of portability for signal-processing-intensive Internet applications. This would provide for better support for processing audio/visual information in valuable application settings. Embedded Java applications will make use of the tool-kit to provide advanced signal analysis capabilities with mobility, portability, and high quality.\r\n",
