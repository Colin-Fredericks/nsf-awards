 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two kinds of analysis have recently been prominent in the academic literature on environmental justice. First, numerous empirical efforts have examined the relationship between the location of environmental hazards and socially vulnerable populations. These quantitative studies continue to produce contradictory and contentious findings on environmental equity, due in large part to different definitions of the appropriate scale of analysis.  A second group of studies have focused on the development of hazard ranking indices to evaluate and compare the potential risks of chemical releases. These efforts have produced a variety of techniques to develop toxicity weighting algorithms. These current efforts have raised interesting questions, but are limited because: (1) they have not paid proper attention to issues of spatial scale, (2) they have mostly looked at singular hazards and not at risk indices, and (3) they have not properly considered multiple indicators of social vulnerability such as race/ethnicity, age, education, rurality, income, and unemployment. Working with the Risk-Screening Indicator Model in the EPA Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, this project will introduce methodological innovations that bridge these lines of environmental justice research. In particular, the methods will help develop an empirical tool that combines both spatial and hazard screening techniques. The primary hypothesis is that scale issues have a major impact on environmental equity analysis and play a large part in confounding results across different studies. Spatial scale and issues of aggregation have not been the focus of much critical examination in the academic literature on environmental equity. The proposed project will address the following questions. How does change in scale affect the analysis and outcomes of correlation between environmental hazard locations and socioeconomic variables? Are spatial clusters of environmental hazards and community socioeconomic variables evident in metropolitan areas? Can a hierarchy of metropolitan hazards be discerned across the metropolitan riskscape? By combining spatial and hazard screening tools, decision-makers and citizens can begin to determine clusters of varying hazards that may be impacting socially vulnerable populations. These techniques can move analysts towards methods to identify high environmental impact areas for further pollution prevention efforts or more focused risk assessments.",
