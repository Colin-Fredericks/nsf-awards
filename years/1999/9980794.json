The project is based on the development of novel devices consisting of a nanocomposite MOSFETstructure integrated with arrays of block copolymer oriented cylindrical (hexagonal) ZnO nanocrystalline structures of varying dimensions and spacing emulating the cochlea of the ear, and a nanocomposite light emitting Si/ZnO diode for UV surface light emission.  The sensing imaging capability of the proposed device and chip technology, is based on the enhanced piezoelectric properties of nanoconfined ZnO and its successful interfacing with the mature and well developed Si CMOS technology, while the UV light emission is based on the enhanced nanocavity emission of the ZnO nanocrystalline structures.\r\n\r\nFor the development of such technology they propose:\r\n\r\nThe development of the diblock copolymer with self-assembled ZnO nanocrystalline structures.\r\n\r\nThe development of processing technology compatible with that of Si and the copolymer chemistry, for the successful integration of the nanocrystalline structures in the devices.\r\n\r\nThe \"proof of concept\" development of the novel nanocomposite MOSFETsound wave imaging sensor device, and the novel nanocomposite UV-light emitting diode.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of this investigation they expect to substantially enhance their knowledge in the:\r\n\r\nPiezoelectric, electrical, and optical properties of nanoconfined crystalline structures, with and                 without the polymer matrix.\r\n\r\nThe processing of copolymer nanocrystalline structures on\tSi, and the properties of composite Si                 devices.\r\n***",
