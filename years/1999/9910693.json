Detailed investigations of short oligonucleotide with known sequence of bases, and different length of chain, and of more complex DNA molecules will be performed using techniques based upon Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The emphasis will be made on receiving reliable, quantitative experimental results.\r\nIn our previous experimental studies, resonant modes have been observed in this very far infrared region, where specific features in spectra of different DNA objects are expected to be found. The goal of this project is to demonstrate experimentally the use of submillimeter wave spectra in the differentiation of specific DNAs.\r\nThe experimental study of vibrational spectra of DNA polymers in the subroillimiter wave range will confirm the fundamental character of the resonant spectra and will demonstrate the feasibility of long-wavelength vibration spectroscopy as an approach for identification of DNA signatures. In the long term perspective, these results create a scientific basis for the development and demonstration of revolutionary submillimeter wave bio-sensing technology.\r\n\r\nIntroduction- The Significance of the Proposed Activity\r\n\r\nThe development of new techniques for the detection and identification of bio warfare agents is a very important and challenging scientific problem at this time. Previous studies have indicated that spectroscopic characterization of biological RNA and DNA polymer chains in the very far-infrared (IR) region reflects low-frequency molecular internal motions and can give information regarding three-dimensional structure and flexibility of DNA double helix. In the submillimeter-wave frequency range ( 3 400 cm-1), vibrations of macromolecules involve rigidly bound subgroups which are connected by the weakest bonds and/or non-bonded interactions, and vibrations that stretch the bridging hydrogen bonds between the two strands [1]. Theoretical results have indicated that DNA low-frequency deformations are extremely sensitive to its nucleotide composition and three-dimensional structure, have an impact on the main processes related to transferring of genetical information, such as replication, transcription and viral infection [2], and should reflect features specific to the DNA code. Thus, phonon modes that arise in this range can serve as a signature of specific DNA-molecules. This new fundamental mechanism for bio identification, if confirmed, has to be used to demonstrate that a large number of species-specific phonon modes may be detected relatively easily from semi-dry films made from randomly oriented DNA fibers.\r\n\r\nObjectives of the proposed work.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the proposed work is to perform submillimeter wave spectroscopic research on DNA macromolecules including short-chained oligonucleotides of known base-pair sequences to demonstrate the utility of submillimeter waves for obtaining a unique, DNA signatures characteristic of moderate to short range order in the macromolecules.\r\n\r\nProject description\r\n\r\nOur initial work have demonstrated that interatomic interactions produce hundreds of low-frequency vibrations in the far-IR region. Such interactions are extremely sensitive to DNA structure and topology. We have also demonstrated that IR absorption produced by different modes can differ many folds. As a result, the analysis of DNA low-frequency vibrations has a potential to become a clue to DNA structure and topology. The next step is to perform an experimental study which will demonstrate uniqueness of low frequency characteristic of macromolecule fragments depending on the length, structure and topology.\r\n",
