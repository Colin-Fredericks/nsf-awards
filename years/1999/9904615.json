 "awd_abstract_narration": "The current application stems from an effort to isolate genes of Dictyostelium that participate in the determination of cell type and the regulation of cell proportion.  To accomplish this, Dr. Ennis has taken advantage of the genetic tools available in this organism and its aggregative life style.  The selection he employed was the result of a reconsideration of the evolution of this organism and is based on the idea that mutant ameobae can enter an aggregate and compete to form a live spore rather than a dead stalk cell.  He performed a large mutagenesis and selected a mutant, which he calls cheater A (ctrA), which makes only spores when in a chimera.  The frequency of ctrA mutants increases gradually in the population during several cycles of growth and development.  In chimeras with wild-type, the ctrA mutant cells always from spores and infrequently form stalk.  The mutant appears to suppress the spore forming ability of isogenic parental strains.  The ctrA gene has been isolated and characterized.  It codes for a developmentally regulated mRNA and contains several WD repeats, indicating a potential role in protein-protein interaction.  A number of suppressor mutants have been isolated and the genes for these are being characterized in order to determine the pathway within which CtrA operates.  Selections for other counter-suppressor mutants are proposed and a model to account for the non-autonomous behavior of the ctrA mutant will be presented.  Dr. Ennis proposes that ctrA is a gene with an important role in cell-cell communication and regulation and presents a series of experiments to determine how development is regulated.",
