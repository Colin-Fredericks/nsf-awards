 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the work outlined in this proposal is to gain a better\r\nunderstanding of R. meliloti growth and gene expression throughout the\r\nsteps of infection and invasion of alfalfa, its host plant.  This\r\ninvestigator describes experiments that will test  the dynamics and\r\nbehavior of R. meliloti during growth inside of infection threads.  This\r\nwill be done by following Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-tagged, mixed\r\nwith non-GFP-tagged R. meliloti, as they grow together inside infection\r\nthreads.  A working model of bacterial growth during invasion will be used\r\nto guide and help interpret these experiments.  Other experiments include\r\nthe isolation and characterization of genes from R. meliloti that are\r\ninduced when this bacterium is growing inside infection threads.  A\r\nfluorescence-activated-cell-sorter (FACS) will be used to rapidly and\r\nefficiently isolate R. meliloti gene fusions which are upregulated when R.\r\nmeliloti is growing inside of infection threads.  Upregulated bacterial\r\ngenes will be sequenced and then characterized by determining their spatial\r\nand temporal patterns of expression.  In addition, the induced genes will\r\nbe mutated in order to determine their functional roles during bacterial\r\ngrowth inside infection threads.\r\n\r\nMuch research has gone into developing strains of Rhizobium which lead to\r\nincreased plant yield.  Often these bacterial strains behave as anticipated\r\nunder controlled conditions, but fail to live up to their potential in\r\nfield trials.  This often occurs because the engineered Rhizobium strains\r\ncannot compete effectively for access to infection sites with native\r\nRhizobia present in the soil.  To compete effectively, Rhizobial strains\r\nmust be able to recognize host plant roots, and trigger the production of\r\ninfection sites and then populate those sites.  One practical aspect of the\r\nwork proposed in this application is that it may eventually lead to\r\nadvances that will enable the design of engineered Rhizobium strains which\r\ncan better compete with native bacteria for access\r\nto host plants in agricultural settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
