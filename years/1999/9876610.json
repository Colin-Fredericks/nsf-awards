Potential applications of CXD as a probe of static structure on a very fine length scale will be pursued first.  The experiments will use the undulator radiation from the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at the Argonne National Laboratory.  The time dependent counterpart of CXD, called X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) will be applied to the study of growth at surfaces of Si and Ge by molecular-beam and chemical-vapor deposition methods in order to understand how growth instabilities arise that lead to defects in the grown material.  The overall goals of the work are to advance the understanding of the coherent diffraction process by measuring static speckle from simple two dimensional systems, such as domain structures PMN and GeSi. A long term goal  is the investigation of thermal fluctuations of surfaces in equilibrium with the XPCS method in order to obtain a better quantitative understanding of the general thermodynamic principles that govern the behavior of surfaces.  \r\n%%% \r\nA recently invented method called Coherent X-ray Diffraction was  found to have important applications to the study of surfaces and interfaces.  The method is very sensitive to the roughness of silicon wafers on an extremely fine scale.  A new mathematical method was developed to yield from the experimental data the image of the surface topography, or of a buried interface, with a resolution over a useful length scale.  This imaging method may supercede the current practice of imaging the surface topography by scanning stylus methods.  The exploratory research will be performed on the Advanced Light Source of the Argonne National Laboratory and will establish a new benchmark for the sensitivity for surface studies.  In addition to improving the understanding of the coherent X-ray diffraction method itself, the results of this research will have important bearings on the future technology of semiconductors and nano-structures.  This research will provide training to graduate students and postdoctoral research associates in an area of technology which will be of great importance during the next several decades of the 21st Century.\r\n***\r\n",
