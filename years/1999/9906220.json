The two investigators plan to conduct research to 1) study high performance photodetectors operating at 1.55 micrometer wavelength with bandwidth-efficiency (BWE) products approaching 100 GHz.  2) design, fabricate and characterize these photodetectors.   The proposed detectors are top-illuminated photodiodes with optical design based on resonant cavity enhanced (RCE) detection scheme.  The final product of this research will be a major improvement in the bandwidth efficiency performance of photodetectors, which will have applications in long-haul optical communication systems. \r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow collaboration between Turkish and US scientists who have complementary capabilities and experience.  The planned collaboration will support the Boston University research initiative to expand scientific knowledge and experience in photodetectors, and to produce a new family of photodetectors whose performance is enhanced by placing the active device structure inside a Fabry-Perot resonant microcavity.  The RCE detection scheme can be used in many detector designs to improve the device sensitivity and speed.  Two graduate students at Boston University will participate in this collaborative project.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit. \r\n",
