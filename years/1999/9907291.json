 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several divisions and programs within the National Science Foundation's Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) are collaborating to convene a conference for Principal Investigators conducting research on or involved with projects in teacher preparation.  The National Center for Improving Science Education (NCISE) is providing skillful support for the conference, including site selection, advance registration, exhibitor arrangements, and production of a proceedings document.  The workshop's purposes are to:  (1) permit participants to exchange research and best practices to increase the effectiveness of their currently funded work; and (2) influence participants to make their current and future research and projects address the nation's pressing needs in teacher preparation.\r\n\r\nBecause NCISE has its own research experience with the substance of the proposed conference, it can ensure that the mechanics of the conference are designed to best fulfill its substantive goals.  NCISE staff is performing the following main functions:\r\n\r\n     helping to design the macro-agenda for the conference, and helping NSF program officers decide all of the major agenda elements.\r\n\r\n     finding and negotiating with an appropriate conference site with the needed facilities and services and negotiating the best possible contract.\r\n\r\n     leading design of the micro-agenda, and being responsible for recommending exact timing of all events, their operation, their space assignment and other matters pertaining to the conference.\r\n\r\n     registering all participants, including receiving and processing all participant applications, including confirming registration.
