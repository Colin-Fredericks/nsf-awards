These microscopic alterations may be probed optically for spectroscopic signatures of pre-disease, potentially leading to non-invasive diagnosis in vivo.  Because these optical techniques do not require the removal of tissue, they represent a tremendous advance over the current invasive practice of tissue biopsy.  When tissue biopsy is required to confirm disease staging, these optical techniques may be employed as an adjunct to conventional biopsy, by providing real-time guidance to the physician during clinical procedures.  Once diagnosed, pre-diseased tissue may be treated, effectively ridding the body of the risk of developing potentially deadly diseases, such as cancer.  The project described herein will develop technological innovations in the emerging practice of laser-based disease diagnosis by tissue fluorescence spectroscopy, and will advance the understanding of this method in a range of future clinical applications.\r\n\r\nTissue fluorescence spectroscopy has been explored as a non-invasive means of detecting both cancers and pre-cancers in vivo.  Previous endoscopic studies in the gastrointestinal tract, cervix, lungs, and bladder have obtained diagnostic information from the spectral characteristics of the fluorescence emission.  To exploit the distinct advantages of fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy, this Principal Investigator recently developed and applied a fluorescence instrument providing simultaneous spectral and temporal resolution in vivo.  When used to detect colonic pre-cancers in vivo, the new technique revealed a high diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of routine clinical pathology.  It is thought that this new method may similarly improve the accuracy of pre-cancer diagnosis outside the colon, where time-resolved endoscopic measurements have not yet been reported.  The objective of the proposed work is both to further advance the technology of such an endoscopic fluorescence spectrometer and to pre-clinically test the innovative device on pre-cancerous cells from other organs, specifically the bronchial epithelial cells involved in lung cancer.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop an endoscopy compatible fluorescence spectrometer with simultaneous spectral and temporal resolution, based upon the designs of devices previously constructed by this Principal Investigator.  The biomedical instrument will be optimized for future use in clinical bronchoscopy procedures for lung cancer screening via a series of comprehensive pre-clinical experiments.  Pre-clinical testing will include an in vitro optical study on both primary cell cultures and unique immortalized, transformed (pre-cancerous), and chemoprevented bronchial epithelial cell lines, which the Co-Investigator (a clinical researcher from Dartmouth Medical School) has made available exclusively for this purpose.  Because these cells are derived from a unique cell line, characterizing their fluorescence emission properties represents a research opportunity available only to this team of investigators.  These in vitro experiments will thus serve both to advance understanding of the biophysical origins of the spectroscopic signatures of pre-cancer and to define the instrument parameters for future clinical application.  An additional objective of the pre-clinical testing is to explore data analysis techniques and computational models of tissue optical response to further develop viable diagnostic algorithms to be employed for clinical pre-cancer discrimination.\r\n\r\nEarly detection and resection of pre-cancers are critical to lowering cancer mortality rates.  The clinical device developed and pre-clinically tested in this project will offer physicians a non-invasive method of screening patients during endoscopy.  As a longer term goal, these studies may also serve as the basis for an endoscopic spectroscopic imaging device, coupling spectroscopic sensitivity with imaging technology, and allowing physicians to \"see\" otherwise invisible areas of pre-disease during endoscopic procedures.\r\n",
