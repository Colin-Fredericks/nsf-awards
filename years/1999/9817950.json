 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past ten years, no topic in human evolution that has attracted more attention from both the public and the research community than the origin of anatomically modern humans. It has been the subject of numerous conferences and edited volumes and has attracted the attention and efforts of scientists in a wide range of disciplines, including geology, paleontology, archeology, and genetics as well as paleoanthropologists. This project will contribute important new information to this issue by clarifying the chronometric position of a series of fossils collected several decades ago that have become critical documentation for an early appearance of anatomically modern humans in Africa, and will provide a broad framework for environmental and faunal change in East Africa during the past 130,000 years. In view of the previous finds from the \r\nKibish Formation and the extent of unexplored deposits, this project has the potential of providing new skeletal and archeological remains of modern humans during this critical time period that involved major cultural, and probably cognitive, advances in our species. \r\n\r\nA two month field season will be undertaken in January and February of 1999 with team composed of geologists, geochronologists, paleontologists and archeologists. The goals of this research will be to clarify the stratigraphy of previously collected hominid remains from the Kibish Formation and solidify the age of the different members through collection and subsequent analysis of datable materials, including volcanic ashes, wood or animal remains, and to survey for new paleontological and archeological sites.\r\n",
