 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Bruce Ault of the University of Cincinnati and Janet Del Bene of Youngstown State University will study two classes of oxidation-reduction reactions using matrix-isolation spectroscopy.  The first class consists of high-valent transition metal oxo compounds, specifically chromyl chloride and methyltrioxorhenium, and the second involves organic peroxides, with hydrogen peroxide as a prototype.  The goals of this project include identification of key intermediates in the reaction pathways, spectroscopic and structural characterization of these intermediates, comparison of experimental results to high-level theoretical calculations, and deduction of the reaction mechanism for these reactions.  The reactive intermediates will be trapped and preserved in cryogenic inert matrices using a range of deposition techniques and different forms of energy input to initiate reaction.  Trapped species will be characterized by infrared, Raman, and visible/ultraviolet spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nThis project will aid in understanding the mechanisms of oxidation reactions that are at the heart of current research into catalysis.  Oxidation of organics constitutes one of the most important reactions in industry, but environmental waste needs to be decreased and raw materials to be conserved better.  Other areas impacted by this work include atmospheric chemistry and air pollution, waste water treatment, the production of fine chemicals, and synthetic organic methodology.\r\n",
