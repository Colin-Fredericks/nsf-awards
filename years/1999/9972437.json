 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to learn what it means to conduct empirical research in Psychology, students need to design and analyze their own experiments.  However, students typically have few real interactions with the use of the microcomputer as a productive laboratory tool.  The problem has been the lack of software that allows undergraduates to build experiments on their own.  The shipping of the first version of the E-Prime system during the summer of 1999 opens up a fundamentally new way of addressing this problem.  E-Prime is a robust, commercial experiment generation system.  Because E-Prime is becoming recognized as the standard for building experiments in Psychology, it is now possible to construct a web-based resource that uses E-Prime as the delivery engine for a wide variety of instructional materials.  We will call this system STEP (System for the Teaching of Experimental Psychology).  There are seven specific goals in this project. \r\n1. Building a package of classic experiments appropriate for introductory psychology classes. \r\n2. Building 100 additional experiments as examples for the advanced undergraduate. \r\n3. Building computer \"wizards\" and QuickTime videos to teach experiment creation. \r\n4. Building tutorial materials to show students how to generate 30 classic experiments. \r\n5. Writing instructor manuals with HTML links between sample E-Prime experiments and specific topics covered in current textbooks on experimental design and experimental psychology. \r\n6. Working with the E-Prime development team to include new features that are important for the teaching of experimental psychology.  In particular, these will include ability to display and control multimedia, administer surveys, and record ongoing observational behaviors. \r\n7. Creating the social structures needed to support STEP.  The project will be evaluated using a pretest-posttest design, item analysis, objective usage figures, and usability studies.\r\n\r\n",
