 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe goal of this project is to ascertain the degree to which the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO) of the stratosphere and tropical deep convection are related.  The co-principal investigators found in a preliminary study which compared interannual variations in outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) in the tropics with a proxy for the QBO, the stratospheric zonal winds measured at Singapore.  The correlation for the 12-year period was large enough to warrant further exploration.  Drs. Hitchman and Martin will extend the period of their study to 23 years and will also investigate whether regional differences can be detected.  In the course of the study, they will examine a number of meteorological parameters near the tropopause with the hope of gaining insights into the possible physical mechanisms involved.  They will use a variety of data sets:  OLR data from several satellite instruments, Highly Reflective Cloud data, standard meteorological analyses from the European Centre for Medium Range Forecasting and reanalysis products from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction.   The results of this study should provide insights into the nature of large-scale tropical convection and the possibility of using the state of the tropical stratospheric winds for long-range forecasting of tropical convection on a regional basis.\r\n\r\n\tThe Climate Dynamics and Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology Programs jointly fund this award.\r\n",
