 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nFox\r\n\r\nThe project \"Non-Commutative Geometry and Harmonic Analysis\" is investigating several problems that use the techniques of non-commutative geometry and operator K-theory. We are developing elements in equivariant K-theory based on ideas from geometric quantization for semi-simple Lie groups. These constructions unify and extend previous constructions developed by Fox, Haskel, Julg, and Kasparov.  We are using non-commutative geometry to develop models of neural networks, which we hope will have several advantages over the classical models. The models should provide for greater computational efficiency and the framework should allow for the computation of invariants of the large-scale structure of the model.\r\n\r\nA. Connes and G. Kasparov have developed new areas of mathematics that provide tools for studying systems that are inherently complex. There have been a number of spectacular successes of these ideas when applied to mathematical problems in geometry and topology. The techniques are starting to be used on problems that were originally considered outside the scope of the theory and there is promise that these new tools will prove useful in a huge range of applications. This project consists of two programs using non-commutative geometry. The first program is studying ways that symmetry can incorporated into this new geometry. We have new techniques that we believe are natural and will shed light on the structure of geometric objects. The second program involves the use of non-commutative geometry to develop models of the brain and brain functions, commonly known as neural networks. The inherently complex structure of the brain has been a major stumbling block for mathematical modeling and one of our goals is to apply some of the techniques of non-commutative geometry to obtain new models of neural functioning.  An unexpected, but delightful, development has been serious communication between the mathematics department and the neuroscience community on our campus. A true collaboration at the undergraduate, graduate and research level is developing and promises to enrich both mathematics and biology. Mathematical neuroscience has a huge potential for applications (as already demonstrated by the applications of classical neural networks) which will increase as computational power increases and our understanding neural computation expands.\r\n",
