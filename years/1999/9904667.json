 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nIt has been established that a single gene, mid, located in the mt- locus, is necessary and sufficient to induce minus gametic differentiation and to suppress the expression of plus-specific gametic genes. It is further postulated that the Mid protein accomplishes these results by acting as a transcriptional activator/repressor in collaboration with other proteins. It is further postulated that Mid may collaborate with a different set of proteins to activate the expression of zygote specific genes following the fusion of plus and minus gametes. The first specific aim of this project is to test this \"mid hypothesis\". Antibodies will be raised against recombinant Mid protein and used to immunolocalize the protein and to perform immunoprecipitations of Mid plus any associated protein in wild type and mutant strains. The antibody will also be added to nuclei engaged in nuclear run-on transcription to assess whether it blocks or enhances transcription of gametic- and zygote-specific genes. The mid gene will be mutagenized in vitro to create temperature-sensitive alleles which, when transformed into a mid-deleted strain, should permit the identification of mid-regulated transcripts whose expression is up- or down-regulated with temperature increases. It has also been established that the mt locus is riddled with unusual genetic configurations suggesting that the region has been, and perhaps continues to be, a nucleus of evolutionary change.  The evolutionary history and potential of this locus will be investigated using several approaches. The second specific aim is to continue an ongoing chromosome walk through the mt locus of a closely related species, C. incerta, evaluating the extent to which its organization has been conserved vs rearranged with respect to the C. reinhardtii locus during the estimated 1 million years since the two species diverged. The third specific aim is to continue the evaluation of a recent (past 20 years) mt-related anomaly, the tandem duplication of the mid gene and flanking sequences and the residency of this element in a non-mt location in the genome of the CC-421 strain of C. reinhardtii.  The fourth specific aim is to continue to investigate the observation that the mid gene has incurred an unusually high level of nonsynonymous and synonymous codon changes since the C. reinhardtii/C. incerta divergence. \r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this research is to understand the genetic basis for life-cycle transitions in the unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, particularly with regard to the two mating-type loci and to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of these genetic systems.\r\n",
