Essentially,\r\nstratified systems are systems which can have multiple physical contacts (such as robotic hands or legged robotic locomotion), which results in a generic structure characterizing  the configuration space for the robot.  This generic structure can be exploited for control purposes.  This project will implement coordinated manipulation of objects by multiple robotic manipulators allowing for intermittent engagement of the objects by some or all of the manipulators.  The novelty of the approach is that it is formulated in sufficient mathematical generality so that the control algorithms are applicable to a broad class of objects to be manipulated. The PI has previously developed motion planning algorithms for stratified systems; however, they are fundamentally open loop. Because of the difficulty of accurately modeling the mechanics of a manipulator engaging or disengaging an object, very fine and precise motion will be difficult with a purely open loop control methodology.  Also, because of the highly nonlinear nature of stratified systems, small initial errors in motion will tend to grow with time making accurate large scale motions difficult as well. The goals of the experiments are to determine the practical extent and nature of these difficulties and to incorporate sensory information\r\n(both vision and contact sensors) in a discrete feedback control sense to improve the effectiveness of the stratified control methodology. Additionally, adaptive control methodologies will be used to supplement the stratified motion planning algorithms to enhance their robustness.\r\n",
