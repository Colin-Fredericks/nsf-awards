 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an approach adapted from materials presented by Catherine Mader of Hope College (Building and Sustaining an Undergraduate Research Program) and Louise Temple of Drew University and Brian Merkle of University of Wisconsin Green Bay (How to Survive as a Researcher in a Small Liberal Arts College) at the 1998 Project Kaleidoscope National Assembly and a small pilot project, students are using a research project approach to learning biology.  Students are sharpening their scientific reasoning and analytical skills by designing and conducting research experiments utilizing sophisticated techniques for gene expression (tissue cryosectioning, immunocytochemistry, enzyme cytochemistry, and in situ hybridization).  A number of courses are affected.  Developmental Biology students are: designing experiments to analyze the tissue-specific expressions of a gene during embryogenesis; performing labeling experiments for visualization of this expression in embryo sections; recording and analyzing their data using an image analysis station; and disseminating their scientific data at a student poster session at the end of the semester.  Cell Biology students perform similar laboratory projects involving enzyme cytochemistry.  Molecular Biology, Immunology, Microscopic Anatomy and Molecular Genetics courses are also adapting the new approach and implementing use of the new equipment.",
