 "awd_abstract_narration": "Songs of the male Hawaiian cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus attract both female crickets for mating and deadly parasitic flies.  Males that sing in risky ways (e.g., more pulses in the song) are more likely to attract both females and flies.  Moreover female crickets attracted to a male may themselves become parasitized.  The project goal is to show that the chance of attracting flies varies among the Hawaiian islands, and that male singing and female responses to song vary accordingly.  Song variables and singing schedules of male crickets will be characterized for each island to determine whether risky singing is less common where flies are more likely to attack.  Females from each island will be tested to see if preference for risky song is reduced on islands with high fly attraction.  This research, then, will examine the tradeoffs involved in mate attraction versus parasite avoidance.\r\n\r\nMating is paramount for animals to pass their genes on to future generations.  This project investigates how variation in mating behavior is associated with the presence of natural enemies.  This is important for the conservation of animal diversity because the distribution patterns of animals are influenced by predators and parasites.  It is also crucial for programs in which natural enemies such as parasites are used as alternatives to pesticides to control pests.  \r\n",
