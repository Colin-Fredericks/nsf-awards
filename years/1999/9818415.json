Cryptography is of central importance for security in information technology systems.  Due to the algorithm independent design paradigm of modern security protocols, high flexibility with respect to algorithm choice and algorithm parameters is extremely desirable.  At the same time the hardware realization of cryptographic algorithms is highly desirable for performance as well as for physical security reasons.  In order to overcome the reduced flexibility of traditional hardware approaches, the implementation of cryptographic alrogithms on reconfigurable hardware (RCHW) is a promising answer.  The research conducted through the requested equipment (high-end workstations and a hardware development lab) deals with the detailed investigation and implementation of the cited research using RCHW.  The VHDL based designs of full-size public and private-key algorithms pose challenges to existing automated design tools (synthesis and place and route tools) which can only be met with the requested high-end workstations.  The physical implementation of algorithm-agile systems, such as high performance prototype boards that allow algorithm switch on the fly, requires modern hardware development tools.  The required hardware development equipment includes a logic analyzer, data and functions generators, and digital oscilloscopes.",
