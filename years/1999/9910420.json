 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the potential application of a new technology, functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI), to the study of two established research topics in the social psychology of close relationships. The research will focus on (a) differences in how information is processed about self and close others versus self and strangers, and (b) feelings and motivations associated with close relationships. fMRI is a noninvasive method for visualizing neural activation in the human brain. This technology permits the researcher to localize activity that reflects specific brain processes occurring during the presentation of experimentally manipulated material. Thus, for example, in the set of studies focusing on the first topic, each participant will rate a series of personality traits for the extent to which each is true of his or her self (the self-focus condition), his or her spouse (the close-other-focus condition), or an entertainment personality (the stranger-focus-condition). A comparison of areas of brain activation elicited under these three conditions permits an assessment of a theoretical model of close relationships which holds that information about close others is processed more similarly to the way self-related information is processed than to the way stranger-related information is processed.\r\n\r\nFindings from these studies will advance scientific knowledge by helping discriminate among competing theories about basic social processes involving cognition, emotion, and motivation regarding close others. It will do so mainly by helping determine whether various experiences thought to be due to highly similar processes are associated with neural activation in the same brain regions. In addition, because these are among the first social psychological studies using this new technology, they will test its potential for the field in general, opening the way for broader use of fMRI technology in social psychological research.\r\n",
