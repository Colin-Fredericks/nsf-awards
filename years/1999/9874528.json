Technical\r\n\r\nThe \"DEAD-box\" RNA helicase domain is a conserved ~400 residue protein\r\nmodule that has an essential role in a broad spectrum of activities in RNA\r\nmetabolism, including ribosome assembly, initiation of polypeptide\r\ntranslation, mRNA splicing, RNA degradation, and others.  The helicase\r\ndomain is thought to facilitate rearrangments of specific RNA structures in\r\nprecisely controlled, ATP-dependent reactions. Different representatives of\r\nthe DEAD-box domain family function as individual \"stand alone\" proteins,\r\nas subdomains in the context of larger, multidomain polypeptides up to\r\n~1300 residues in length, and also as subunits of multiprotein complexes.\r\nThe overall goal of this study is to determine the structures and RNA\r\nbinding specificities of DEAD-box proteins.  First, the x-ray\r\ncrystallographic structure of a representative DEAD-box protein, the\r\nelongation factor eIF4a from yeast. will be solved.  This will provide a \r\nprototype structure of the helicase module.  Incorporating the structure         \r\ninto the design of subsequent experiments, (i) several eubacterial \r\nDEAD-box proteins which differ significantly in biological function will\r\nbe expressed and purified, and (ii) their RNA binding specificities will be\r\ndetermined using in vitro selection methods.  Using the consensus RNA target\r\nsequences that emerge from the selection experiments, defined RNA \r\noligonucleotides will be synthesized and their interaction with their cognate \r\nDEAD-box proteins will be measured directly.  Additionally,\r\ncrystallization of RNA-protein complexes will be attempted with the goal of\r\nsolving their structure.\r\n\r\n2. Non-technical\r\n\r\nRNA metabolism is a required function for cell viability.  A diverse set of\r\nproteins participate in activities such as splicing and degradation of\r\nmessenger RNA, initiation of polypeptide translation through specific\r\ninteractions with messenger RNA, and assembly of the RNA-protein\r\ncomplexes in the ribosome.  Although each of these activities utilizes a\r\nunique set of proteins, they share a common \"RNA chaperone\" function\r\nthat is carried out by a highly conserved RNA helicase domain.  This\r\ndomain, which is about 400 amino acids in size, must carry out a\r\nbiochemical activity that is essential to the entire spectrum of the\r\nbiological activities in which these proteins participate.  The goal of\r\nthis work is to understand the participation of this protein module in the\r\nbiochemical mechanisms of RNA metabolism.  The method for accomplishing\r\nthis will be to first solve the three-dimensional structure of this RNA\r\nchaperone domain, and then to determine the basis of its specificity in\r\ndifferent biological functions.  The first goal will be accomplished using\r\nthe technique of x-ray crystallography, and the second will use both in\r\nvitro selection techniques to determine specific RNA sequences to which the\r\nproteins bind, and crystallography to solve the structures of protein-RNA\r\ncomplexes.\r\n",
