These educators will conduct pairs of two-day regional workshops at up to 10 engineering schools during a one-year period.  One of the primary goals of the program will be to identify some of the most promising new innovations in engineering education that have resulted from NSF-supported research and transfer this information broadly into the engineering education community.  The intent of this activity is to enhance the quality of engineering education by conducting faculty workshops which will impart a better understanding of the current innovations in teaching and learning methods, curricular content, collaborative learning, and assessment outcomes.  Through its network of engineering deans and department heads, ASEE will identify schools who will host these workshops.  ASEE will produce a brochure about the workshops and promote these workshops throughout its nationwide membership.  ASEE will work with each host institution to promote the workshops to other nearby institutions.  In addition to the institutional visits, ASEE proposes to organize a two day national conference which will feature new and innovative teaching and earning approaches that have resulted from NSF-supported research and provide engineering educators with information and the tools needed to enhance their teaching and research.\r\n",
