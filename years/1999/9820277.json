 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marine Sciences Research Center, SUNY Stony Brook will serve as a site for summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates providing opportunities for 8 upper division undergraduate students majoring in chemistry, biology, geology, physics, atmospheric science, or engineering. Summer fellows will conduct individual research under the guidance of a faculty mentor and participate in a coordinated group project to study marine/estuarine processes associated with the development of water column and seabed hypoxia in Long Island Sound. Our program will provide considerable 'hands-on' experience in the field with small boats and sampling gear, and in the laboratory with basic analytical instruments. It will demonstrate the importance of teamwork in gathering and sharing data, and will illustrate the usefulness of scientific research for understanding real-world problems. Informal weekly sessions will feature guest speakers and discussions of ethical and social issues associated with being a research scientist, an environmentalist, resource manager, or government official. Additionally, many social activities including field trips and sports events will take place throughout the summer at MSRC and on campus with other undergraduates engaged in research programs.\r\n\r\n",
