BALK\r\n\r\nUniversity of Utah\r\n\r\nTurbulent Transport by Waves\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe basic problem considered in this proposal is the Transport of\r\na Passive Scalar in a prescribed velocity field which is \r\na superposition of waves. The spreading of an oil spill on the ocean \r\nsurface can serve as an example. The objective is \r\nto derive an equation for the averaged evolution of the passive\r\nscalar in the ensemble of random waves. The analysis of this\r\nbasic problem is used for the investigation of Wave Turbulence \r\n(dynamics of a system of random waves weakly interacting with each\r\nother). \r\nThe proposal contains also the description of two related projects \r\nabout systems with Strong Nonlinearity: Rayleigh-Taylor Instability \r\nand Materials with Non-Monotone Stress-Strain Relation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn practical terms the problem of Turbulent Transport by\r\nWaves can be put like this. Suppose oil is spilled in the ocean. Ocean\r\nwaves have a profound effect on the evolution of this spill.\r\nThe first goal of the proposal is to derive an equation for the\r\ndrift and spreading of the spill. The same mathematical problem\r\narises in other problems of the ENVIRONMENT: the\r\nspreading of pollutants in the atmosphere or the motion of\r\nphytoplankton in the ocean. We also apply the problem of\r\nTurbulent Transport by Waves for the investigation of Turbulence\r\nof Waves, such as ocean waves, or sound waves, or planetary\r\nwaves, which govern the weather. All these problems are important\r\nfor the understanding of the ENVIRONMENT and GLOBAL CHANGE.\r\nTwo related projects about systems with Strong Nonlinearity \r\nare included in the proposal as well: (1) the so called\r\nRayleigh-Taylor instability, which is crucial for the NUCLEAR FUSION\r\n(with inertial confinement); (2) the dynamics of solids with\r\nnon-monotone stress-strain relation (stretching of such a solid\r\ncan decrease the resisting force). The later could lead to\r\ndeveloping of MATERIALS capable of withstanding strong repeated\r\nperturbations. Power plants in seismic regions or armor can serve\r\nas examples.\r\n",
