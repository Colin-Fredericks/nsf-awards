 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861001\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will integrate a large scale, validated hurricane simulation technique, a validated hurricane wind field model and a validated storm surge model coupled with the existing WAM wave model (The WAMDI Group, 1988) to develop the first risk consistent modeling of the combined action of wind, storm surge and waves produced by hurricanes.  The storm surge/wave analysis and resulting flood maps produced by FEMA were not developed in a statistically rigorous manner, and thus the true return periods associated with the 100 year flood level is, in fact, not known.  To assess the risk of storm damage to structures, the combined action of wind and flood (including both surge and wave runup) must be treated as they are inherently coupled, and damage in many cases is produced by a combination of the two storm perils.  The simulation approach, which employs an extensively validated wind field model, will determine simultaneous values of wind speed, storm surge and wave runup that can be analyzed to assess the risk associated with anyone of the individual perils or the risk associated with any combination of multiple perils.  This body of work will represent the first risk consistent study of the combined action of wind, storm surge and wave action.\r\n     The primary commercial application for this research includes a new risk consistent approach for insurance companies to assess their true total risk.  The new approach may yield further business opportunities for insurance companies in many cases, relieving the Federal Government of some of its risk.  Other potential applications include the utility industry, who with this research will be able to produce more cost effective transmission and distribution system designs in coastal areas.\r\n",
