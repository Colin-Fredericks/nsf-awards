As example, high reliability blue LEDs have applications in full-color flat panel displays, projection displays, traffic lights, and indicator lights.  Blue diode lasers are especially sought for digital compact disk storage applications.  GaN-based photodetectors are useful as solar blind UV detectors.  GaN-based transistors will find applications in high temperature, radiation hard, and uncooled electronics, especially in avionics and spacecraft systems.\r\n\r\nThe reliability of current state-of-the-art GaN-based devices such as blue emitter and high temperature transistors is limited.  Blue diode laser lifetimes, for example, are only tens of hours.  This is widely attributed to the fact that most GaN devices are grown on lattice mismatched substrates such as sapphire which results in high dislocation densities: typically 1010 cm-2.\r\n\r\nWe have demonstrated a technology to produce 10 x 10 mm2 single crystal GaN substrates with low dislocation densities (~106 to 107 cm-2) which when used to fabricate GaN lasers and transistors will enable a quantum leap in device reliability.  Laser lifetimes of 50,000 hours are now within reach.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to produce large area (2 inch diameter) bulk single crystals of gallium nitride by utilizing the rapid growth rates afforded by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) and growing on novel lattice-matched lithium gallium oxide (lithium gallate, LiGaO2) substrate.  A thin MOCVD-grown gallium nitride film will protect the oxide substrate from attack by HCI during HVPE.  A self-separation technique that leaves free-standing flat GaN without requiring mechanical or chemical treatment, has been demonstrated for small area samples and this technique will be advanced to larger area.\r\n***\r\n",
