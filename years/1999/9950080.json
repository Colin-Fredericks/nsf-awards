 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nJob-based problems similar to those technology students are likely to encounter when they begin work in industrial settings are not widely available for technical physics courses. Consequently, students frequently fail to see the relevance of physics to their studies and may not recognize physics-based applications when they encounter them on the job. The objective of this project is to develop 40 job-based problem sets for technical physics. These problems will be developed by physics and technology instructors jointly, representatives from the Metropolitan Manufacturing Technology Center and employeesfrom small industries in the Birmingham area.  A variety of light  and heavy manufacturing settings to be visited by the instructors will provide the foundation for the actual work place, job-based problems from these industries.  These authentic problems will be adapted for use in the algebra-based technical physics course.  Photographs, videos and scale drawings from the industrial setting will be included. Each problem will be developed so that multiple variables can be solved for to make the problems adaptable to a variety of student needs.   Problems from the areas of motion, force, torque, and electricity will be developed from several different work places. The problems will be field-tested by instructors and students from at least three other colleges before being distributed to other technical physics teachers at national and regional meetings. Completed problems will be made  available via links to Jefferson State's web page and in a CD ROM format. An outside evaluator will determine whether including job-based problems in the course affects the attitude of technology students toward physics and makes them better prepared for the workforce.",
