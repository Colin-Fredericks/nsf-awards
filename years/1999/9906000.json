 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-term project to elucidate how mutations are generated and recovered in plant mitochondria and what effects these mutations have on plant phenotypes and cellular function will be continued. An investigation into the effects on cellular function of a set of lethal mitochondrial mutations (nonchromosomal) stripe, NCS) that are propagated in heteroplasmic maize plants will be continued. It has been recently found that two types of nucleus-encoded plant mitochondrial stress proteins, alternative oxidase (AOX) and HSP22 are dramatically increased in all of the NCS mutants. It is proposed to determine at what level this induction occurs and to identify other mitochondrial proteins that are differentially regulated in NCS plants. A second objective is to learn how the integrity of plant mitochondrial genomes is maintained. The genomes exist in vivo as a collection of subgenomes, which result from active recombination. Nonetheless, mitochondrial genotypes and their subgenomic complements are usually faithfully transmitted from maternal parent to progeny. In an exceptional line of maize, P2, it has been found that nitochondrial genomes are surprisingly variable and that novel, small subgenomes are amplified to high levels. The hypothesis that these small mtDNA circles carry origins of replication that allow their amplification will be tested. Two of the independently amplified small subgenomes have been found to be maternally heritable in crosses, which may help to identify those regions of the mitochondrial genome that are critical for the proper segregation and efficient replication of mtDNA.\r\n\r\nInterest in mitochondria has intensified recently due to their central roles in phenomena such as programmed cell death, oxidative stress and organellar retrograde regulation. In retrograde regulation, the expression of certain nuclear genes is transcriptionally activated in response to changes in the metabolic state of organelles. The results of this investigation will give further insight into the genomic regulation of mitrochondrial function.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
