 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much creative work and the development of innovations in science, industry, and organizations involves some degree of group interaction. A number of scholars in different disciplines have begun to study the creative process in groups. As a result, a number of interesting findings and theoretical models have been generated. Some aspects of the group process seem to hinder group creativity and can lead groups to have rather inflated perceptions of their effectiveness.  However, under certain conditions groups can enhance the creative process by effectively sharing the unique intellectual resources of the group members. This conference will bring together scholars from the topic areas of cognitive psychology, creativity, groups, and organizations to discuss the factors that influence group creativity and innovation.  Fourteen scholars from five different countries will make presentations. Because they come from different disciplines within psychology, many of these scholars do not typically have an opportunity to interact at conferences. Other scholars and graduate students will be invited to participate in the discussion process. The aim of the conference is to stimulate additional empirical work and theoretical development on the topic of group creativity. The conference will also facilitate efforts at theoretical integration and the development of new research paradigms. An increased understanding of the creative process in groups will provide useful information for more effective utilization of the creative potential of groups and teams in science and industry. The conference presentations will be the basis for a published volume on group creativity.\r\n",
