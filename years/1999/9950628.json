 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Shaping the Future (NSF96-139), the Review Committee describes a research-rich, inquiry-based process, where students work on real problems with each other and their faculty, as the underpinning of effective undergraduate education.  In many institutions and disciplines, projects have undertaken to implement this approach with some evident success.  \r\n\r\nFollowing the lead of these earlier innovators, this project is working to infuse research into the curriculum, thereby increasing students' understanding of science.  Students are engaging in sustained, involved examples of scientific investigation. The project uses an equipment-based approach, and a curricular design that supports quantitative, inquiry-based investigations as the core of six undergraduate courses at the introductory, intermediate, and advanced levels.  In these courses, students tackle fewer real-world problems, in greater depth. \r\n\r\nBeyond mapping and reporting, students are now engaged in quantitative measurement and analysis, enabling them to see whole links between posing a problem, making accurate measurements, and exploring and analyzing data. Students in these courses are engaging in several realistic research experiences, starting with a general investigation of a problem, then moving on to forming hypotheses, \"seeing\" the need for data, learning to treat phenomena in the world as measured quantities, learning how to portray that data, and beyond that, understanding how to model the results and apply statistical tests. Students will develop thinking skills that are not cookbook, follow-the-directions exercises, but real think-it-out investigation. They will see statistics as more of a useful tool and less of an academic hurdle. \r\n\r\nAt least three earlier projects have clearly influenced his current proposal.  These are: \r\n->  A project at Pennsylvania State University that targeted sophomores in biology.  These students now experience the whole research process in sophomore level biology, from initial observations and hypothesis formation, to data acquisition, analysis, and presentation of results (The Scientific Method and Computer Literacy: A New Biology Lab Curriculum at PSU, C. L. Devlin, grant # 9451683).  \r\n-> Introductory zoology courses at Idaho State University.   The first year of zoology used to be \"an uninspiring experience of rote or passive learning and formula 'cookbook' experiments.\" It has been replaced with \"open-ended labs and investigations in which students hypothesize, interpret data, communicate and defend their results.\" (Improving General Zoology Students' Understanding of the Nature and Process of Science Through Inquiry and Investigation, S. J. Belzer, grant number # 981264). \r\n-> Intermediate level geography at Salisbury State.  The goal in this project is to institute effective instruction, with an emphasis on project-oriented teaching and learning, so students better understand the holistic aspect of geographic problems.  In this project the goal for student learning is \"better grasp the coherent links between content-based courses and technique-oriented courses\" (Geography Computing Laboratory, S. Mara Chen, grant # 9851009).  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
