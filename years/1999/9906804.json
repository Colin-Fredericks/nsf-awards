This project differs from past hunter-gatherer site location studies by including both archaeological and oral historical data.  Subsistence efficiency and landscape-based behavioral models are more effectively tested with subsistence and extra-subsistence factors like conflict, religion, politics, and personal preference.  A total cultural perception is utilized rather than just a strongly materialist archaeological record, which enhances and improves model testing and further model development.  Variables measuring and defining factors involved in site location selection will be coded from existing oral histories and site reports collected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and from a regional satellite image based GIS developed for this study.  Multivariate statistics will identify relationships or lack thereof between factors and archaeological sites.  This process will result in an understanding of what aspects of site location were important to Cup'iks c. 1900.  It will define a cultural perception of the landscape specific to the time and place.  For archaeology as a whole, the project will increase our ability to explain and predict hunter-gatherer site location selection processes and site location patterns throughout time and space.\r\n\r\n",
