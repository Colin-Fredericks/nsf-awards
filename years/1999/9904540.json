 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Christopher Henshilwood and Frederick Grine will conduct archaeological research at the site of Blombos cave, date its sediments and analyze the materials recovered. The goal of the research is to understand the emergence of modern human behavior and, based on excavations to date, Blombos can contribute significantly.  Although early hominids made stone tools as early as 2.4 million years ago, and thus shared significant traits with their modern day counterparts, in many other ways they were clearly distinct. By 40,000 years ago however archaeological evidence indicates they buried their dead and thus had some form of religion. They painted lifelike animal and human figures on cave walls and adorned their own bodies. Thus, although their technology was simple they were essentially like us. Based on fossil evidence the earliest anatomically modern humans appeared ca. 125,000 years ago in sub Saharan Africa and preliminary data indicates that the first traces of \"modern\" behavior are found in that part of the world as well. These are associated with Middle Stone Age peoples who practiced a culture which extended from ca. 250,000 to 40,000 years ago. However archaeologists do not agree on the range of behaviors present in MSA groups and given the extensive temporal span, it is quite possible that these significantly changed within this interval itself. In this context Blombos Cave is extremely important. Located on the southern Cape coast, it contains excellently preserved MSA materials which have not previously been found in situ in this region. Preliminary excavations in 1997 and 1998 have yielded remarkable, yet anomalous, finds that are directly relevant to the modern human behavior debate. These include formal bone artifacts, pressure-flaked bifacial foliate points, rotary drilled haematite and evidence for modern subsistence practices including fishing. In other regions of the world all of these are significantly younger and form part of a modern behavioral complex. With NSF support these excavations will be expanded to increase sample size and to examine lateral variation within the site. The abundant lithics and fauna as well as other material remains will be analyzed and an extensive multi-approach dating program conducted.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons. It will provide valuable data from a unique and important site and will increase our understanding of the complex of traits which characterize behaviorally modern humans.\r\n",
