Doyle, contributes to support the US - Taiwan Symposium on Organometallic Chemistry and Catalysis.  The symposium will be held at the National Taiwan University in Taipei, Taiwan on April 10-13, 1999. Seven invited speakers from the United States will present papers on recent achievements in this research area, as will seven invited speakers from Taiwan. Short talks and papers from researchers in Taiwan and other countries in Southeast Asia will also be included.  The event is designed to increase collaborative research between faculty from the US and Southeast Asia.  This field was selected for interaction because of its history of rapid growth and vitality, its applications in industry, and its importance in the development of environmentally benign synthetic methods.",
