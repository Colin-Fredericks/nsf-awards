These programs will be the initial programs in a continuing series of television portraits of distinguished scientists to be broadcast as regular features in the prime-time science series NOVA.  The scientists to be covered in the first four programs are Galileo Galilei, Charles Darwin, Marie Curie, and Percy Julian.  By illuminating the lives and scientific careers of these important figures, the programs will enhance public understanding of such basic scientific concepts as evolution, the solar system, the chemical bond and the structure of the atom.  Ultimately, the programs will give viewers a new perspective on the process of scientific discovery.  \r\n\r\nAncillary educational support for the programs will include enhanced content on the web site at NOVA Online and classroom support material in the NOVA Teacher's Guide that is mailed to 60,000 teachers nationwide.  WGBH also has formed an outreach partnership with the American Library Association to create informal educational resources for use by families, youths, and adults.  The core of this special outreach plan is a set of Library Resource Kits that will be available to all 16,000 public libraries.  \r\n\r\nPaula Apsell, Executive Producer for NOVA, will serve as PI for the project.  Members of the advisory committee include:  Evelyn Fox Keller, Professor of History and Philosophy of Science, MIT; Kenneth R. Manning, Thomas Meloy Professor of Rhetoric and of the History of Science, MIT; Noami Oreskes, Associate Professor of History, University of California, San Diego; Daniel I. Rubenstein, Chair of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University; and Neil D. Tyson, Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
