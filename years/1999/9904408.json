Using a questionnaire to measure cultural motive schemas shared by socio-cultural groups, the student in collaboration with her adviser will compare questionnaires and semi-structured interview data from Vietnamese Americans.  The questionnaire date will be analyzed using principal components analysis and the interview data will be analyzed using discourse analysis techniques developed by anthropologists for the purpose of discovering cultural schemas.  With clearer documentation of Vietnamese American cultural schemas and orientations, the researchers will proceed to conduct statistical analyses to investigate the association between cultural and social structural variables.  Analysis of data from further unstructured interviews will document the sets of motive schemas composing individuals' personalities. \r\nThis project develops reliable, valid measures of the cultural and psychological variables discussed in immigration studies.  Such methods are a necessary component of social scientists' ability to compare their findings with those of others and to more accurately model the determinants of economic and psychological outcomes.  The results from this project can advance our understanding of the fundamental causes of the relative economic success of Southeast Asian Americans. In addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist. \r\n\r\n",
