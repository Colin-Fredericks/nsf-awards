Technical\r\n\r\nThe biofabrication of mineralized structures, or biomineralization, is an\r\norganism-directed process which leads to composite material formation. An\r\ninteresting class of biomineral-related proteins are the so-called \"acidic\"\r\nproteins found in association with apatites and calcium carbonates. These\r\nproteins, which contain significant amounts of Asp, Glu, and in some cases\r\nphosphorylated Ser residues, can bind Ca (II) ions and initiate crystal\r\ngrowth. Paradoxically, these same proteins may also bind stereospecifically\r\nto the exposed surfaces of forming mineral crystals, thereby inhibiting\r\ngrowth along specific crystallographic axes. But are all \"acidic\" proteins\r\ncreated equal? Recent experiments have demonstrated that the resulting\r\nmineral morphology is directly related to specific amino acid sequences in\r\nspecific proteins. What is most exciting is the possibility that sequence\r\nrepeats in these proteins could represent a diverse \"library\" of Ca (II)\r\nrecognition sites and folding mini-domains: by using similar or different\r\ncombinations of sequence repeats, a given \"acidic\" protein could \"tailor\"\r\nits local structure to match a specific crystal morphology or create a\r\nspecific crystal morphology. This study will investigate the similarities\r\nand differences within the known \"acidic\" sequence repeat library. By using\r\na multidisciplinary approach, specific sequence repeats will be examined\r\nwith regard to Ca (II) binding, conformational change, crystal growth\r\ninduction, and crystal morphology matching. These results will provide a\r\ndatabase that will not only advance our understanding of \"acidic\" protein\r\nstructure and function, but also provide the basis for the creation of\r\nsynthetic \"peptidomimetics\" and polymers that can generate novel or\r\nimportant crystal morphologies, and, ultimately, novel composite materials.\r\nAs part of this project, an educational strategy involving participation\r\nof high school, college undergraduate, and graduate students will be\r\nimplemented; independence, problem-solving skills and team cooperation will\r\nbe emphasized.\r\n\r\n2. Non-technical\r\n\r\nThere are a number of naturally-occurring biological-based materials --\r\nsuch as sea shell and plankton exoskeleton -- which are constructed by\r\norganisms for protection and support. These bio-based materials are unique,\r\nin that they combine inorganic solids (minerals) with polymers (proteins,\r\npolysaccharides). The resulting materials are usually very strong, and, are\r\nassembled by organisms under biological conditions. Hence, \"bio-inspired\"\r\nmaterials offer a new strategy-- namely, using self-assembly and molecule -\r\nmolecule recognition as \"building techniques\" -- for creating unique\r\nmaterials for aerospace, industry, and medicine. To do this successfully,\r\nit is important to understand how proteins and polysaccharides recognize\r\nand bind to inorganic solids. This research will explore the issue of how\r\n\"acidic\" proteins, such as those found in sea shells, bones, and teeth,\r\nparticipate in the assembly of composite inorganic - organic materials. A\r\ncombination of physical techniques will be employed to study the structure\r\nof sequence repeats found in \"acidic\" proteins. The results obtained from\r\nthese studies will be used to create a molecular \"blueprint\" for \"acidic\"\r\nproteins, wherein important and unimportant regions for mineral recognition\r\ncan be identified. Eventually, this information will be used to create\r\n\"designer\" proteins or polymers which can perform specific functions during\r\nbio-inspired material assembly. This research project will also serve as a\r\nteaching tool for the training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate\r\nscience majors, wherein problem-solving skills and cross-discipline\r\ntraining will be featured.\r\n",
