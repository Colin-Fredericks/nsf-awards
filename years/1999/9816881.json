 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Drosophila decapentaplegic gene product (Dpp) is a member of the transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) superfamily of secreted growth and differentiation factors.  TGF-bs mediate their functions via a signal transduction pathway that results in the transcriptional activity of specific genes, and eventually leads to specific cellular responses.  The pathway is partially elucidated and includes transmembrane receptor kinases that phosphorylate cytoplasmic molecules called Smads, which then translocate to the nucleus.  Smads have been implicated as transcriptional activators of pathway-target genes in several organisms.\r\nDpp acts in a concentration-dependent manner to influence the fates of many cells.  During early embryonic development, high levels of Dpp instruct the dorsal-most fate (squamous epithelial cells of the amnioserosa), while lower levels instruct more lateral fates (hair cells of the epidermis).  Even the lowest levels of the Dpp gradient directs patterning (edge denticles of the ventral epidermis).  Thus, the expression and activity of Dpp must be highly regulated to ensure proper patterning of the dorsal region.\r\n\r\nSeveral genes are known to influence Dpp activity by a variety of mechanisms.  They positively or negatively regulate either Dpp transcription, Dpp binding to its receptors, or downstream components of the pathway, for example at the level of Smad activation.  It is a broad goal to understand how the Dpp pathway is regulated, and in turn, how the pathway regulates downstream gene expression.  Recently, a new kind of negative regulator was discovered to be encoded by the brinker gene. brinker is just as important as the well-characterized inhibitor, Sog, in setting up the Dpp gradient.  Genetic data indicates that brinker acts cell autonomously and downstream of the Dpp receptors, unlike Sog, which acts extracellularly to inhibit the Dpp ligand.  Brinker was recently cloned and shown to encode a novel protein.  In all embryonic and larval tissues where Dpp is expressed, brinker is expressed in a reciprocal pattern, suggesting that it may be a more general inhibitor than Sog of Dpp.  Two possible mechanisms for Brinker protein function are:\r\nas an inhibitor of Smad nuclear localization or activity, and as a direct transcriptional repressor of downstream target genes, including Dpp itself.  The experiments in the proposal are designed to specifically determine 1) where Brinker fits into the Dpp pathway and whether it can function independently of the Smads, 2) whether Brinker interacts with Smads and/or other transcription factors, and 3) whether Brinker can act as a transcriptional regulator in both Drosophila and mammalian systems.\r\n\r\n",
