 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9970489\r\n\r\nIn this proposal a number of projects will be undertaken.  As one\r\nof the main areas of research, uniform asymptotic theories involving a\r\ncoalescing turning point and pole, developed earlier by Dunster, will be\r\nused in the study of non-classical orthogonal polynomials (with an emphasis\r\non the Meixner, Pollaczek and Charlier polynomials).  These earlier\r\nasymptotic theories will also be used in the study of certain singularly\r\nperturbed boundary value problems arising from population biology.  Also in\r\nthis proposal Dunster intends to sum certain classical uniform asymptotic\r\nAiry function expansions (involving a large parameter and a turning point)\r\ninto convergent representations.  The new results would then have an\r\nimmediate application to Bessel functions of large order and Legendre\r\nfunctions of large degree. A central and unifying component of the proposed\r\nproblems is the development of explicit and realistic error bounds.\r\n\r\nMore generally, this proposal is based on the approximation of the\r\nso-called special functions. Special functions are solutions of certain\r\nequations which appear in many areas of physics, engineering and\r\nmathematics.  This is a very classical branch of mathematics that has\r\nalready contributed much to our understanding of the physical world.\r\nNumerical and theoretical results concerning special functions are still of\r\ngreat importance in virtually all of the physical sciences. Morever, during\r\nthe past decade there have been a series of new and exciting ideas leading\r\nto significant improvements in the accuracy of asymptotic methods, such as\r\nthe so-called \"exponential asymptotics\" pioneered by the mathematical\r\nphysicist Michael Berry. In this project Dunster intends to use and extend\r\nthese ideas in a number of directions. One aspect of the proposal is to\r\nobtain approximations which are valid for a wider range of variables than\r\nobtained previously.  An immediate advantage of these more powerful\r\napproximations is that there is greater flexibility in their use in\r\nnumerical applications, as well as having important theoretical\r\nimplications.\r\n\r\n",
