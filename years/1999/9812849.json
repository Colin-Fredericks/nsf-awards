 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combinatorial optimization involves the efficient choice of an optimal element from a large, implicitly-described set.  Instances of such problems occur in many important applied domains (e.g., airline-crew scheduling, manufacturing logistics, VLSI-circuit design, routing, and experimental design).  Many such problems can be formulated as integer-programming packing or covering problems.  Indeed, such formulations have been the most successful means of attacking many of these problems.  Useful algorithmic and structural insights, which often have direct impact on our ability to solve practical instances of these problems, are achieved through the theories of integral polyhedra, graphs, hypergraphs, matroids and clutters.  In particular, decomposition methods play a central role.  Our project is a five-day conference, held at the University of Kentucky, devoted to this topic.  The main activity of this conference is a series of ten lectures by Dr. Gerard Cornuejols of Carnegie Mellon University.  The lectures will serve to introduce mathematicians (established researchers in discrete mathematics and in other areas, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students) to current research in packing and covering.  This conference is particularly timely since the field has seen rapid development in the last several years, in terms of both theory and application.",
