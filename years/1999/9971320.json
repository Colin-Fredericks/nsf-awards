 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe first part of the work utilizes a characterization of textured patterns, referred to as the \"disorder function,\" which measures the deviation of a pattern from a perfect plan form.  It was shown to be a parameter dependent, but configuration independent aspect of textures.  A study of patterns generated in model systems showed that the pattern formation consists of two stages.  The initial formation of striped domains from the random background exhibits trivial scaling while the (later) domain coarsening is nontrivial.  We will study analogous relaxation of experimental patterns (done in Prof. H. L. Swinney's lab) in a vibrated layer of sand.  Next, we propose to quantify configuration independent aspects of textured patterns formed in magnetic bubble systems and ferrofluids.  The parameter dependence of the disorder function for the textures will be studied.  Thirdly, as an application of the philosophy, we propose to use pattern characterization to estimate the \"roughness\" of a metal surface on a nanometer scale.  The idea is to characterize the disorder in an image obtained by scattering a laser beam off the surface.  A preliminary numerical study will be followed by an experimental collaboration.  Such a characterization is expected find application in auto industry.\r\n\tThe second problem is the development of methods to perform modal decomposition of experimental patterns.  The methods utilizing Karhunen-Loeve decomposition have been developed.  As an application, we will analyze cellular states observed in a flame front (Prof. M. Gorman's group) and oscillation of a lattice generated in a vibrated layer of sand (Prof. Swinney's group).  Knowledge of the principal modes and their symmetries will allow us to develop normal form theories for the states.  Consequences of the theory will be compared with results from the experiments.\r\n",
