 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860374\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is a proof of principle for the fabrication of high density, highly adhesive, lubricious, ultra hard boron coatings using a vacuum cathodic arc with a heated, solid boron cathode.  The preferred structure of the coating will be an amorphous sub oxide of boron (11 or 22 B to 1 O), which has a high surface hardness to elastic modulus ratio and has been and produced (with less commercially attractive methods) and studied at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  The technical tasks are to improve an existing cathodic arc setup for better vacuum integrity, improve the structural integrity of the boron cathode and its support structure, as well as the method of heating the cathode.  The resulting films will be analyzed  at the same ORNL facility, where the previously studied boron coatings were produced and analyzed.  The emphasis in this phase is in achieving the correct stoichiometry.  The advantages of the cathodic arc are control of ion energies, low substrate temperatures and the avoidance of toxic gases involved in plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition.\r\n     Boron coatings have excellent hardness, tribological (low friction) and corrosion resistance properties.  Their high temperature compatibility would make them ideal for advanced automotive applications.  For example, such coatings would eliminate the need for lubricants in high temperature, low heat loss diesel engines, leading to substantial reduction in particulate emissions.\r\n",
