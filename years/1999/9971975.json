Shimura's original conjecture was an\r\nextension of the Lefschetz fixed point theorem for holomorphic\r\nmaps and projective varieties, announced during the 1964 Summer\r\nInstitute in Algebraic Geometry at Woods Hole. Bott and Atiyah\r\nrealized that there should be a general formula for maps\r\npreserving any elliptic operator, or indeed any elliptic complex,\r\nand the theorem took shape. Their result and the index theorem\r\nunderpin the modern relationship between geometry, arithmetic,\r\nand physics. Raoul Bott will give an exposition of approaches for\r\nproving the theorem and generalizations that motivate current\r\nresearch. Other lectures will cover the development of\r\npseudodifferential operators in index theory, which made possible\r\na bridge between analysis and the geometry of the problem.\r\nExamples will include non-classical ones, like the Heisenberg\r\nalgebra of pseudodifferential operators on a contact\r\nmanifold. Atiyah-Singer formulas are obtained for certain\r\nFredholm operators, and also for a class of Fourier integral\r\noperators defined by homogeneous symplectic automorphisms of a\r\ncotangent bundle. Other lectures will explain the use of an\r\nelementary Morse theory to derive natural Morse functions on\r\nmoduli spaces, connections of the Atiyah-Bott theorem with\r\nphysics, and the application of Lefschetz formula methods to the\r\nHarish-Chandra theory of group representations.\r\n\r\nBefore this century there was no sharp line between physics and\r\nmathematics.  The divergence between the two fields accelerated,\r\nand by the 1950's there was little in common, though physicists\r\nhad become increasingly adept at using what mathematics was\r\nnecessary for their theories.  Since the 1970's there has been an\r\nextraordinary convergence of mathematics and physics in the basic\r\ntheories of space and matter.  The Atiyah-Bott fixed point\r\ntheorem, or Woods Hole theorem, is a landmark mathematical result\r\nfrom the 1960's. This theorem has led to a great number of\r\napplications to problems in mathematics, and is an active field\r\nof research. To consider the present work and the future\r\npossibilities suggested by the Atiyah-Bott theorem, a meeting is\r\nplanned for the fall of 1999, in celebration of this work and the\r\ncareer of Raoul Bott. The implications of this research on the\r\nproblems common to both physics and mathematics will be explored.\r\n",
