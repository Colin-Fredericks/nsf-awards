 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to complete the development of novel photocatalysts and reactor systems for an Adsorption-Integrated-Reaction (AIR) technology, providing a system to destroy volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in applications with high flow rates of air and dilute contaminant concentrations.  KSE, Inc. has developed novel photocatalyst formulations which are orders of magnitude more active than conventional titania photocatalysts.  The research will provide a new, multicomponent, zeolite-based photocatalytic adsorbent, which is a highly effective photocatalyst.  This research program will consist of synthesis of catalyst compositions, kinetic studies on representative classes of VOCs, reactor design studies, and a comparative cost analysis of the resulting photocatalytic technology.  The development of an effective dilute phase pollution control concept is expected, which will provide a cost-effective technology for destroying VOCs in high flow rate air with dilute VOC concentrations.\r\n     Commercial applications will include control of air pollution (a) by destruction of air emissions of VOCs from soil and groundwater remediation, (b) from industrial emissions, and (c ) for enhanced indoor air quality, for both government and the private sector.  The technology will reduce the costs of air pollution control, enhance environmental quality, and improve economic competitiveness.\r\n\r\n",
