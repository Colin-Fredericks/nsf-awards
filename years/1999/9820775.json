Classical and modern techniques of complex analysis will be applied to inductive limits of disk algebras generated by Blaschke products and inner functions, a special case of which is the algebra of generalized analytic functions, i.e., of functions on a compact abelian group with ordered dual that are analytic in a particular sense. Relationships between inductive limit algebras generated by one inner function and complex dynamical systems will be investigated. It appears that the ideas involved have great potential for further developments in the analysis on compact groups with ordered duals and for a host of topics: Wiener-Hopf operators, invariant subspaces of some function spaces, dynamical systems, commutative Banach algebra theory, analytic function theory, corona type problems, Bourgain algebras and Hankel type operators, stability under small perturbations.\r\n\r\nThis international cooperative research project is jointly funded by NSF's Division of Mathematical Sciences and Division of International Programs. Its objectives will be achieved through direct cooperative research between Thomas Tonev of the University of Montana in the U.S. and Dr. Suren Grigoryan of Kazan State University in Tatarstan, Russia. Work on the project will serve to internationalize an ongoing domestic research effort in the area of abstract harmonic analysis by linking it with a similar project and other related research activities in Russia. The research will draw on the intellectual resources of both sides, and the direct contacts will allow the project to proceed at an optimal rate. It is the theory of dynamical systems, through its connections to abstract harmonic analysis, that lies at the root of the proposed research. This area, which is developing very rapidly at present, has important applications to many physical problems. It is well-known, for instance, that most processes in the physical world have an almost-periodic rather than strictly periodic behavior. One of the triumphs in the theory of dynamical systems has been the creation of mathematical tools for studying almost-periodic phenomena. This explains the great interest in almost-periodic functions and their close relatives, generalized analytic functions, which are among the principal objects of investigation in this cooperative endeavor. A successful completion of this project would lead to new discoveries of at first primarily mathematical interest but with great future potential for application.\r\n",
