The symposium takes place at the University of Texas at Austin on October 25-27, 1999, and is part of the 36th annual technical Meeting of the Society of Engineering Science.  \r\nThe symposium presents an opportunity for materials scientists, engineers, physicists, and applied mathematicians to present their recent work, exchange ideas, and plan collaborative research.  The meeting offers a valuable experience for graduate students as it provides them an exposure to a much wider research framework than found in their individual research projects. \r\n%%%\r\nOver the past several years a large number of engineers and scientists in industry and academia have been focusing on a new set of materials-related problems at the nanoscale level.  Technological requirements for very small devices and micromachines together with substantial progress in materials science and computer hardware/software have opened new horizons in the study of materials at the nanoscale.  \r\n***\r\n",
