 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twombly\r\n9902242\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed research seeks to quantify male reproductive success in order to determine the timing of sex change in a species of slipper snail.  This species is hermaphroditic, first male then subsequently female.  Sex change is thought to have evolved to occur at the point in the life cycle when an individual can produce more offspring as a female than as a male.  Environmental factors greatly influence the number of offspring fathered by a male, rendering the assessment of their role critical to understanding the timing of sex change.  The effect of the environment on male reproductive success will be evaluated by varying the number of males competing for fertilizations in laboratory mating arrays.  Offspring produced will be subjected to paternity analysis and results of the paternity analysis will be used to estimate male reproductive success under variable environmental conditions.  Estimates of male reproductive success will ultimately be used to develop a quantitative model that predicts the timing of sex change in this species.   \r\n\r\nHermaphroditism as a life history strategy has evolved in many commercially important species (oysters) and their pests (slipper snails) as a way to achieve maximum lifetime reproductive success.  Current theory states that female reproductive success increases with size while extrinsic pressures mediate male reproductive success.  Optimally, males should change sex at a size where female reproductive gain exceeds male reproductive gain.  To date, no study has attempted to measure male reproductive success under diverse environmental conditions.  Understanding how environmental factors affect male reproductive success will significantly contribute to the existing theory on the evolution and timing of sex change.  Such theory can be directly applied in the shellfish industry where the conditions that favor maximum reproductive output can be manipulated to increase oyster harvest yields and control pest populations.\r\n",
