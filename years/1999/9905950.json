 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the historical, intellectual, philosophical and cultural frameworks that has led to a sustained and institutionalized interaction of science and technology that has become known as engineering science. The project will have three major objectives: (1) discovering the philosophies that helped to shape engineering science; (2) analyzing how the epistemological aspects of those philosophies led to a methodological framework that drew from both science and technology; (3) investigating how those philosophies were linked to an ideological framework which allowed for the integration of science and technology. In order to accomplish these three main objectives, the project will focus on the lives, technical accomplishments and cultural/philosophical backgrounds of eight of the leading figures in the creation of engineering science during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The eight individuals that will be the focus of the project are, John Smeaton, William John Macquorn Rankine, Gaspard Monge, C.-L.-M.H. Navier, Ferdinand Redtenbacher, Franz Reuleaux, Benjamin Franklin Isherwood, and Robert H. Thurston. This group is representative of the national, disciplinary and methodological diversity that contributed to the creation of engineering science. The project should provide new insights into the relationship between science and technology in such areas as industrial and economic development, public policy, and engineering education. Through a study of the epistemologies of various philosophies that influenced engineering science, the project should be able to determine what aspects of engineering science are dependent upon particular national/cultural frameworks and what aspects transcend those frameworks. Also, the project should provide a foundation for establishing a new dialogue between the history of science and the history of technology. Finally, the project will make a significant contribution to a major book on the history of the interactions between science and technology that is under contract to Oxford University Press.\r\n\r\n",
