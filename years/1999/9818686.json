 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of welfare benefit levels and premarital childbearing.  It examines the extent to which the relationship between welfare benefit levels and premarital childbearing depends upon social and economic context.  Contexts are defined to include normative climate (stigma associated with nonmarital childbearing, stigma associated with welfare receipt, positive role models in the community); the extent to which contraception and abortion are options for young women (availability, acceptability, and affordability); and economic opporotunties (through parents, potential husbands and employment).  To date, researchers have implicitly assumed that the relationship between welfare benefits and premarital childbearing is constant across contexts. The current study examines three categories of contextual factors that may condition the effect of welfare benefit levels on premarital childbearing.  The hypotheses are tested using longitudinal data from two sources: the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. These data are supplemented with information on context from the General Social Surveys, the Current Population Surveys, and the decennial Censuses.\r\n\r\nThis study will improve our understanding of ways in which social policy interacts with cultural and economic forces to alter the structure of the family in contemporary societies. It will also increase our understanding of the ways in which economic incentives influence young women's decisions about childbearing and marriage.\r\n",
