 "awd_abstract_narration": "9978181\r\nToohey \r\n\r\nThis research project will conduct a series of measurements in conjunction with the NASA mission SOLVE (SAGE Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment), to examine the issue of ozone loss due to halogen radicals in the arctic polar vortex. ClO, BrO, Cl2O2, CFC-11, particles, and ozone will be measured with fast-response in situ instruments between 10 and 30 km with small balloons to be launched from Kiruna, Sweden. Up to six launches will be scheduled from late November, 1999, through February, 2000, to address the following issues: \r\n\r\n. Flight 1 - Initial pre-PSC vortex composition, including particle, halogen radical, and ozone distributions,   and the impact of warm (~200-210 K) heterogeneous chemistry,\r\n.  Flight 2 - Early-winter reactive chlorine (ClO + Cl2O2) partitioning and ozone loss at high-solar zenith    angles, \r\n. Flights 3-6 - Halogen activation by PSCs, mid-winter ozone loss due to BrO and ClO, and halogen recovery.\r\n\r\nThe project will be conducted in close collaboration with investigators from France and Sweden who will be conducting separate balloon measurements of NO2, OClO, BrO, ozone, water vapor, CFC-11, and CFC-12, and ground-based measurements of a large suite of compounds, including columns of BrO, source gases, and reservoirs, and profiles of ClO. Launches will be scheduled to overlap with other SOLVE activities to enhance the science objectives. This will include validations of coincident SAGE III measurements, intercomparisons with similar measurements on the ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft, and opportunities for correlative flights with balloons measuring long-lived tracers and reservoirs of halogen and nitrogen oxides. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective will be to provide a unique data set with which to determine halogen activation and deactivation and ozone loss from the tropopause to ~30 km, and which can be used to suitably constrain models used to calculate ozone loss. This work will also complement activities outlined in the SOLVE NRA by providing high-resolution profiles that will extend the observations of similar species in time and vertical space (in the case of the ER-2 and DC-8) and by producing a more comprehensive set of measurements (in the case of large remote and in situ balloon payloads). \r\n\r\nThe campaign will be directed by an experimental team that includes the PI, Prof. Terry Deshler of the University of Wyoming, Dr. Neil Harris of the European Ozone Research Coordinating Unit, Dr. Jean-Pierre Pommereau of Service d'Aeronomie du CNRS, France, and Prof. Sheila Kirkwood of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics, Kiruna, Sweden. The final flight schedule will be developed with additional input from the SOLVE science team, and launches will be based primarily on meteorological forecasts from the Goddard Space Flight Center trajectory mailer with information from 3-D photochemical models. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
