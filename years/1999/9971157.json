This is the third in a series of international conferences on discrete and computational geometry going back to 1986.  Areas to be discussed include enumerative properties of arrangements, k-sets, geometric transversal theory, the complexity of Betti number computation, a new proof of the bellows conjecture, and the recently-announced proof of the Kepler conjecture, among many others.\r\n\r\nThe fields of discrete (or combinatorial) geometry and of computational geometry both deal with configurations of points, lines, planes, balls, polyhedra, etc. in 2- and 3-dimensional space, as well as in higher dimensions; i.e., with fundamental questions about simple (but usually many) geometric objects.  Discrete geometry seeks a basic understanding of such geometric structures, while computational geometry investigates the inherent complexity (difficulty) of algorithmic problems.  Many questions in applied areas can be reduced to problems about discrete configurations of many geometric objects.  Hence advances in mathematical understanding of the geometric structures and in computational methods for dealing with them can have significant consequences for applications.  Such applications arise, for example, in computer aided design and manufacturing, solid modeling, textile layout, medical imaging, computer vision, optimization, computer graphics and virtual reality, robot motion planning, geographic information systems, and molecular biology.\r\n\r\n",
