Poltoratski\r\n\r\nAbstract: Poltoratski's research will focus on a variety of questions related to the boundary behavior of Cauchy-Stieltjes integrals. The project consists of three parts. The first part concentrates on problems in complex function theory. Specifically, the PI plans to study the interaction between singular and nonsingular components of Cauchy integrals. The second part of the project is devoted to applications in quantum dynamics and  Anderson localization, some of the most interesting areas involving mathematical models of modern solid state physics. The objective of the third part of the project is to complement the well-developed theory of contractive operators in Hilbert spaces with a deeper understanding of the structure of so-called almost unitary operators.\r\n\r\nComplex function theory is one of the most classical parts of modern mathematics, yet at the same time is one of its most rapidly expanding and developing fields. The present stage of its development features many promising new applications to various areas of mathematics and physics. Among the cornerstones of complex function theory is the integral formula named after the famous French mathematician Augustin Cauchy. The importance of this formula lies in the fact that most analytic functions of one complex variable can be defined as or represented by Cauchy integrals. Poltoratski plans to study various properties of functions defined via Cauchy integrals near the boundaries of their domains, where the precise behavior of such functions is subtle and difficult to comprehend. The results will then be applied to several other central topics in mathematics, as well as to quantum dynamics. The application to quantum dynamics will deal with mathematical models of wave propagation. A conjecture made by the Nobel laureate P. Anderson about the behavior of waves in disordered media has made this an area of intensive research activity in recent years. Despite this flurry of activity, wave propagation in disordered media is not completely understood, especially in spacial dimensions greater than one. New information about this phenomenon could be highly relevant to a host of problems in physics and engineering.\r\n",
