 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Worcester Foundation/WUMMC Summer Training Program is a ten-week immersion in biological research for undergraduate students. It consists of intensive \"hands-on\" laboratory research experience individualized for each student and performed under the guidance of working scientists' expert in many of the modern areas of biological science. The Program is designed to provide students with their first exposure to the actual practice of scientific research in the hopes that the excitement, challenge and creativity of the enterprise will convince them to consider basic research in the sciences as a viable career choice. In the spring, each student is matched with a basic research project, initially proposed by a preceptor with an active research program in the students stated area of interest. Upon acceptance, each student is provided with a reading list of current publications in the selected area to provide the background required for the proposed summer research project. The program will: 1) instruct each student in safe laboratory, and appropriate ethical practice; 2) acquaint them with current issues in biology; 3) teach them scientific techniques and skills, many of which can be utilized in their future endeavors; 4) guide them in shaping the specific research questions to be asked; 5) require that they work independently toward the agreed upon research goals; 6) encourage cross disciplinary approaches by providing opportunities for interaction with other students, research staff, and visiting scientists; and 7) maintain an educational setting which is maximally challenging and thus, fosters each student's exploration of future career choices in science. In addition to the required written report detailing the progress made in their individual research projects, each student presents a report to the Faculty and public summarizing the results of their efforts at a closing poster session and award ceremony.",
