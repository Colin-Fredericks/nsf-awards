 "awd_abstract_narration": "9977922\r\n\r\nThe eukaryotic microbial mat at Nymph Creek in Yellowstone National Park is an ideal natural laboratory for a Microbial Observatory designed to increase our understanding of eukaryotic microbial genetic diversity, ecophysiology, and behavior.  The thermal (50 degrees C), acidic (pH 2.7) water near the stream's source creates stable environmental gradients in temperature, pH, and light over which changes in microbial populations will be monitored.  The mat's biocomplexity is limited near the stream's source but includes the red alga Cyanidium caldarium, the most thermophilic alga known, and the thermophilic, filamentous fungus Dactylaria constricta var. gallopava. As downstream pH and water flow increase and temperatures decline, a concomitant expansion of microbial species, including slime molds, protozoa, green algae, and diatoms, is expected. Two Nymph Creek sites, defined in terms of differing light, pH, and temperature, will be extensively monitored over diurnal and seasonal time periods. Contemporary analyses, including microscopic methods and rRNA sequencing, will be used to document microbial diversity and analyze the mat's microstructure at both sites. Changes in macro- and micro-scale environmental conditions in the bulk water and through the vertical aspect of the mats will be recorded.  Nucleic acid sequence-based techniques will be used to monitor microbial population changes in situ under environmental conditions that vary in space and time. Ribosomal RNA sequence-based technologies greatly facilitate the study of microbes in natural environments and provide a rational platform on which to base phylogeny. However, while these methods are used routinely to study uncultivated bacterial populations, the same approaches have not been rigorously applied to studies of eukaryotic microbial communities. As a result, the discovery of new eukaryotic species and an understanding of the diversity and ecophysiologies of eukaryotic microorganisms are largely restricted to descriptions of cultivated strains. It is clear that uncultivated eukaryotic microorganisms exist and their discovery may represent a vast untapped source of new microbial products. Therefore, an in-depth study, focused on the ecology of a eukaryotic microbial community, augmented by nucleic acid sequence-based methods of detection and classification, cannot fail to fundamentally advance current knowledge in this field. Information gained from this study will include descriptions of new species, novel strains in axenic culture, and measurements of genetic diversity and its relationship to the ecophysiologies of indigenous microorganisms.  Of particular interest is the interaction between C. caldarium and D. constricta, first described in the 1970's by Brock and his coworkers, who found that the alga and the fungus always cohabit.   However, they did not elaborate on this interaction, which could be  symbiotic, parasitic, or merely coincidental.  This pair of organisms may represent a primitive ancestor to modern-day lichens, which are usually composed of a filamentous fungus and a green alga.  In-depth studies will explore possible features of the D. constricta-C. caldarium association, including whether the alga provides nutrients for the fungus, whether the fungus parasitizes the alga, and whether the fungal hyphae provide a matrix that anchors the unicellular algae and stabilizes stream sediment. Melanin of fungal hyphae may also protect algae from the harmful effects of intense light. In addition, new genotypes of the fungus or alga detected by rRNA sequencing across environmental gradients will be cultured. The distributions of fungal and algal 18S rRNA genotypes will determine whether unique genotypes correlate with ecological niches.  Nymph Creek provides an accessible outdoor laboratory where microbes that form luxuriant  bright green microbial mats can be observed by researchers, students and the public. Knowledge from the Nymph Creek observatory will be shared via outreach and internet activities. These activities should increase public awareness and appreciation of microbial diversity, biochemical microbial activities, and their influences on ecosystems.",
