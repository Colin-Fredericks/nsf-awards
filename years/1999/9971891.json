This flow has been successful in\r\ntopologically classifying Riemannian manifolds satisfying\r\npositive curvature conditions. Hamilton's program for the Ricci\r\nflow on 3-dimensional manifolds is an approach to understanding\r\nThurston's Geometrization Conjecture, which subsumes the Poincare\r\nConjecture.  The main topics considered in the project include\r\nthe search for new Harnack inequalities for the Ricci flow,\r\nfurthering the geometric understanding of the existing Harnack\r\ninequalities, and investigations in the behavior of the Ricci\r\nflow for collapsing solutions. Harnack inequalities are\r\nfundamental to the area of partial differential equations and\r\nthey have been pioneered for parabolic equations in differential\r\ngeometry by the work of Li, Yau, and Hamilton.  Hamilton's matrix\r\nHarnack inequality is especially important in the analysis of\r\nsingularities that arise under the Ricci flow.  Understanding\r\nthese singularities has had a major impact on the study of other\r\nevolution equations such as the mean curvature flow, and depends\r\nupon tools such as a compactness theorem related to injectivity\r\nradius estimates.  We shall consider aspects of the Ricci flow in\r\nthe absence of such estimates, where solutions collapse.\r\n\r\nMany phenomena are modeled by evolutionary equations, such as the\r\ntransfer of heat and the evolution of interfaces between molten\r\nand solid forms of metal. The study of evolution equations in\r\ngeometry has grown tremendously in the last several years.  In\r\nmany cases geometric evolution equations deform an initial\r\ngeometric structure to an improved one, but in other cases the\r\nstructures develop singularities. It is of fundamental importance\r\nto analyze these singularities. Such a study has been carried out\r\nto a large extent for the Ricci flow, which is an evolution\r\nequation deforming geometric structures on manifolds, the locally\r\nEuclidean spaces arising in Einstein's Theory of Relativity and\r\nmost major branches of mathematics and theoretical physics.  For\r\nexample, space-time is a 4-dimensional manifold and the universe\r\nwe live in is a 3-dimensional manifold. It is widely believed by\r\nmathematicians that any 3-dimensional manifold may be decomposed\r\ninto pieces which admit canonical geometric structures.  Since\r\nthe Ricci flow deforms geometric structures, and all manifolds\r\nadmit geometric structures, it may be used as an approach to the\r\nabove question if it can be shown that the flow deforms geometric\r\nstructures to canonical geometric structures.\r\n",
