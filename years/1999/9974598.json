These four scientists plan to synthesize new biodegradable polyesters with advantageous functionalities, to make mechanical and physical characterization, and to describe and interpret their properties from a molecular point of view. They plan to address the problem in an integrated hierarchical approach to connect normally fragmented fields in the study, characterization and use of these biopolymers. \r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow a US scientist to collaborate with three scientists at three Turkish institutes.  The research area, the development of biodegradable polyesters, is of interest in the United States and in Turkey.  Polymers derived from biodegradable or renewable resources are of broad importance, and would have many applications.  In this project a group at the Marmara Research Center outside Istanbul will produce SCLPHAs `                     cross-linking for modifying the properties of the polyesters.  Two groups at Sabanci University and Koc University in Istanbul will participate with Dr. Cakmak at Akron in the characterization of the samples.  Their work will involve both theoretical and experimental techniques.  They will also participate in the processing of selected polymers. The P.I. and his collaborators have the complementary experience needed to do this research.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting US-foreign scientific collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.\r\n",
