 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to determine how children acquire new ideas (as opposed to facts or skills). The approach is to identify generic obstacles to learning, design a path around those obstacles, create a learning scenario--a set of linked situations, materials and activities--that supports that path and, finally, investigate what children learn in that scenario. One obstacle to learning is that the learner's main tool for interpreting new information is his or her prior knowledge, so new information tends to be distorted to be consistent with the latter. This obstacle can be overcome by learning an analogue to the target idea in some other domain and then transferring that idea to the target domain. A second generic obstacle is the cognitive strain associated with the need to coordinate multiple perspectives, a frequent task in science class. This obstacle can be overcome by engaging the learner in a dialogue that makes the relations between the multiple perspectives explicit. These two hypotheses are embedded in a scenario for teaching very young children that the Earth is round. Virtual reality technology is used to provide an unfamiliar context in which to acquire the concept of a spherical planet and physical models are used to support the application of that concept to the Earth. Two studies will be carried out in an economically and ethnically diverse school to assess whether this scenario is effective. The results will inform current debates in psychology about the function of prior knowledge, analogical transfer and multiple perspectives in learning and provide guidelines for the future use of virtual reality in science instruction. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
