 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Microsystems: \"XYZ on a Chip\" project will investigate the development and exploitation of a new, integrated circuit (IC) compatible microfabrication processing technology that has the potential to make profound changes and improvements in the way microfluidic devices are manufactured.  A vast array of microfluidic devices have been disclosed that could improve our way of life by impacting medical, environmental, and chemical technologies.  Examples include devices for combinatorial chemical synthesis, genetic diagnostics and micro-chemical analysis and sensing.  Although the principles of many of these devices have been demonstrated, their ultimate success will be determined by the ability to use inexpensive, standardized, mass fabrication processes to build the complex three-dimensional fluidic layers and to integrate the fluidic components with functional electrical devices.  The basis for this fabrication technology is the recent discovery that certain classes of polynorbomene materials can be thermally decomposed in-situ at moderate temperatures to form buried, micrometer-sized air-gap structures in microelectronic materials.  \r\n\r\nThe development of this technology, which can use conventional lithographic patterning techniques and be easily integrated with existing IC manufacturing processes, offers the possibility to form complex, multi-layer three-dimensional channel networks.  In order to exploit this discovery for IC compatible microchannel applications, it will be necessary to gain both a fundamental understanding of the materials and process parameters involved and to demonstrate the utility of this concept in engineering relevant Microsystems.  Devices integrating CMOS circuits, complex, multi-level capabilities, and chemically altered surfaces will be demonstrated.\r\n",
