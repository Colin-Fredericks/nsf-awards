Perverse sheaves are a part of algebraic\r\ntopology that is about twenty years old.  They have been applied with great\r\nsuccess to the study of complex algebraic singularities.  Perhaps the most\r\nnotable applications have been to spaces and stratifications related to\r\nalgebraic groups, yielding new insights in representation theory.  Over the\r\nnext two years, M. Grinberg will work on four research projects whose\r\ncommon goal is to develop the computational techniques of the subject.\r\nSpecifically, the focus is on computing microlocal invariants of sheaves\r\nand stratifications and on computing with nearby cycles sheaves, in the\r\npresence of symmetry.  The first problem is to understand the microlocal\r\ngeometry of the nilcone in a complex semisimple Lie algebra.  The second\r\nis to study the geometry of the enveloping semigroup of a semisimple group,\r\nrecently introduced by E. Vinberg.  The third project is to explore possible\r\napplications of quasi-conical symmetry to the microlocal study of\r\nstratifications.  The last project, joint with D. Kazhdan, is to study the\r\nspace of formal arcs of finite codimension in a singular variety.  The\r\ncommon theme throughout this work is to learn to extract the key topological\r\ninvariants of the singular spaces and maps that arise in the study of\r\nalgebraic groups, their representations, and invariants.\r\n     Loosely speaking, the theory of perverse sheaves is a systematic way\r\nto exploit the fact that, for a singular space defined over the complex\r\nnumbers, the real and the imaginary directions contribute to the topology\r\nin dual ways.  This theory is a part of algebraic topology: a branch of\r\nmathematics concerned with the properties of higher dimensional spaces\r\nthat are preserved under continuous deformations.  Most applications of\r\nalgebraic topology are based on the following key idea: to consider all\r\nobjects of a certain kind as points in a single ``configuration space''\r\n(sometimes called a ``parameter space'' or a ``phase space'').  For example,\r\nall possible states of a mechanical system, or all possible situations in an\r\neconomic game (e.g., an auction) may be viewed as points of an appropriate\r\nconfiguration space.  The topological properties of this space may then be\r\nused to determine qualitative properties of the associated objects, such as\r\nwhether the mechanical system will evolve towards a periodic motion, or\r\nwhether the players in a game have optimal strategies.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
