 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposed doctoral dissertation research project is to explore how intergenerational transfers of wealth affect racial and ethnic inequality in assets between and within the Black, White and Hispanic communities in contemporary American society. The study builds on theories of social stratification and hypothesizes that inheritance of material resources is an increasingly important factor which determines racial and ethnic disparity in (1) ownership and magnitude of assets; (2) income generated from assets; and (3) transfers of inter-vivos gifts to children. Analyzing data from two national surveys, and applying different models to each of the racial/ethnic groups, two age cohorts will be closely studied: 1) the elderly who were born before the depression, and have experienced a prominent expansion in property ownership in the post World War II era; and 2) the 'baby-boomers' who, as a result of economic and demographic changes, are the most likely to be affected by intergenerational transfers of unprecedented amount of financial resources.",
