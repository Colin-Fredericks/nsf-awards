In\r\nparticular, Hjorth's project addresses structural issues about the Borel\r\nequivalence relations in which every equivalence class is countable, and\r\norbit equivalence relations on Polish spaces arising from the continuous\r\nactions of Polish groups somewhat more complicated than the infinite\r\nsymmetric group.  In the first case, there is a poverty of techniques for\r\ndistinguishing the Borel cardinalities of the quotient spaces, and in the\r\nsecond, he would hope to extend the methods from model theory that have\r\nbeen so wildly successful in the case of the infinite symmetric group.\r\n     In a very rough sense, one might try to divide mathematics into the\r\npart that seeks to determine some quantity or equation and the part that\r\nseeks simply to understand some abstract class of mathematical objects.\r\nIn the former part one has many examples, ranging from areas of applied\r\nmathematics through to the recent proof of (the inequality comprising)\r\n``Fermat's last theorem.''  In the second part one has certain areas in\r\nabstract analysis (for instance, the classification of commutative C-star\r\nalgebras), or even certain parts of topology (the classification of two-\r\ndimensional manifolds), or algebra (for instance, perhaps, the Hecke\r\nalgebras, which played such an important part in Wiles's proof), and the\r\nvery abstract kinds of objects that can appear there.  Here the intention\r\nis that simply understanding these objects can lead to unforseeable advances.\r\nHjorth's project concerns this second kind of mathematics, and it might be\r\nloosely described as concerned with which kinds of objects from one\r\nmathematical specialty can in principle be reduced to which other kinds of\r\nobjects from other subspecialties.\r\n***\r\n",
