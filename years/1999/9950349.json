 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proof-of-concept project for a collaborative effort to develop innovative web-based modules for an undergraduate developmental mathematics course.  The goal is to improve the quality of mathematics education by creating engaging, effective online course modules tailored to the needs of both students and educators. The Affinity Learning in Mathematics modules, designed for use in any computer-based learning environment with Internet access, will deliver high-quality, cost-effective mathematics instruction that is easily integrated into other disciplines, incorporates multi-disciplinary skills and perspectives, and is accessible to all students.\r\n\r\nThis project will produce a sample module for a developmental course in algebra-based mathematical modeling. If this project is successful then seven additional modules will be developed for the complete course.  A developmental mathematics sequence was chosen because it offers an innately assessable discipline driven by a significant need. Although the primary focus is developmental mathematics instruction, the modules will be easily customized to satisfy the curricular requirements of students majoring in education, liberal arts and math. The modules can stand alone or be easily integrated into existing courses. A prototype system of embedded assessment that will be widely applicable to other modules, courses, and disciplines is a critical component of the proposed effort.\r\n\r\nWhile Affinity Learning in Mathematics uses new and emerging technology, its primary innovation is the melding of educator, student and technology. The module instruction will be an interactive process, using appropriate technology to free the educator to become a cognitive coach. The research effort is expected to produce modules differing from and improving upon currently available computer- and web-based learning material in three key areas: adaptive technology, instructional design and assessment.\r\n\r\nAffinity Learning in Mathematics is the first phase of Project Socrates, a collaborative effort to drive fundamental changes in the way online education is presented. The modules proposed here will serve as a prototype for a flexible, scalable, adaptive learning system that can be applied in any discipline. The system will:  continually profile the student according to competence level, learning style, and background knowledge through a method combining personalized assessment and appropriate technology;  automatically structure material in modules that deliver learning activities, background material, enrichment resources, and peer/educator interaction in an environment tailored to individual needs; and create forums where the knowledge repository can evolve by incorporating on-line communities of learning peers, experts and mentors, so the knowledge grows with each user.\r\n\r\n",
