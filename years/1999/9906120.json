It is part of a larger research effort to understand the relation between poverty and ethnicity in this region.   The larger project includes a nationally representative survey fielded in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Slovakia.  The survey is designed to provide estimates of the extent of poverty, and also to assess whether certain ethnic groups, and in particular, the Roma (Gypsies), are likely to be concentrated in poverty.  Many researchers suspect that an underclass is forming among the Roma in this region as a result of the recent transition to a market economy.  Although a survey is crucial, it reveals little about the temporal processes that create an underclass or that produce waves of assimilation and dissimilation\r\n\r\nThis project, the historical component of the research, addresses this omission by studying the long-term processes of underclass formation, assimilation and dissimilation by linking them to economic systems of capitalism and socialism and to assimilationist policies.  Specifically, this project complements the quantitative (survey) methodology with community studies, using in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical, archival research.   This research will contribute to the sociological literature on the underclass and assimilation through its examination of these theoretical constructs outside the American context in which they are usually studied.  Research on the underclass in usually linked to African-Americans living in urban ghettos.  In contrast, this project considers whether an underclass exists among rural Roma in Central Europe.  Similarly, much research on assimilation focuses on the unidirectional process of immigrant assimilation in the United States.  Again, in contrast, this current project considers the waves of assimilation and dissimilation of non-immigrant ethnic minorities in a cross-national context.    \r\n\r\n",
