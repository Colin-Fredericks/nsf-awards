 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to study the following problems in\r\ncommutative algebra: 1) The Canonical Element Conjecture  of Hochster,\r\n2) Serr's Conjecture on Intersection Multiplicity and the Chow group problem,\r\n3) the study of asymptotic behavior of homologies in positive characteristic and\r\n4) the Strong Intersection Conjecture due to Peskine and Szpiro. Each of these is\r\na longstanding open problem and occupies a central position in the areas of\r\ncommutative algebra and algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nCommutative algebra and algebraic geometry may be thought of \r\nas studying solutions of many equations in many unknowns \r\nwhen, typically, the solution is not unique. The set of \r\nsolutions can then be viewed geometrically, but one \r\ncan use instead encode all the pertinent information about \r\nthe equations in abstract algebraic objects called commutative \r\nrings. The two points of view interact in beautiful and \r\nproductive ways. A breakthrough method in commutative algebra that \r\nhas had explosive development in this decade is the theory of tight \r\nclosure. Part of the underlying idea is to consider the system \r\nof equations, after sutiable modification, or the ring, modulo \r\nmany different prime integers. This is a powerful technique \r\nthat has solved many problems, while opening up vast new \r\nareas for research.\r\n",
