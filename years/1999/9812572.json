 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central problem of advanced computational science is making large data\r\nsets and the results of large simulations understandable by scientists and\r\nengineers. The best-known means of imparting this understanding is\r\nvisualization, which allows users to see the data. However, the complexity\r\nand nature of some data makes it appropriate to represent using the other\r\nsenses. For example, shape can be determined by touch. This project studies\r\nmultisensory virtual environments for large--scale complex scientific\r\ncomputing problems. To better focus the research efforts and validate the\r\nresults, it uses multimodal interaction with complex big-molecular datasets\r\nas the driving application. It aims to devise techniques and tools for\r\nmeaningful interactions with very large biomolecular data sets in virtual\r\nenvironments with visual, aural, and haptic (force) feedback. Most\r\nbiomolecular datasets consist of a few primitives (such as atom types, ammo\r\nacid sidechains, and nucleic acid bases) that are combined to yield rich\r\nmosaics of biological complexity. The researchers believe this is rich\r\nenough to be representative of other scientific visualization\r\nsub-disciplines and yet specialized enough to offer a well-defined research\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nThe research includes multimodal feedback using perception-dependent\r\nmultiresolution rendering on sequential and parallel architectures. The\r\nproposed advances optimize the multimodal rendering processes using a set\r\nof three characteristics common across most biomolecular datasets - limited\r\nmotif complexity, bounded accuracy, and variable level of perceptible\r\ndetail. Most scientific visualization datasets share at least two of these\r\ncharacteristics and therefore advances here should further the cutting-edge\r\nresearch in other areas of virtual-reality-assisted scientific computing.\r\nHere, the researchers will use hierarchical pre-rendered representations of\r\ncommon motifs to allow realism at interactive speeds in multimodal\r\ncontexts. They will also take advantage of processor support for variable\r\nresolution integer arithmetic and the limited dynamic range and bounded\r\ninput accuracy of biomolecular data to transparently speed up multimodal\r\nrendering by trading computational accuracy for speed. Finally, they will\r\ntake advantage of the fact that people's senses have thresholds of the\r\nleast perceptible stimuli, and that they typically perceive high details in\r\nonly a limited region, to explore techniques to address variable\r\nlevel-of-detail renderings in an integrated and coherent framework across\r\nmultiple senses. The researchers will validate the efficacy of proposed\r\napproaches on real-life datasets through a collaboration with two on-campus\r\nbiochemistry researchers working on protein folding and rational drug\r\ndesign and other visiting scientists and scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
