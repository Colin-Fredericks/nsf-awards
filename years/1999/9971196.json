Past research focused on periodic\r\norbits of the Reeb vectorfield, while this project deals with a\r\ndifferent class of trajectories, the so-called characteristic\r\nchords. These are orbits of the Reeb vectorfield that hit a given\r\nLegendrian knot twice at two different times (or more general, a\r\ngiven Legendrian submanifold). In the case of periodic orbits the\r\nmain tools were pseudoholomorphic curves in the symplectisation\r\nof the contact manifold with domain being a punctured Riemann\r\nsurface without boundary, while in the case of characteristic\r\nchords the domain will have boundary and also punctures on the\r\nboundary. A free boundary condition will be imposed. One aim of\r\nthis project is to investigate when characteristic chords exist,\r\na question which is related to a conjecture of V.I. Arnold in\r\ncontact geometry. The method developed by the principal\r\ninvestigator is a new version of a classical result by E. Bishop\r\nabout local fillings of a real surface near an isolated elliptic\r\ncomplex tangency.  The other aspect of the research project is\r\njoint work with Helmut Hofer which is providing the analytic\r\nsetting for a new invariant of Legendrian knots (\"Contact\r\nHomology\") in a three dimensional contact manifold, where\r\npseudoholomorphic curves on punctured Riemann surfaces play the\r\nkey role. This would also provide a more systematic approach to\r\nthe existence question for characteristic chords, since existence\r\nresults would imply nontriviality for the invariants in certain\r\ncases. Approaching the existence question of characterictic\r\nchords by filling methods is only possible if the contact\r\nmanifold is three dimensional while the construction of Contact\r\nHomology should also work in higher dimensions where very little\r\nis known about the dynamics of the Reeb vectorfield.  On the\r\nother hand, every closed three dimensional manifold admits a\r\ncontact form, with between dynamics and topology closely related.\r\n\r\nThis research project deals with the theory of Legendrian knots\r\nand dynamical systems induced by a Reeb vectorfield.  In recent\r\nyears close relationships have been found between knot theory and\r\nquantum field theory, a part of modern theoretical physics.\r\nDynamical systems of Reeb type describe a very diverse spectrum\r\nof phenomena in physics, such as the motion of a satellite in the\r\npresence of gravitational forces, or the motion of the particles\r\nof an ideal incompressible fluid if the motion is in an\r\nequilibrium (steady) state and the pressure is almost constant.\r\n",
