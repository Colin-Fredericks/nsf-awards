The proposal revolves about two broad goals:  (1) A precise understanding of what determines the wavelength of Trp fluorescence. The hypothesis (novel as applied to Trp) that the spectral maximum is determined almost entirely by an internal Stark effect, i.e., by the local electric field working against the charge transfer accompanying the ground to 1La transition will be tested. It is argued that this effect includes solvation and \"exciplex\" formation in addition to fields from the protein; (2) An understanding of the spectral shapes of the 1La and 1Lb transitions under various conditions (broadening) will to be established semiempirically with the aid of vibronically resolved spectra (some already in hand) and ab initio excited state calculations. It will be shown how such information may be used to clarify the underlying reasons for nonexponential fluorescence decay. Credibility of the (partially established) internal Stark effect model will be tested by comparing predictions from hybrid quantum chemical-molecular mechanics modeling of increasing quality for proteins with known structure with experimental fluorescence wavelengths. Of top priority experimentally are careful measurements of fluorescence spectra as a function of pH and comparison of mutants that differ by a single charged amino acid. Such measurements are expected to give direct insight into the controversial effective interior dielectric of proteins and the effect of external solvent on screening of charged groups with the protein. In particular, a number of charged groups in the models by themselves create predicted shifts of 30 nm (a field of about 3 x 107 V/cm). At least some of these are titratable histidines, aspartates, or glutamates. Some of these, as well as certain lysines and arginines appear to be in locations where they might be mutated without changing the protein structure significantly. Aspects of the model to be explored are the impact of the number of waters, the length of time of trajectory, the quantum mechanical model, the effective dielectric constant (or inclusion of atomic polarizability), and the empirical force field used. A few remaining experiments on model indoles under cold jet and cold crystalline matrix conditions will complete the data base for establishing accurate theoretical band shapes. More accurate ab initio calculations on these models are also proposed. The significance and value of this work stem from the current absence of an accurate, widely embraced view of the fundamental principles underlying fluorescence from this important intrinsic chromophore, and an unique viewpoint at a basic level of experiment and theory is desired. Structural information tends to be of higher quality for Trp than for extrinsic probes, which is why it is worthwhile to clear up the objections to Trp over certain extrinsic probes. If the electrostatic model proves accurate, Trp fluorescence wavelengths will provide excellent tests for the important task of accurately predicting electrostatic fields and potentials in proteins. If detailed knowledge of the band shapes leads to an understanding of the causes for nonexponential decay, a large amount of good lifetime data will become more valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this study is to use computer modeling and theory to reliably predict the wavelengths emitted by the amino acid tryptophan during UV irradiation. Tryptophan fluorescence wavelengths and relative intensities are widely used by biological scientists as an indicator of the nature of the protein interior near the tryptophan, and to monitor rapid changes in a protein, such as folding and unfolding. Such information provides an essential complement to the primarly structure methods, x-ray crystallography and NMR, for fleshing out important details. For example, the position of a key lysine in the protein thioredoxin is still uncertain, despite the existence of excellent x-ray and NMR structures. This work centers on testing the hypothesis that tryptophan fluorescence wavelengths are determined by the electric field strength and direction caused by the protein and solvent. Initial results are very promising, and more detailed calculations and experiments centered around changing the charges by changing pH are planned. The significance of this work lies in the importance of electrostatic effects in the functioning of the myriad proteins that mediate life processes. Electrostatic energies and forces have been notoriously difficult to predict for proteins, and for that reason the ability to use electrostatics to predict fluorescence wavelengths would be an important milestone.\r\n",
