Many of the differences between species are adaptive and reflect the historical action of natural selection molding populations to different environments.  However, it is not clear that positive selection is the principal factor maintaining genetic variation within species.  Intra-species variation may be caused by deleterious mutations, genetic changes that reduce the survival or reproductive success of the organism.  The proposed research tests several predictions of the Deleterious Mutation Model (DMM) by measuring how the genetic composition of a population changes as a result of artificial selection.  Selection will be imposed on flower size of Mimulus guttatus, a model plant species for genetic studies.  A range of analyses applied to the resulting data will provide an incisive test of the DMM.\r\n\r\nThe nature of genetic variation in plant reproductive characters is a central concern for both the evolution of natural populations and the improvement of agricultural plants.  If genetic variation in an agriculturally important trait is caused by deleterious mutations, then selection for that trait is likely to have detrimental side effects.  A high yielding strain may inevitably be more susceptible to disease or adverse conditions.  If genetic variation is not caused by deleterious mutations however, selection regimes can be developed that produce high yielding plants without negative side effects.\r\n\r\n",
