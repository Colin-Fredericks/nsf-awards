Hall\r\nAerospace and Ocean Engineering\r\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute and State University\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nThe principal goal of this research is to develop a complete understanding of the dynamics and control of momentum exchange in spacecraft. While these problems have received significant attention in the literature, many of the results have been developed for linearized equations of motion. Recent global analysis of nonlinear equations of motion has led to significant new results, and suggests new lines of research for previously intractable problems. \r\n\r\nThe equations of motion describing these systems are expressed in noncanonical Hamiltonian form, with several perturbing torques considered. One objective is to characterize completely the relative equilibrium motions of spacecraft with internal energy dissipation, with special attention to those asymptotically stable equilibria corresponding to a stationary platform. This will be applied to the nonlinear control of rotational maneuvers, including optimal control maneuvers and sub-optimal stationary-platform maneuvers. Stationary-platform maneuvers are based on a simple feedback law, and have the useful property that the platform angular velocities remain small throughout any maneuver.\r\n\r\nGlobal analysis of other problems, such as escape from resonance trap states, resonance capture avoidance, dual-spin turn, and flat spin recovery will complete the basic understanding of momentum exchange in gyrostats.  This will require extensions of standard tools in perturbation and bifurcation theory, and will yield results with definite applications to spacecraft design. Additional investigations will analyze the effects of various realistic perturbations, where improved understanding will lead to improved designs of attitude control systems.\r\n\r\nA unique element of the research is the investigation of the historical development of momentum exchange in spacecraft. We will characterize the relationship between the academic developments as reported in research literature and the developments that have taken place in the satellite industry. This effort will identify the critical events in the development of this technology, including both elegant mathematical results and catastrophic attitude control system failures. \r\n \r\n",
