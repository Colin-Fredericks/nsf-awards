Yet much of this \"natural capital\" is unpriced, and therefore frequently undervalued, leading to its use or degradation in excess of that which would best serve the public good. Methods for proper valuation of these services are needed, together with an increased understanding of the biogeophysical factors that form their bases. Natural and social scientists have been collaborating on these questions from over a decade, but these collaborations have been isolated and limited. At present there is no common understanding among scholars as to the most important unanswered questions or most fruitful directions for future research. This interdisciplinary workshop will assess the current literature on natural capital and its valuation and identify the most crucial gaps in that literature. This assessment is intended to serve as the basis for a larger effort in 2000 that will produce a comprehensive research agenda for the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
