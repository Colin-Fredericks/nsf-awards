 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research supported by this grant focuses on the development of a comprehensive geometric modeling paradigm for designing Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). The new geometric modeling scheme for MEMS will address the issues of unusual aspect ratios; multiple layers; heterogenous material composition; and geometric intricacies brought about by photolithography, conformal and other depositions, and isotropic and anisotropic etches. The art-to-part problem, that is, building accurate physical models using the artwork of photolithography masks and the process information, will be addressed first. Accurate physical models that truly represent the microfabricated devices are useful in performing the computational behavioral simulations. The part-to-art problem, i.e., generating the masks from the 3-D model for a given process, will be addressed next. The geometric modeling framework to be developed in this work will employ a constitutive element representation and suitable image processing algorithms to naturally mimic the deposition and etching processes. The set-theoretic basis of erosion and dilation will be used to solve the art-to-part and the part-to-art problems. By a proper selection of constitutive elements and structuring elements, several types of crystal orientations, etches and deposits will be simulated. The design rules for validating an already created 3-dimensional model, and generative rules to aid the MEMS designer to create an object for a chosen process will also be developed in the new geometric modeling framework. Microfabricated test structures will be utilized to validate the algorithms developed in this work.\r\n     The process of creating an accurate model from the masks will be a notable addition to the emerging computer-aided design tools for MEMS and will favorably impact the MEMS industry. The part-to-art problem, if successfully solved, will significantly change the way MEMS devices are designed. Then, MEMS designers will no longer need to start from manufacturing information (masks), but instead can focus on directly creating the solid model using behavioral simulations. The generative rules will expedite the MEMS design process and will lead to better visualization without having to know the minute details of microfabrication processes.\r\n",
