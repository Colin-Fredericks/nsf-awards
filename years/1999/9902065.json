 "awd_abstract_narration": "9902065\r\nAugspurger\r\nThis dissertation research will test a new conceptual model explaining how river bend migration of high-energy rivers influences primary succession of riparian forests with high species richness. Whereas the traditional model of riparian forest succession describes a single pathway of succession, the proposed model predicts multiple pathways of succession promoted by predictable geomorphic processes related to the shape of the river channel. Specific objectives of this research include (1) a field experiment to test the relative importance of elevation, soil texture, light, inundation, and/or physical flood damage in determining where tree species become established on new land forms, (2) a field experiment to determine the importance of depth to water table on emergence and survival of several common floodplain tree species, and (3) determining the generality of the proposed model of succession among rivers in the southeastern Coastal Plain. Confirmation of the proposed conceptual model of primary succession will refine our understanding of heterogeneity of forest structure by revealing important links between predictable geomorphic processes and pathways of primary succession. This understanding will contribute to the wise management of southeastern rivers with the purpose of maintaining natural habitat diversity. The proposed research is unique in its experimental investigation of small-scale physical processes that influence landscape-scale patterns of riparian vegetation and will serve as a model for future studies in landscape ecology.\r\n",
