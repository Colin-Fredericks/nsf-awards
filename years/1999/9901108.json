Jennings \r\nInstitution:  Case Western Reserve University \r\n\"Mechanism-Based Analysis for Electrokinetically-Enhanced Aggregate Remediation\" \r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough electrokinetic processes have been used in Geotechnical applications for many years, their use in remediation is relatively new.  Electrokinetics can be used to induce fluid flow, induce ion migration without fluid flow, or induce particle migration.  There are at least two situations where electrokinetic remediation can offer advantages over alternative strategies.  Electromobility may enhance the remediation of \"old contamination\" soils (soils that have been contaminated for decades) because these soils offer unusual resistance to mass transfer from the solid phase.  Electro-osmosis may have advantages in remediating low permeability soil where site hydrology precludes inducing flow hydraulically.   \r\n\r\nThis research project will study the individual processes that occur during electrokinetic remediation.  Experimental research will focus on this separation of electrochemical phenomena, and will quantify the individual mechanisms responsible for electrokinetically-enhanced remediation of \"old contamination\"  soils.  Mathematical modeling results and experimental analyses will be used to develop techniques to measure the parameters required for practical remediation design.  Screening methods will be devised to help engineers and scientists identify soils for which this remediation process would be most effective.  Results will be combined into a design tool that will help engineers analyze the potential benefits of applying electrokinetic processes to enhance remediation. \r\n  \r\nThe research will make contributions to both the fundamental understanding of electrokinetically-enhanced remediation, and the application of this knowledge to practical remediation design.  The methods and procedures developed will allow engineers to determine when electrokinetic phenomena offer competitive advantages over remediation alternatives. \r\n",
