 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972587\r\nRedepenning\r\n\r\nCeramic coated metal bone implants are one of the largest applications of bioceramics.  They are used primarily in hip and knee implants. Previous work from the PI's laboratory has shown that that strongly adherent calcium phosphate coatings can be produced using a simple electrolytic procedure. In this procedure the implant to be coated is used as the cathode in an electrolytic cell. Reductions at the cathode produce a pH increase that is localized near the electrode surface. The pH increase is used to precipitate desired calcium phosphate materials on the surface of the implant.  This procedure exhibits several advantages over existing technology. The electrolytic non-line-of-sight procedure can be used to uniformly coat irregularly shaped objects while maintaining control over deposit crystallinity.  Additionally, the technology required to perform the depositions is quite inexpensive. In this project, the parameters which produce chemically stable, physically robust hydroxyapatite coatings on metallic prostheses will be studied.  Adjustable deposition parameters include current density, voltage, and composition and pH of the electrolyte.  Additionally, the use of ultrasonically agitated baths will be investigated to improve adhesion of the resulting ceramic films.  Thermal sintering will also be examined as a means of improving adhesion.  Chemical characterization of the coatings will include reflectance infrared spectroscopies, solid state NMR, x-ray diffraction, and atomic absorption spectroscopy.  Macroscopic morphology will be monitored using scanning electron microscopy.  Profilometry, tensile testing, and shear testing will be conducted in collaboration with Spire Corporation, Bedford, MA.\r\n%%%\r\nCeramic coatings for bone implants are an important application of bioceramics.  Current deposition techniques are line-of-sight and thus cannot be used on complicated implant shapes.  The research performed on this grant will provide engineers with a deposition technique that can be used on complicated shapes, thus providing a great benefit to society.\t\r\n***  \r\n",
