 "awd_abstract_narration": "9975708\r\nDillingham\r\n\r\nThis grant will provide partial support for the acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and an associated closed cycle helium cryostat.  The FTIR spectrometer will be integrated with our existing x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy system, providing multi-technique materials analysis capability.  This instrumentation will be used in a multi-disciplinary research program involving faculty and undergraduate student researchers in condensed matter/surface physics, astrophysics, planetary astronomy, and chemistry.  The main focus of the current research program is investigation of the chemical and material properties of ices (the term \"ice\" as used in this context refers to the solid phase of materials typically thought of as either liquids or gases).  The addition of the helium cryostat will greatly expand our capability for growing these low temperature materials.  The FTIR spectrometer will also be utilized in an educational capacity.  In addition to training our undergraduate research students in its operation, the instrument will be used by students in several advanced undergraduate laboratories.\r\n\r\nNorthern Arizona University has a strong commitment to undergraduate education and has a primary focus on faculty teaching.  The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers undergraduate degree programs in physics, astronomy, and physical science, and in teacher preparation in physics and physical science.  The Department is committed to the development of its research program that will benefit both faculty scholars and the undergraduate students that they serve.  Furthermore, the University mission statement places a particular emphasis on the education of Native Americans.  NAU has one of the largest Native American student populations of all U. S. Colleges.  The Department of Physics and Astronomy has established a long history of providing opportunities for these students to fully participate in research projects and work closely with individual professors.  Thus, the instrumentation requested in this proposal will advance this mission through its support of the research-based programs already in place.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is an ideal, integrative research education acquisition, that is expected to significantly impact Native American students.\r\n***\r\n",
