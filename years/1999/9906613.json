 "awd_abstract_narration": "9906613\r\nArgon\r\n\r\nThe important role of grain boundaries in polycrystalline steel in suppressing the brittle-to-ductile (B-D) transition temperature by promoting plastic relaxation processes is well documented.  However, the actual forms of this beneficial interaction are inadequately understood.  In recent fundamental experimental and theoretical considerations of thermally initiated B-D transition in the propagation of cleavage cracks, it is clear that repeated mechanical arrest of such cracks by grain boundaries promotes plastic relaxations that have distinct beneficial effects in suppressing the B-D transition temperatures.  Accordingly, a comprehensive research program is planned involving the experimental measurement of the fracture resistance of a broad selection of individual grain boundaries in large bi-crystals of a Fe-3% Si alloy, harvested from a large ingot containing a range of grain sizes.  Additional experimental research examines the thermally stimulated B-D fracture transitions in Fe-3% Si single crystals to develop a clear understanding of the dislocation mechanisms governing the transition.  Complementary experiments are planned on the topological features of cleavage fracturing through finer-grained polycrystalline panels.  These measurements of boundary cracking resistance and other noted aspects of percolation of cleavage fracture through a field of grains are incorporated into models of global cleavage cracking resistance.  The models should have immediate applicability in engineering practice for dealing with the B-D transition not only in the lower shelf region but also in the upper shelf region.\r\n%%%\r\nTransitions in fracture mode from brittle cleavage to ductile forms, or vice versa, in intrinsically brittle crystalline solids, particularly steels, is a phenomenon of both basic scientific interest and immense technological importance in assuring safety in structures.\r\n***\r\n",
