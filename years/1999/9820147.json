The students work on projects involving multithreaded systems including work in performance measurement and evaluation, tuning of multithreaded systems and clusters of shared memory multiprocessors.  Students for the program are recruited nationwide, but the program focuses on students from institutions lacking research facilities in the Southeastern United States including several institutions with significant populations of underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nEach REU participant is paired with one of the PIs or a post-doctoral research associate, and a graduate student working on the same project.  Educational activities include an organized 3-semester hour course on multithreading.  During their participation, the students are involved in literature search, writing critical reviews of technical papers, technical writing and oral presentations of their research.\r\n\r\n",
