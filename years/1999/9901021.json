The project involves building the equipment, testing its feasibility and preliminarily assessing its performance on various speech materials. If, as we believe to be the case, it is indeed possible to make such measurements reliably and meaningfully, such a result would have important implications for linguistics and related fields. It bears on the classical notion of 'articultory ease '.\r\n\r\nThe present project will evaluate two different solutions to the measuring of speech energy costs. Our first approach is similar to the technique traditionally used by experimental biologists in the study of whole body movements. It involves the use of an air flow meter and an oxygen concentration analyzer to derive the amount of O2 used during the speech task. The other method is expected to provide higher resolution. It works by freezing the outgoing breath stream at four different temperatures to successively extract water, carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen. By comparing the amounts obtained for speech and for rest over a certain time period, significant readings should be possible. Our goal is to assess the limitations and merits of these two techniques and to obtain preliminary information on the feasibility and precision of various experimental protocols.\r\n\r\n",
