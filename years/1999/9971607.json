Specifically, the principal investigators propose to study: diffeomorphism groups of manifolds; spaces of knots and links; the automorphism group and outer automorphism group of a free group; Whitehead algorithms for groups; the space of phylogenetic trees; Markov chains associated to hyperplane arrangements, Coxeter groups, and buildings; the topology at infinity of Artin groups; and graphs of generating sets of finite groups.  \r\n\r\nA unifying theme of this research is that of trying to understand abstract, algebraic constructions by relating them to concrete, geometric objects, somewhat as a sequence of abstract operations may be realized as a set of elementary manipulations of a Rubik's cube. The geometric objects in question are often very simple and natural, and can sometimes serve as mathematical models for phenomena in other scientific fields. For example, geometry and algebra have led to new results about Markov chains, which are used for simulations in many areas of science and applied mathematics. In addition, geometric insights often lead to the discovery of new relations between a priori unrelated concepts.  \r\n",
