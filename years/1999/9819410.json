One goal of this five-year program is to create 50 ISI-school partnerships around the nation.  The 50 teams (of 3 individuals each) will receive 70 hours of professional development in one year, followed by 31 hours of technical support the next year.  Each institute will provide instruction in the National Science Education Standards, inquiry-based learning, authentic assessments, key life science concepts, and the integration of ISI exhibits and collections into school life sciences curricula.  The trained Science Advisory teams will then perform their own training workshops, ultimately training over 2,500 teachers.  Other ISI's have agreed to participate, including the Brookfield Zoo (Chicago), the San Diego Zoo, and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (Pittsburgh).\r\n\r\n",
