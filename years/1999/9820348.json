The students work on projects involving process automation and device/circuit designs including work in robotics, image processing, and micro-electronic circuits.  The institution has strong cooperative plans with Bethune-Cookman College and also with Lucent and Harris corporations.  Students for the REU program are recruited nationwide, but the program focuses on students from the University of Central Florida, Bethune-Cookman College and nearby community colleges.  The REU students spend a part of their time at an industrial company, or at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, or in some cases at another nearby college.  The students are advised and reviewed by a team consisting of PIs, internal specialists, and outside experts.\r\n",
