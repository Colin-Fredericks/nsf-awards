 "awd_abstract_narration": "El-Shall is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the kinetics and mechanisms of gas phase and cluster polymerization, with the goals of understanding elementary ionic polymerization systems relevant to basic and applied polymer science.  Research objectives include the characterization of initiation, reactivities, and temperature-dependent kinetics of cationic copolymerization, structure determination of oligomers and cyclization products, elucidation of solvent effects, and investigations of metal-catalyzed polymerization.  A gas phase ion chromatography (IC) instrument will be constructed and used to perform the kinetic and equilibrium thermochemistry measurements.  The outcomes from these studies are expected to find applications that promote direct technological gains in the development of gas phase polymerization.\r\n\r\nThe synthesis of polymers using solvent-free methods eliminates the need for distillation, drying, and solvent recovery. This means that operating costs associated with polymeric material production could be reduced in some industrial applications.  As well, gas phase polymerization approaches can be used to produce defect-free uniform thin polymer films of controlled morphology and composition.  Such materials could have technological applications as protective coatings and electrical insulators.  This research project provides unique education and training opportunities for a diverse group of students at Virginia Commonwealth University. \r\n",
