 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will focus on several\r\nrepresentative problems connected with partial differential\r\nequations arising in wave propagation and fluid mechanics.\r\nIn recent years there has been a significant progress on \r\nthe study of qualitative behavior of solution to nonlinear\r\ndispersive models. The relation between dispersive and nonlinear effects \r\nhas motivated several remarkable works. As a consequence our understanding\r\nof several phenomena in nature is now more complete.\r\nHowever, several essential question remain open. \r\nFor example, an existence theory (local and global) for the Cauchy \r\nproblem for several systems of Schr\\\"odinger type arising in both \r\nmathematics and physics is unavailable. This is due to the fact that \r\nclassical methods can not be applied. Thus one has to develop other approachs \r\nwhich rely heavily on techniques and ideas in harmonic analysis. In collaboration \r\nwith C. E. Kenig and L. Vega, the principal investigator plans to \r\ncontinue the development of Fourier Analysis for this fundamental area of nonlinear PDE's.\r\n \r\n The wave propagation in diverse mediums and the interaction of \r\ndifferent kind of waves can be modeled by complicated systems of \r\npartial differential equations. These systems involve many variables\r\nwhich depends of the particular physical setting of the problem. In many cases,\r\nthese systems are too complicated to be treated with reasonable accuracy,\r\nthus one has to consider approximated models. The vality of these approximations \r\nis essential to further study of the physical phenomenon. One has to give \r\nprecise conditions under which the qualitative behavior of the solution of\r\nthese approximated models captures the features of the physical setting. \r\nIt is here where the theoretical study of these solutions become essential. \r\nThus, one starts with special solutions and its properties, stability, long time behavior\r\n, ill posedness, etc. In situations where these theoretical results are unavailable one \r\nneeds to start the study with some numerical simulations\r\n",
