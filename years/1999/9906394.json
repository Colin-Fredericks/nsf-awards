 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SMART GRE Prep Course was developed through HRD-9631519, a Model Project for Women and Girls (MPWG).  \r\n  The course improved GRE practice scores significantly.  \r\n  A number of faculty contacted the PI regarding testing the prep course at their campuses.\r\n  The planning grant would facilitate communication between faculty who wish to test the SMART GRE Prep Course at women's colleges.  The partner institutions include Baylor College of Medicine, Mount St. Mary's University, Mount Holyoke, Spelman College, Texas Women's University, Wesleyan College and possibly Wellesley College.  This grant would improve planning a collaborative effort by funding:  (1) continued assessment of a GRE Prep Course, (2) visits to campuses to facilitate planning GRE Prep Courses and institutional partnerships and (3) a mini-conference to finalize preparation of a Large Collaborative Project.\r\n",
