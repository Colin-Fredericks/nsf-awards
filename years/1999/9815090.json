In particular, we are primarily interested in obtaining nanoscale information on the morphology, structure, and reactivity of environmental particles as well as molecular information on the mineral phases/assemblages that comprise these particles.  Our central hypothesis is that the existence of mixed valence states of Fe and Mn governs the reactivity of these authigenic iron and managanese phases.  This investigation will focus on particles formed at the semi-permanent oxic/anoxic transition present in a small lake characterized by a biogenic meromixis: Paul Lake (MI).\r\n\r\nTo reach these objectives we shall use a combination of microscopic and spectroscopic methods.  Paul Lake particles will be collected and prepared for microscopic observations using SEM and TEM.  The elemental composition of individual particles will be determined, at the nano-scale, using either EDS or EELS.  Concurrently, the changes of the local molecular environment of selected metals in the particles will be probed using in situ X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure XAFS techniques.\r\n\r\nThe expected result of this research is a better characterization of the particles\r\nthat are formed at oxic/anoxic transitions in aquatic systems.  The chemical composition, redox speciation, and molecular structure of these particles will provide valuable information for predicting the fate of metals and exotic chemicals that bind selectively to these particulate phases.\r\n",
