 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development, different proteins are expressed by cells as different genes within those cells are turned on and off.  Understanding such gene regulation is crucial for understanding developmental mechanisms.   The developing brain is particularly complex, forming highly specific connections, and having whole groups of cells migrate through other cells to form discrete layers.  Such activity depends in part on proteins responsible for cellular recognition and guidance.   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) exploits new molecular technology for a novel approach to regulating gene 'knockdown.'  By injecting compounds called oligonucleotides directly into relevant regions, particular genes in a local area and at a particular time may be prevented from normal protein expression.  If successful, this new technique has great advantages of simplicity and specificity, not requiring creation or maintenance of stocks of transgenic or mutant animals. \r\n   The potential impact of this novel approach is to provide a relatively cheap and rapid approach for analysis of molecular aspects of brain development.  Its impact will also extend beyond developmental neuroscience to many areas of biology where issues of gene regulation are important.\r\n",
