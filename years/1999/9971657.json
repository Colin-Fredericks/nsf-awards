The emphasis is on adapting\r\ntechniques from the study of smooth manifolds.  In particular, he has\r\ndeveloped combinatorial versions of Morse theory and Bochner's method,\r\ntwo classical techniques from differential topology and differential\r\ngeometry, respectively.  Many others have approached the study of\r\ncombinatorial spaces from this point of view, but it seems that\r\nForman's approach is simpler than that which has come before, and also\r\nretains more of the flavor of the motivating subjects of differential\r\ntopology and geometry.  Applications have been found to the study of\r\nsmooth spaces, combinatorial spaces, and complexity theory.  The\r\nultimate goal is a unification of the study of smooth and\r\ncombinatorial spaces.\r\n     Compact combinatorial spaces can be described, in a very\r\nconvenient way, with a finite amount of data describing the local\r\nstructure near each point.  There has been a resurgence of interest in\r\nsuch spaces because they are well suited for computer experimentations\r\nand calculations.  It is not always clear how to go about determining\r\nthe global properties of such a space from the local data with which\r\nit is encoded.  On the other hand, the subjects of differential\r\ntopology and differential geometry are largely devoted to this\r\nproblem, except that the spaces under investigation are not\r\ncombinatorial, but rather smooth (and cannot be described with a\r\nfinite amount of data).  Some very general techniques have been\r\ndeveloped over recent decades for the study of smooth spaces.\r\nForman's work is devoted to showing that many of these ideas can be\r\nadapted to apply to combinatorial spaces.  This had already led to new\r\ntechniques for the study of combinatorial spaces (which have been\r\napplied to find the global topology of same very complicated\r\ncombinatorial spaces), as well as new insights into the structure of\r\nsmooth spaces.\r\n***\r\n",
