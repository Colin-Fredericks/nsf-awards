 "awd_abstract_narration": "9819424\r\nHAMNER\r\n\r\n\"Science Standards with Integrative Marine Science\" (SSWIMS) will expand upon the successful \"Leadership in Marine Science\" (LIMS)program by providing a content-rich experience for teachers that will empower them to function as leaders.  SSWIMS will reach twice as many teachers as LIMS and will serve all 51 public school districts (and private schools) in Los Angeles County.  Marine science will be the theme for an integrative science program that provides teachers with instruction in university-level science content and training in grade-appropriate, hands-on classroom and laboratory activities.  Content will be structured to incorporate both the National and the California Science Education Standards.  Over the course of four years, SSWIMS will train 320 teachers (grades 5-12) who teach approximately 105,600 students.  It is expected  the 320 teachers will in turn train an additional 2,400 teachers (through in-service), expanding the number of students affected by another 316,800.  Each year, 80 teachers will participate in a 3-day field trip to Catalina Island where they will learn marine science using shore-based facilities and onboard a research vessel; they will enroll in a marine science class on the UCLA campus during the school year, with lecture and laboratory components; and they will participate in a final 3-day workshop/retreat to discuss the impact of SSWIMS on their classroom. There is a great deal of technical and professional development support that will be available throughout the school year.  Teachers receive quarter units for science and professional development for participating. \r\n",
