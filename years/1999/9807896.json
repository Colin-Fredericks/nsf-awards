 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crystallography is one of most powerful tools for determining the three-dimensional structures of proteins and other macromolecules at atomic resolution. But despite the method's long history, determining the crystal structures of proteins is still a laborious and uncertain task. Aside from the problem of crystallizing the molecule of interest, the main obstacle is in recovering the phases of the scattered X-ray waves, information that is lost in the diffraction experiment. While this problem was largely overcome about 40 years ago for the case of small organic molecules, the problem has not been solved for large molecules like proteins. As new and important proteins are being discovered at an increasing rate, due to genome sequencing efforts for example,  more  powerful  approaches  to  the  phasing  problem  for macromolecules are essential.\r\n\r\nThis proposal attacks two particular aspects of the macromolecular phasing problem from a computational perspective. The first study aims to improve on the method of molecular replacement, a protocol that requires knowledge of a structure similar to the one that is not yet known.  The method is largely limited by the similarity between the known and unknown macromolecules.  The general problem of adjusting the 'search model' during the calculations to more closely resemble the unknown is cast as a tree-search problem and algorithms are presented for finding the optimal solution.\r\n\r\nThe second study addresses a more general aspect of macromolecular phasing.  Empirical and computational methods are used to characterize complex properties that should be obeyed by the protein electron density images or 'maps' that result, through Fourier synthesis, from the diffraction data and the phase information. Applying these derived properties as constraints should lead to better phase information and better protein maps.\r\n",
