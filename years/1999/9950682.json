 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Configurable Laboratory Book for Delivering Laboratory Experiences at a Distance project supports laboratory experiences enhancing three undergraduate courses at Washington State University.  With four campuses, the Washington State University operates an interactive telecommunication system  that links all of the campuses. What the telecommunications system lacks is the capability of delivering laboratory experiences.  This alternative approach to providing laboratory experiences at a distance is modeled after the successful NSF funded on-line lab at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC).  The laboratory experiences  developed at UTC  support chemical engineering related systems.  This project adapts those experiences to ones that support manufacturing engineering control systems.     \r\nThe project also involves the development of World Wide Web based chapters on these laboratory experiences, enabling remote users to interface with actual hardware located in the laboratory.  These chapters are designed to be configured easily into customized laboratory books.   The project enables the delivery of laboratory experiences involving specialized instrumentation and equipment within the Washington State University System and beyond consistently and for the first time.",
