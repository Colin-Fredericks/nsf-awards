 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research of Antonio Sa Barreto is divided in three main parts.\r\nIn the first topic, the investigator intends to study the\r\nexistence of resonances for second order self-adjoint perturbations of the\r\nEuclidean Laplacian.  Secondly he intends to continue his research on\r\nScattering theory for asymptotically hyperbolic\r\nmanifolds.\r\nParticular examples of such manifolds are the hyperbolic space and its\r\nquotients\r\nby certain discrete groups of linear fractional transformations. The methods\r\nused here can also be applied to study scattering for perturbations of the\r\nDe Sitter-Schwarzschild model of black holes.  The principal investigator\r\nwill  study the distributions of resonances and\r\nthe connection between the resonances and the trace of the wave group.\r\nIn the third topic, the investigator proposes to study what type of\r\ninformation can be obtained from the scattering matrix in several\r\ndifferent situations.\r\nHe proposes to consider the question of existence\r\nof transparent metric perturbations of the Euclidean metric, i.e those that\r\nare not determined by the scattering\r\nmatrix at  a fixed energy. He also intends to consider the question of\r\ndetermination of a non-compactly supported metric perturbation, that have\r\nsufficient decay at infinity, from the\r\nknowledge of the scattering matrix at  all energies.\r\nThe same questions can be posed in non-Euclidean settings, as for example,\r\nfor metric and potentials defined on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds.\r\nAs metioned above, this is in some sense the case of\r\nthe De Sitter-Schwarzschild model of black holes. One would like to know if\r\na time independent perturbation of this model by a metric and potential can be\r\nrecovered from the scattering matrix at all energies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general idea of the first project in this proposal is to study, in\r\ndifferent situations, the effects that certain\r\nperturbations have on a medium. For example how certain\r\ndisturbances will affect the propagation of light or sound.  Resonances\r\ncan be seen as a damping effect the perturbation has on the propagation of\r\nwaves. The third project concerns the reciprocal of this question, i.e\r\nknowing the effects that an unknown perturbation has on a medium, determine\r\nthe the perturbation.  In the second project the investigator will study\r\nanalogous questions for the case where the medium is ``asymptotically\r\nhyperbolic''.  A closely related and important example is the\r\nDe Sitter-Schwarzschild model of black holes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
