 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is based on the concept of a multimodal approach to the teaching of mathematics to the blind.  Speech Assisted Learning (SAL), a stand-alone technocentric system that provides education through a combination of Braille and synthetic speech, ameliorates the critical shortage of Braille instructors by providing technology with which blind students may augment teacher instruction or teach themselves new codes of Braille and mathematical concepts.  SAL is user friendly.  There is no keyboard and no commands to memorize.  Building on the protoype designed, produced, and assessed in Phase I, the goal of the Phase II project is to integrate research and education by refining hardware, software and curricula in order to develop the intellectual capacity of blind children and adults.  The advantages, disadvantages and effects on learning that result from the extended use of Speech Assisted Braille Math will be investigated.\r\n     Speech Assisted Braille Math proffers an innovative Braille math instruction system for schools, libraries, homes, government agencies, and community centers.   A new partnership will be formed to produce and carefully integrate Braille curriculum, hardware, and software, thus interconnecting  Exceptional Teaching Aids, Inc., with its background in education to Blazie Engineering, Inc. with its proven expertise in hardware development and to Duxbury Systems, Inc. a leader in the field of Braille translation.\r\n",
