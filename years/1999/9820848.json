The idea is \r\nto express different properties of convex bodies in terms of \r\nthe Fourier transform and then solve geometric problems using \r\nFourier analytic methods. This approach has already led to \r\nseveral results including the Fourier transform formulae for \r\nthe volume of sections of star bodies and a complete analytic \r\nsolution to the Busemann-Petty problem on sections of convex \r\nbodies. The emphasis is on developing new connections between\r\nthe Fourier transform and parallel section functions (X-rays) \r\nof convex bodies that will lead to new information about the \r\nstructure of subspaces of Banach spaces, geometric properties \r\nof certain classes of convex bodies. The results will also be \r\napplied to the study of positive definite norm dependent functions \r\n(theorems of Schoenberg's type) and their connections with stable \r\nand isotropic stochastic processes. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research will provide new connections between several areas of\r\nmathematics and engineering. Many of the results will have equivalent\r\nformulations in the languages of functional analysis, geometry and\r\nharmonic analysis. The study of subspaces of normed spaces is closely\r\nrelated to geometric tomography. The classical problem is to determine\r\ncertain geometric properties of a solid by means of the areas of its\r\nslices obtained with differently placed sources of X-rays. The Fourier\r\ntransform approach will contribute to this important problem in medical\r\nengineering. An application to statistics is the study of different\r\nparameters of stochastic processes under restricted data. An important\r\nexample is the problem of determining the main frequences of a signal\r\nwhen only the maximal amplitude can be measured. New techniques for\r\ncalculating the Fourier transform will serve as an important tool\r\nand will have other applications to signal processing.\r\n \r\n",
