 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nMicrobiologists from around the world are meeting in  Sydney, Australia in August, 1999 to explore  a wide-ranging set of research frontiers in bacteriology and mycology. Some of the notable bacteriological topics to be discussed include extremophiles,  molecular evolution,  intercellular signaling, and bioremedation. Major mycological topics include fungal resistance, species concepts in fungal taxonomy, population genetics of fungi, biodiversity in yeast, and secondary metabolite production.  These are among the many meaningful subjects to be addressed at the joint Congresses of the Bacteriology and Applied Microbiology Division and the Mycology Division of the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS). Hosted by the Australian Society for Microbiology and the Australian Academy of Sciences, the Congresses will give microbiologists a broad perspective on advances in their disciplines. Organized as a mixture of invited symposia and  paper sessions, it is estimated that the Congresses will attract 5,000 scientists.  To support the participation of U.S. scientists in the Congresses a competitive travel grant program has been organized. Travel grants in the amount of $2,000 will be offered to investigators who are in the early stages of their careers who plan to attend and present their research at the Congress. Teams of established and apprentice investigators who apply jointly will receive a combined $3,000 award. Experience has shown that International Congresses provide \"young\" investigators with a unique educational experience that has a lasting impact on their research careers. The meeting brings those in attendance in contact with a new world of potential collaborators and foreign colleagues in the same and related fields, leading to working partnerships and lifelong friendships. Attendees gain the opportunity to listen to internationally distinguished scientists explain the cutting edge of research across the breadth of microbiology. The International Congresses provide scientists with insight into, and understanding of, the global impact of microbiological research. \r\n",
