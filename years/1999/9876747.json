The moss specimens from the contiguous United States held in the NYBG bryophyte herbarium represent the largest single source of raw data for the Flora of North America is a project undertaken by the community of systematic botanists.  The goal is to provide authoritative, up-to-date information on the names, relationships, characteristics, and distributions of the 20,000 species of plants (vascular plants and bryophytes) that grow outside of cultivation in North America North of Mexico.  The Bryophyte Organizing Center for the Flora North America project is housed at NYBG and is headed by the P.I.  The flora will treat 315 genera of mosses, 120 genera of liverworts (1800 species total). Eighty-five different authors have agreed to contribute treatments to the bryophyte volume.  To date nenety treatments have been submitted; 21 have been reviewed and revised and will go live as provisionally published at the FNA website by the end of 1998.\r\n\r\nThis project will support the completion  of the Bryophyte Catalog and make it available electronically for use in FNA and other projects.  The project will be completed by 31 December 2000, well in advance of the deadline for the Flora of North America bryophyte volumes (scheduled for 2004).",
