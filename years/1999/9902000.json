 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researches propose to use a multi-faceted approach to measure educational gains by undergraduates at the University of Delaware who participated in their Undergraduate Research Program.  They implemented a four-year evaluation that would provide a model of assessment for dissemination to other institutions.  This proposal requests funding of two new aspects of the research.  The first component consists of using an expert in the cognitive development area to assist with measurement techniques and perform a detailed statistical analysis to integrate data from a cognitive development measure into the overall longitudinal study.  The second part is to have a postdoctoral student perform extensive analysis of the combined data from the current cognitive development study and that from another four-year study on related curricular innovation in the area of Problem-Based Learning.  The researchers' goal is to determine which combinations of parameters and analytical questions provide the best encompassing model for a multi-faceted evaluation of cognitive and educational gains in undergraduate students.",
