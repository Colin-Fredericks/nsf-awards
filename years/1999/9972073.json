The data include the largest sample of charm decays recorded to date, an increase of a factor of fifteen over the previous run with this spectrometer.   The spectrometer features excellent vertexing and particle identification, both of which had been refined and upgraded on the basis of experience with earlier runs.  Muon identification was upgraded by the Vanderbilt group which assumed primary responsibility for construction, operation, interpretation, and simulation of a new outer muon system.  This group was also responsible for implementation of the multiplicity trigger. The new data set should allow investigation of physics topics beyond the Standard Model, such as D-zero D-zero-bar mixing via semileptonic decays, rare and forbidden charm decays (flavor changing neutral currents, lepton number violating, and lepton family number violating decays), and CP violating charm decays.  This group is also involved in R&D work on the proposed BTeV program in region C0 at Fermilab, which is intended as a third generation B physics experiment, in particular the PI has been selected to lead the muon detector effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
