The proposed research focuses on three fundamental, unsolved problems that are crucial to removable data storage design: nonlinear rotating disk dynamics, aerodynamically induced instability, and floppy disk mechanics.  Each problem will be attacked theoretically and experimentally in order to fully characterize of the nonlinear mechanisms and aerodynamic excitation forces controlling these systems.  Singular perturbation theory will be exploited to simplify the underlying equations while capturing the essential physics with minimal complexity.  The results of this research will provide analytical and numerical guidance for the design of the next generation of 100+ MB removable data storage, a hotly contested market that was sharply brought into focus with the introduction of the Zip drive.  Because most existing research on nonlinear, aeroelastic, rotating disk mechanics present only negative results (e.g., results where analytical predictions contradict experimental findings), current designs are conservative and are based primarily on cut-and-try results.  The proposed research will help eliminate ad-hoc design practices and produce more reliable, higher capacity designs.\r\nThe educational activities extend three existing projects: a CAD/rapid prototyping course to enable undergraduates to develop potential solutions to on-going faculty research; further development of an on-line module in design for injection molding; and a seminar course in toy design. In addition, a project in on-line toy design for first year students that focuses on Tomagotchi/\"virtual\" toys and an upper-class elective in technology driven toy design are proposed.  These efforts will help acquaint students with the process of design and the role engineering insight and analysis plays in real world design.\r\n\r\n",
