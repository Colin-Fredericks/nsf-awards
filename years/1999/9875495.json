Guzina \r\nUniversity of Minnesota \r\n\r\nCAREER:  A Rational Framework for In-situ Geotechnical and Pavement Characterization by Wave Methods \r\n\r\nABSTRACT   \r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to provide an advanced analytical and experimental basis for site characterization by wave methods and to integrate the fundamentals of elastic wave propagation and non-destructive testing into the civil engineering curriculum.  Making use of current computational power, research will be conducted to develop a hybrid technique for realistic site characterization that would account for the three-dimensional nature of the induced wave propagation, soil stiffness, density and damping in a systematic and rigorous manner.  It includes the developments in forward and inverse wave propagation analyses and their implementation into an effective field technique for seismic sounding of geotechnical sites and pavements.  In addition to revealing the in-situ wave velocity and attenuation profiles, the new method will be capable of furnishing the independent stiffness and mass density information that is typically not available from seismic measurements.  A comprehensive delineation of dynamic soil, rock and asphalt properties by means of the proposed technique may find use in a wide range of applications such as planning of geotechnical sampling programs, design of foundations to dynamic loads, evaluation of the soil liquefaction potential, and pavement monitoring and repair.  To facilitate the implementation phase of the project, a collaboration with the Minnesota Department of Transportation has been established which will provide access to an appropriate field testing equipment and a unique experimentation site.  The foregoing research program will be conducted in conjunction with a curriculum development effort to foster the growing use of non-destructive testing in civil engineering.  To this end, efforts will be directed to design a new course on wave methods in civil engineering, and to develop a set of digital instructional modules that would introduce students to the fundamentals of elastic wave propagation and their applications to field and laboratory testing by wave methods.",
