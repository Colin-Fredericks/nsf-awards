Folk\r\n\r\n\t\t\tABSTRACT\r\n\r\nAlthough the visual world consists of multiple sources of information, \r\nthere are fundamental limits on the ability of humans to process multiple \r\nstimuli simultaneously.  Thus, a selection mechanism is needed that\r\ndetermines which sources of information are processed or \"attended\" at any given point\r\nin time.  This selection mechanism is subject to two competing constraints. On\r\nthe one hand, efficiency dictates that only those events relevant to current \r\nbehavioral goals should be attended.  On the other hand, adaptability\r\nsuggests that salient stimuli or events that may be relevant to the establishment of \r\nnew goals should also be attended.  The goal of this research is to explorea \r\nmodel of how the selection mechanism manages to satisfy both efficiency and \r\nadaptability to produce successful interaction with the environment.  The \r\nbasic premise of the model is that salient, potentially important stimulihave \r\nthe ability to automatically \"capture\" or drawn attention to themselves, but \r\nthat such attentional capture is ultimately contingent on whether theobserver \r\nis set to respond to that property.  One series of studies will critically \r\ntest this \"contingent capture\" model against other existing theoretical \r\naccounts.  The remaining studies will explore issues such as the functional \r\nstimulus classes for which selection mechanism can be set, and the\r\nfunctional mechanisms by which these attentional control settings are instantiated.  In \r\naddition to elucidating the nature of the selective attention mechanism,\r\nthis research may also have important applied implications for the development of \r\ndisplay systems that maximize the efficiency of information transfer between \r\ndisplay and operator, as well as for the diagnosis and treatment of  the \r\n\"distractability\" associated with many mental disorders.  Finally, it may \r\nserve as a guiding framework for exploring the underlying brain mechanisms \r\nassociated with attentional control. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
