 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jeffrey Cina is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical research in the area of coherence and optical control of time-dependent condensed-phase molecular systems.  Cina seeks to develop a comprehensive theory of ultrashort-pulse propagators that will facilitate the simulation of a wide variety of time-resolved nonlinear optical experiments and provide a useful tool for the further development of optical control of molecules and solids.  Various types of relaxation processes that influence the rate of electron- and energy-transfer within and between molecules will also be investigated.  Specific relaxations to be investigated include those exhibiting coherent changes in the electronic ground state; those featuring large-amplitude size or shape changes in the electronic ground state; and those involving long-range superpositions between classically distinguishable intra-molecular or host-medium configurations.  The proposed work will use a combination of formal analytical theory and computational simulation, and will involve a direct collaboration with the several experimental groups.\r\n\r\nUltra-short pulses of laser light provide a powerful means to place matter into unusual states, far from thermal equilibrium.  These states may have unusual chemical or material properties quite different from those of condensed matter in its more normal states. The work under this grant involves theoretical studies which explore the properties of these unusual states as well as how they may be prepared and how they may be detected.  The work is being carried out in close and direct contact with people who are making related experimental studies. In this way, the understanding coming from the theoretical work is being applied, in the near term, to the analysis and interpretation of experimental data.",
