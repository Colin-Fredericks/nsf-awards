 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapidly evolving nature of the mobile application base, mobile service demands and underlying network technologies presents a significant challenge to the mobile computing and communications research community. Existing mobile network architectures exhibit three basic limitations that prevent us from meeting this challenge: (i) the lack of quality of service support for the transport of audio, video and\r\nreal-time data;  (ii) the lack of intrinsic architectural flexibility in the adaptation to new mobile user and service provider needs; and (iii) the lack of automation of the process of realization and deployment of\r\nnew and distinct mobile network architectures. In response to these limitations, the PI argues that there is a critical need to propose, investigate and evaluate alternative mobile network architectures to\r\nthose existing today. The proposed research goes far beyond a proposal for yet another experimental mobile network architecture, e.g., mobile IP++. Rather, it calls for new innovative approaches to the way we\r\ndesign, develop, deploy, observe and analyze next-generation mobile networking architectures in response to the future needs and requirements of mobile users, service providers and equipment vendors.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research in \"spawning networks\" is to: (i) establish a methodology and creation environment for spawning and prototyping virtual mobile networks and their architectures; (ii) deploy programmable foundation services, network controllers and open programmable networking interfaces for a distinct set of baseline architectures that will include a new broadband cellular network architecture, next-generation mobile Internet architecture and mobile ad hoc network architecture; (iii) demonstrate the spawning, visualization and management of these baseline virtual mobile networks over the same physical high-speed mobile networking testbed; and (iv) investigate trade-offs in the architectural design space of the spawned architecture through visualization, management and refinement.\r\n\r\nThe realization of spawning networks capable of profiling, spawning, visualizing and managing distinct virtual mobile networking architectures will represent a major shift in the way network architects design, deploy and manage new and novel mobile networking architectures.\r\n\r\nThe PI is also responding to the strong demands from industry and academia for graduate students with mobile networking and distributed systems skills through the introduction of new and innovative initiatives in education. The PI has introduced a graduate-level course in Wireless and Mobile Networking and is teaching another newly created course in Distributed Telecommunications Systems. Each course addresses\r\nfundamental concepts, through the presentation of state-of-the-art research seminars from some of industry's leading researchers and emphasizes \"hands on\" term projects. The PI is very keen to promote\r\ninteraction between academia and industry. This interaction provides a great learning opportunity benefiting students, faculty and industry alike.\r\n\r\n",
