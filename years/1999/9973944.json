 "awd_abstract_narration": "Afenya\r\n9973944\r\n     The investigator develops mathematical models of several\r\nproblems arising in biology and medicine.  These include studies\r\nof models of normal and cancerous cells considered as interacting\r\ncell populations; investigations of normal and cancer cell\r\nbehavior in the bone marrow, blood, and the active and resting\r\nphases of the cell cycle; studies of the inherent effects of time\r\nlags in the development of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)\r\nand cancer; and studies of MDS and cancer from diffusion-oriented\r\nviewpoints.  The treatment of cancer and MDS is looked at as a\r\nformal optimization problem.  Various functions that represent\r\nmedical and financial costs to patients during treatment are\r\nderived and minimized or maximized subject to constraining\r\nordinary differential equations.  Following this, techniques are\r\ndeveloped for controlling model equations that involve partial\r\ndifferential equations.  Within this framework, optimal strategies\r\nthat address problems such as patient recuperation after\r\ntreatment, multidrug resistance, patient sensitivity to\r\nanticancer agents, minimal residual disease, and low versus high\r\ndose continuous infusions are considered.  Statistical and\r\nprobabilistic methods are used to manipulate and study cancer\r\ndata.  From the data, model parameters that describe cell growth\r\nand death rates are estimated by employing concepts of the growth\r\nfraction, cell cycle and flow cytometric measurements, and\r\napoptotic information.  Techniques are also developed for\r\nestimating other relevant model parameters, such as measures of\r\ncontact inhibition between cells, from data.\r\n     The objectives of the project include studies and modeling\r\nof precancerous syndromes and disseminated cancers such as the\r\nleukemias and lymphomas from a biomathematical viewpoint.  The\r\nfocus is on: a) Construction of mathematical models that\r\nquantitatively and qualitatively shed light on mechanisms\r\ninherent in the precancerous syndromes and disseminated cancers;\r\nb) Studies and comparisons of various treatment protocols through\r\nthe use of predictive treatment optimization models with the view\r\nto suggesting ways in which treatment could be improved.\r\nBiomedicine is becoming increasingly quantitative in scope and\r\ncontent as the fight against all kinds of diseases such as cancer\r\ncontinues.  Nevertheless, the use of mathematical techniques that\r\nare well suited for analyzing, synthesizing, and comprehending\r\nsuch quantitative information are relatively limited in this\r\nimportant area.  Also, clinicians and medical practitioners are\r\nalways faced with problems such as the exact length of time to\r\ncarry out treatment, infusions of the right amounts of drugs that\r\nare adequate for patient recovery, and overall patient safety.\r\nThese issues demand that the best treatment strategies be found\r\nwhen dealing with patients in the clinic.  The need also exists\r\nfor multidisciplinary approaches in tackling problems that\r\ncontinually arise in the clinic.  It is within these frameworks\r\nthat mathematical modeling in the area of biomedicine assumes\r\nsignificance and importance.  The mathematical models serve as a\r\nfirst line of approach and a cost-effective way of gaining\r\ninsight into cancer and MDS without initially resorting to\r\nexpensive clinical trials.  The predictive nature of the models\r\ngives the clinician various options about the specific way to\r\nproceed in dealing with the problems of the patient.  It is\r\nenvisioned that knowledge gained from the research activities\r\nwill aid in the fight against cancer as a whole and have an\r\nimpact on clinical trails of new therapeutic strategies.  Such\r\nknowledge will also have a positive impact on drug delivery\r\nsystems and the area of biomedical technology.\r\n",
