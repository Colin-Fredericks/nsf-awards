 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve and Biological Research Station (HPBRS) is a not-for-profit membership corporation whose purposes are preservation, and research and education in the biological sciences.  The 800 ha preserve occupies the region around the Ten Mile Creek, a hanging valley on the Helderberg Plateau in Albany County, NY.  Between 1994 and 1998, 52 Ph.D. level scientists and 60 graduate students and research assistants have conducted studies on the Preserve.  Forty of these researchers received one or more grants from the HPBRS to support their work.  These scientists came from 28 colleges and universities in 13 states and 7 countries.  Since 1994 13 doctoral and 11 master candidates conducted research on the Preserve.  Currently 7 dissertation projects are underway.  Eleven postdoctoral associates have worked here in that time.  The HPBRS offers educational opportunities for students of all ages including interpretative tours, all-day workshops, teacher training workshops, consulting in schools, and Elderhostel.  Since 1994, 2369 elementary, 1024 secondary, 1360 undergraduates and 310 teachers have visited the Preserve to practice hands-on environmental science.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1986, the HPBRS embarked on a program to improve its physical facilities to increase the numbers of scientists and students utilizing it.  In 1988 research equipment in the Eldridge Lab was upgraded.  Over the subsequent two years the laboratory building, was winterized, and refurbished as was Lincoln Pond Cottage, one of the researcher residences.  In 1992 the HPBRS's Board of Directors approved a long-term plan to continue the development of the Preserve's infrastructure.  That plan recognized that the Preserve needed an enlarged laboratory and more appropriate residences for  visiting researchers.  In 1995 the Preserve received support for the laboratory addition.\r\n\r\nThis project will refurbish the four structures collectively known as Bullfrog Camp Complex-one of the two primary residences for visiting researchers and students.  The work will include rebuilding Bullfrog Camp cabin to increase housing space and improve the kitchen and dining areas.  A new bathhouse will be built.  Bird House cabin will be renovated and the Horse cabin made into a two bedroom facility.  All buildings will be handicap accessible.  The refurbishment of Bullfrog camp will increase the ability of the HPBRS to house researchers and students in a clean and safe environment.  The refurbishment of the Bullfrog Camp Complex will improve the infrastructure needed to allow for an increase in research and training in biological field sciences.\r\n",
