The workshop involves US researchers' participation in the European Science Foundation's ongoing Tropical Canopy Programme, whose goals are to foster and enhance collaborative efforts on a European level to study and understand tropical forest canopies. The workshop has been organized on the US side by Nalini Nadkarni of Evergreen State College, and on the European side by Eduard Linsenmair at the University of Wuerzburg in Germany.  European researchers will be present from Germany, Denmark, The Netherlands, France, and the UK.  They will discuss the emergence of canopy research as an emerging science and its links to allied fields, present case studies of developing fields, and generate goals and strategies for canopy research.  The ultimate objective is to develop a coherent and integrative research planning process that will assist the canopy research community to formulate and implement large-scale and long-term collaborative canopy research in the future.\r\n",
