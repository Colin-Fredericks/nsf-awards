 "awd_abstract_narration": "9976852\r\nTsui\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for the development of an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) compatible scanning evanescent microwave microscope (SEMM) with a variable temperature sample stage and a superconducting magnet to study structural, magnetic, and conduction properties of novel nanometer scale materials. It is a collaborative effort between researchers at the\r\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL), and Ariel Technologies, Inc.\r\n\r\nThe proposed instrument is a one-of-the-kind scanning probe microscope (SPM) capable of measuring microwave response with nanometer scale resolution in a magnetic field and at low temperatures. The ability to modulate magnetic field and to vary\r\ntemperature will expand the capabilities of the current SEMM technique significantly, including scanning probe magnetic resonance experiments. The instrument will provide powerful but versatile capabilities for the materials research community and it also will serve as a vital part of the nanometer scale materials activities at UNC-CH.  Proposed research activities include (1) spatially resolved microwave resonance experiments on metallic thin films and multilayers synthesized using combinatorial approach, (2) spatially resolved dielectric and conduction properties of doped perovskites, (3) SEMM as a probe of quantum effects in mesoscopic and nanometer conductors, (4) magnetic topology of photosynthesis complex of plants. The goal is to elucidate the structural and magnetic excitations in nanometer scale materials.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide significant opportunities for strong interactions between students, researchers, and private sector\r\npartners, and for participants to get involved with and to make significant contributions to significant advances in science and technology. \r\n&&&\r\nThis multi-institutional collaborative activity is expected to significantly impact science, education, and partnerships.\r\n",
