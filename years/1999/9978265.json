 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mountain Lake Biological Station was founded in 1921 as an inland field station for and teaching in the Southern Appalachians.  In the last twenty years the research program has developed a focus in population biology with an emphasis in ecological genetics.  Projects currently being conducted include studies of the genetics and epidemiology of a sexually transmitted disease in a plant, the behavioral and physiological ecology of juncos, the genetic structure of a local metapopulation, ecology and evolution of polymorphic life history in a plant, life history evolution and species interactions in salamanders, biosystematics and evolutionary genetics of ferns evolution of plant sex ratio biases, behavioral ecology and mate choice in salamanders, adaptive significance of the biological clock in chipmunks, the evolution of parasitic plants, and the genetic structure of seedbanks.\r\n\r\nMountain Lake houses up to 100 students, faculty and researchers at a time.  Most of the living quarters were built in the late 1930s and aside from renovations of plumbing, porches and some roofs in 1992, they have not been renovated since.  Many of the accommodations are run-down and pose health and safety risks.  This project will support the renovation of most of the older cabins on the station.  Windows and doors containing lead paint and asbestos will be replaced in 16 of the older buildings; crumbling interior walls and wiring will be replaced in 5 of the largest student dorms; leaking roofs will be replaced in 5 cabins.\r\n\r\nThe other primary area to be upgraded is in computer and telecommunication facilities.  Researchers and students alike now require current computer and telephone technology and facilities to conduct their work.  This project will support the installation of a full-service server/client computer and telephone network to provide file and application serving, full Internet access and telephone service to all research and teaching labs, administrative offices, and the computer lab on the station.    \r\n",
