 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Southern Mississippi is improving the content, method of instruction, and delivery of two sequential introductory biology courses.  A summer workshop is bringing together faculty members from two universities, and three area community colleges, graduate teaching assistants, and preservice teachers to learn from instructional experts how to use constructivist-based investigations and cooperative learning techniques. The instructional materials are being transformed from cookbook exercises into investigative activities integrated with the lecture materials to develop the processes of science and problem solving skills of students through experimentation and research projects. The efforts are an adaptation of projects funded previously by NSF, such as BioQuest centered at Beloit College, the Human Genome Project at BSCS, and Louisiana Tech University. The various typologies of cooperative learning are being used to cultivate teamwork, positive interdependence, and individual and group accountability. The plan also includes the use of technology in data collection, calculation, simulation and modeling to teach problem-solving skills. Two introductory biology instructors from Jackson State University with experience in computer-assisted instruction will collaborate in the project. In addition, three area community colleges will share their experiences in developing critical thinking in biology. A feature of this project is the opportunity to provide experience in curriculum development and constructivist methods of teaching and assessment to graduate teaching assistants who are future faculty members. After one year of implementation and evaluation, participants will collaborate with one another to formalize strategies by which these reforms in introductory biology courses can be institutionalized.\r\n\r\n",
