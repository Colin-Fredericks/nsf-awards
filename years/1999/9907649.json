The FWS is constructing a new building near the field station, that will house the FWS and field station administrative offices, a new public visitor center, a research/education laboratory, and a conference/workshop facility with kitchen.  The project will provide support primarily  for equipping the laboratory and conference facilities, and for providing two vehicles for field work and education on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge.  The new facilities will relieve the heavy pressure of users on the existing field station in both research and conference activities by expanding available research space by 40% and doubling the existing conference/workshop space, and will greatly enhance the public outreach programs for environmental education of the general public and K-12 schoolchildren.  This tripartite between UNM, TNC, and FWS will continue to foster the common policy goals of all three organizations in promoting research and public education in this unique region of New Mexico. \r\n",
