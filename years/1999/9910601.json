Perceptual organization can be defined as the ability to impose structural regularity on sensory data in an image, so as to group sensory primitives arising from a common underlying cause.  Such extraction of meaning from sensory input is an intelligent process.  Perceptual organization has long been studied by researchers in human vision and has begun to draw increasing attention in the computer vision research community because of its important potential.  This workshop will provide a valuable forum for researchers from both computer vision and human vision communities to assess the state of the art, identify basic research issues, and discuss promising new research directions in perceptual organization for computer vision.  The workshop will be held in conjunction with the 1999 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision to be held in Kerkyra, Greece.\r\n",
