 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nGeorgia Bishop\r\nIBN #99-04715\r\n\r\n\r\n      It is well established that communication in the brain is mediated by different chemicals.  These different chemicals are released from nerve endings after which time they diffuse across a narrow space to reach their targets.  Target cells contain membrane specializations, called receptors that bind the released chemicals.  The act of binding the chemicals causes changes in the target neuron, which may make it more or less excitable.  Recent studies have shown that most, if not all nerve terminals contain several different types of chemicals or co-transmitters.  The presence of different combinations of co-transmitters in nerve terminals indicates that there are chemically coded subpopulations of neurons that are capable of eliciting unique responses from target cells that are dependent on the specific combination of chemicals released following nerve cell activation.  The intent of this proposal is to investigate a co-transmitter called corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in the cerebellum, a part of the brain that is involved in co-ordinating motor activity.  Of all the co-transmitters described in the cerebellum, only CRF is present in all species examined to date suggesting it is a highly conserved substance that plays an important role in mediating neurotransmission across species.  It is our hypothesis that CRF is released only when activity in nerve fibers is very high.  Further, we postulate that CRF will influence the way a target nerve cell responds to other chemicals released by the same or other nerve terminals.  To test these hypotheses we must establish whether changes in firing rate alter the amount of CRF that is released.  Further, we must determine how CRF interacts with other chemicals that are released in the vicinity of a target cell.  Finally, we will use anatomical techniques to identify the location of the receptors that mediate the effect of CRF.  Two different types of CRF receptors have been described.  In this study, we will determine which one is in the cerebellum and exactly where it is located.  At present, little is known about how CRF, or other chemicals, are released from nerve terminals.  The data from this study will advance our understanding of the complex manner in which CRF acts as a co-transmitter in cerebellar circuitry.  These data will further our understanding of how the cerebellum controls and co-ordinates movements.\r\n",
