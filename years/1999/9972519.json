 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algorithms that find a good partitioning of highly unstructured and irregular graphs are critical for developing efficient solutions of a wide range of problems including parallel execution of scientific simulations. The traditional graph partitioning problem focuses on computing a k-way partition of a graph such that the edge-cut is minimized and each partition has an equal number of vertices (or in the case of weighted graphs, the sum of the vertex-weights in each partition are the same). The task of minimizing the edge-cut can be considered as the objective and the requirement that the partitions will be of the same size can be considered as the constraint. Unfortunately, this single-constraint single-objective graph partitioning problem is not sufficient to model the underlying requirements of many current and emerging applications, especially in the area of high performance scientific simulations. In particular, the effective parallel solution of multi-physics and multi-phase computations in areas such as automobile engine design, crash-worthiness testing, fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, etc., requires that the partitioning algorithm simultaneously balances the computations performed during each one of the phases and minimizes the various communication overheads--none of which can be accomplished by the current graph models and partitioning algorithms. The key characteristic of these applications is that they require the partitioning algorithm to handle an arbitrary number of balancing constraints as well as an arbitrary number of optimization (either minimization or maximization) objectives. This project will develop new generalized models for graph partitioning that are able to model the requirements of many existing and emerging problems in high-performance scientific simulations that cannot be modeled within the current framework, as well as algorithms for solving these problems. The graph models and partitioning algorithms will be tested and validated on a wide range of problems obtained from industrial and government sources.",
