 "awd_abstract_narration": "The jakobid flagellates may be among the most ancestral of living\r\neukaryotes.  Information from the mitochondrial genomes of two jakobid\r\nspecies, Jakoba libera and Reclinomonas americana, suggests that the\r\nancestors of jakobids were among the first eukaryotes to acquire\r\nmitochondria. The jakobids, therefore, may represent an informative model\r\nsystem for the study of the origin and early divergence of eukaryotic cells.\r\n To better understand these organisms, a knowledge of their taxonomic\r\ndiversity and relationship to other protists is required.  We do not have\r\nthis knowledge at present.\r\n\r\nIn this \"proof of concept\" study, existing species descriptions of jakobid\r\nflagellates will be assembled and critically analyzed, with examination of\r\ntype specimens when these exist.  Data on the morphology, ultrastructure,\r\nand life history of jakobid species will be obtained from published papers\r\nand from new investigations on species isolated from nature.  These data\r\nwill be used to construct data matrices for phylogenetic analysis.  Nuclear\r\nsmall-subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences will be obtained from cultivated\r\nspecies for use as species identifiers (e.g., for subsequent molecular\r\nprobe design) and, with the morphological data, for phylogenetic analyses.\r\nPreliminary data in these categories will be collected from exemplar taxa of\r\nTrimastigida, Retortamonadida and Diplomonadida, three groups of protists\r\nthat closely resemble the jakobids in many ways and may be their closest\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nThis work is expected to result in the description of several new jakobid\r\nspecies and in preliminary assessments of the relationships of jakobids with\r\neach other and with other protists.  The resulting monograph, online and in\r\nprint form, together with associated publications, should provide a welcome\r\nresource for persons interested in early organismal evolution and microbial\r\ndiversity.\r\n\r\n",
