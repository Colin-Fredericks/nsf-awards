This is one of a series of canonical problems introduced to develop new propagation models for wireless communications. The basic assumption is that the earth can be modeled by a sphere whose surface is initially considered to be locally smooth and flat, while all objects above it can be simulated by spheres/spheroids, some of which may be partially buried in the ground. All the spheres/spheroids used in the model range from perfectly conducting on the one extreme to imperfectly conducting- with complex permittivity on the other extreme. The solution of this canonical problem is particularly relevant to analyzing the scattering by complex three-dimensional bodies, such as plastic mines, icebergs, rough surfaces, etc., in which the assumed locally-flat background can be modeled by the ground plane and the complex body can be simulated by a sphere/spheroid or a system of spheres/spheroids in free space or partially buried in the ground plane. The incident wave is assumed to be a uniform plane electromagnetic wave of arbitrary angle of incidence. The method of images is applied to replace the partially buried sphere in a ground plane by two overlapping spheres of equal size, or by two touching spheres of equal size if the sphere is resting on the ground plane, and a supplementary incident plane electromagnetic wave such that the total electric field is satisfied at all points where the ground plane is located in the original problem. The incident, supplementary and scattered fields are expressed in terms of appropriate spherical wave functions. To impose the boundary conditions on the surfaces of the spheres, the translation addition theorem for the spherical wave functions are used to express the coordinate system of the scattered field from one sphere in terms of the coordinate system of the other sphere leading to a matrix equation which can be inverted numerically to recover the scattered field coefficients. The problem is formulated such that the boundary condition on the surface of each sphere can also be satisfied by an iterative approach. This iterative procedure continues until the solution converges, and has the obvious advantage that it does not require matrix inversion since the scattered field coefficients in each iteration are obtained and used in the next iteration. The scattered field coefficients generated by the exact and iterative methods are obtained, from which the scattered field can be evaluated everywhere. In particular, the scattering cross section can be calculated as a function of the sphere radius and permittivity as well as the burial distance for any specified angle of incidence.\r\n\r\nIn order to solve the inverse scattering problem, we employ a radial basis function network which consists of an input layer with four inputs, a hidden layer using Gaussian nonlinearity functions, and an output layer with three outputs. The four inputs in the input layer are the real and imaginary values of the computed scattered field complex coefficients for the TE and TM polarization cases, while the outputs are the electrical radius and burial distance of the training sphere as well as its relative permittivity. This network is then trained using the orthogonal least-squares algorithm with a specified range of the electrical radius and a specified number of learning data samples (50 for each output) to train the network in order to retrieve the radius, burial distance and relative permittivity of the test sphere for new data (usually experimental) which is different from the learning data.\r\n***\r\n",
