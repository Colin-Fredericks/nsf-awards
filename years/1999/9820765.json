 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the development of estimation and control strategies for input-output and state-space models with bounded data uncertainties.  The new methods will be referred to as BDU estimation and BDU control methods for brevity.  They are based on new constrained game-type formulations that allow the designer to explicitly incorporate into the problem statement a-priori information about bounds on the sizes of the uncertainties in the models.  In this way, the effect of uncertainties will not be unnecessarily over-emphasized beyound what is implied by the a-priori bounds; consequently, overly conservative designs, as well as overly sensitive designs, will be avoided.\r\n\r\nA Key feature of the BDU formulations is that geometric insights (such as orthogonality conditions and projections) and recursive (adaptive or online) techniques, which are widely known and appreciated for classical quadratic-cost designs, can be pursued in this new framework.  Also, algorithms for computing optimal solutions with the same computational effort as standard least-squares solutions exist, thus making the new formulations attractive for practical use.\r\n\r\nA major theme in this work will be the emphasis on geometric constructions, on state-space formulations, and on design for models with parametric uncertainties.  Applications accross several disciplines, including image processing, communications, adaptive systems, estimation, and control, will be pursued.  Despite the interesting preliminary results, several issues remain open and indicate potential future developments.",
