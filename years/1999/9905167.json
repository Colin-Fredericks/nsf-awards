Specific goals include uncovering what regulates the production of magma.  Our work will address this goal by clarifying the nature of the slab fluxes in Central America.  We recently discovered unusual trace element systematics in lavas from Central America. The data are best explained by mixing between two end-members, thus there are at least two fluxes to identify.  The sediment section, subducting beneath Central America, also has two end-members; a lower carbonate ooze and an upper hemipelagic mud.  These lithologies have hugely different trace element signatures and, in general, the chemical signatures of the sediments match up with the two end-members seen in the lavas.  We identify the origin of the two geochemical end-members as the subducted sediments, but how do sediments become fluxing agents that trigger melting and volcanism?  Do they move into the mantle as hydrous fluids or as melts?  Our proposed project can answer half of the latter question by employing very precise isotopic measurements.  The Sr-Nd isotopic data for Central American lavas define an array apparently involving the same end members seen in the trace element data.  The far more precise isotopic data have the potential to severely restrict interpretations once sufficient data are available. The geometry of the isotopic mixing lines for Central America is such that a flux from the upper, hemipelagic sediments can be a melt but can not be a hydrous fluid. To establish this, we plan to expand the data set, which at present is too sparse to allow us to state this as a firm conclusion\r\n",
