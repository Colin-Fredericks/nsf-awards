The present proposal considers snow not as a passive responder but as an active driver of climate variability on multiple scales.  The effects of snow cover within the western US and the climate signals due to remote snow forcing will be considered. Empirical analyses and a suite of model experiments will be conducted. The work is important because it will lead to enhanced understanding of the role of snow cover in climate variability on a range of spatial and temporal scales.\r\n",
