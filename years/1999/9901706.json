Tao\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nDespite the significant body of results in real-time scheduling, many\r\nreal world problems are not easily supported.  While algorithms such as\r\nEarliest Deadline First, Rate Monotonic, and the Spring scheduling\r\nalgorithm can support sophisticated task set characteristics (such as\r\ndeadlines, precedence constraints, shared resources, jitter, etc.), they\r\nare all \"open loop\" scheduling algorithms.  Open loop refers to the \r\nfact that once schedules are created they are not \"adjusted\" based \r\non continuous feedback. While open-loop scheduling algorithms can \r\nperform well in static or dynamic systems in which the workloads can \r\nbe accuratedly modeled, they can perform poorly in unpredictable dynamic \r\nsystems, i.e., systems whose workloads cannot be accurately modeled.  \r\nUnfortunately, many real-world complex systems are dynamic and \r\nunpredictable.  In addition, most scheduling paradigms assume that\r\ntiming requirements are known and fixed, while in real systems timing \r\nrequirements are more flexible.  For example, instead of a single \r\nfixed deadline for a task, a deadline range might be acceptable to \r\nthe physical system.  If this range was passed to the scheduling system, \r\nmore robust scheduling could be possible.\r\n\r\nWe propose to develop the\r\nbeginnings of a new scheduling paradigm, which we call feedback\r\ncontrol real-time scheduling.  Feedback control real-time scheduling will\r\ndefine error terms for schedules, monitor the error, and continuously adjust\r\nthe schedules to maintain stable performance.  Feedback control real-time\r\nscheduling will be able to deal with dynamic systems that are both resource\r\ninsufficient and with unpredictable workload.  It can also be integrated \r\nwith flexible real-time requirements.  We plan to base this new paradigm \r\non the theory and practice of control theory, adaptive control theory, \r\nand stochastic control.  In this proposed research we will begin by \r\nintegrating practical feedback control techniques into scheduling \r\nalgorithms.  These scheduling algorithms regard the computer system \r\nas a control system with the scheduler as the controller.  The\r\noutcome from this beginning study\r\nshould include a practical scheduling algorithm, plus some\r\nexperimental evidence to use in the long-term endeavor of creating \r\na theory and practice of feedback control scheduling.  Such results will \r\napply to many real world systems including real-time database applications, \r\ndefense applications, agile manufacturing, and distributed multimedia.  \r\nThe results would be that these systems meet significantly more deadlines \r\nthereby improving the productivity of a manufacturing plant or an on-line \r\nreal-time database system.  General principles developed in this research \r\nshould also be applicable to feedback scheduling in non-real-time systems.  \r\nThis could improve the throughput and performance of general timesharing \r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
