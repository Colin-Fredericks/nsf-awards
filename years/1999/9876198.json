The model will first be applied to the simulation and design of physical vapor transport (PVT)-based bulk growth of silicon carbide (SiC) crystals and hydrothermal growth of optical materials.  SiC is a wide band-gap material with physical and electronic properties unmatched for high temperature, high frequency, high power devices.  Applications ranging from greatly improved high voltage switching to sensors for control of engine emissions are envisioned; however, these applications are yet to be realized primarily because crystal growth methodology and device fabrication technology are not sufficiently developed.  Physical phenomena in both PVT growth of SiC and hydrothermal synthesis include the dissolution and sublimation of polycrystalline materials, which involve transport of charge and chemical species as well as deposition on the seed surface.  The virtual prototyping algorithm will incorporate robust process modeling techniques for transport phenomena, geometric models, and process animation.  The proposed research will bring together the knowledge developed in the fields of process modeling, geometric modeling, computer graphics, CAD, visualization and animation, and software development to model a wide range of materials processes that are based on PVT, CVD, and solution growth techniques.  Educational initiatives will include development of new courses in the field of modeling and virtual prototyping.\r\n",
