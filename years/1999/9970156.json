 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\tProfessor Shahidi will continue his study of the holomorphy of symmetric cube L-functions for non-monomial cusp forms on the general linear group on dimension two vector spaces. This is the first step in establishing the existence of the symmetric cube lift to the general linear group on dimension four spaces.  The investigator will also consider the questions of poles of all L-functions that are obtained from a method previously established in conjunction with R. Langlands.  Also under consideration is the boundedness or finiteness of order on finite strips of theses functions.  In a related project Professor Shahidi will attempt to increase the applications for Arthur's trace formula to the most general cases by establishing new identities satisfied by normalized intertwining operators.\r\n\r\n\tThis project involves questions in number theory and representation theory.  Historically there have been many examples in mathematics where important information about the fundamental properties of numbers is encoded in the functions of calculus.  An important advance in number theory over the past twenty years has been the increased understanding that these examples were part of a very general theory.  The full general theory is still quite a mathematical mystery. It is so powerful, however, that each time a step toward the general theory is made,  the repercussions are felt in all parts of number theory and representation theory. L-functions are the functions that often encode the information that number theorists need, and the information appears at points called the poles of the function. In this project, Professor Shahidi will investigate several methods of extracting this information from the function.",
