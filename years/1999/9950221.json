 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry faculty at Western Carolina University (WCU), a primarily undergraduate institution in the Southern Appalachians, are developing an environmental focus to the curriculum.  This focus, previously developed at Arkansas State University and WCU with NSF support, is a natural fit based on the ecologically diverse location of WCU and the students' employment record in the environmental sciences.  Novel, environmental experiments are being implemented to promote student learning in (1) monitoring elements and ions in environmental samples, such as soil, water, and air; (2) the treatment and monitoring of chemical waste from freshman chemistry laboratories; (3) using natural water systems to demonstrate the fundamental principles of solubility and complex-ion formation; (4) analytical method development; and (5) undergraduate research.  Inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and ion chromatography (IC) are powerful techniques to facilitate the learning discussed above and are widely used in environmental analysis.  Using environmental applications, ICP-OES and IC instruments are being integrated into the curriculum to achieve the student learning described above.  Novel experiments involving this instrumentation include the evaluation of soil fertility in our general chemistry course, the characterization of the effects of waste from trout hatching and rearing facilities on water quality in a junior-level Aquatic Chemistry course, and the measurement of air quality at high elevation sites in our region in a senior-level Environmental Chemistry course.  An Instrumental Analysis class is treating chemical waste from a freshman chemistry laboratory, and monitoring the levels of metals by ICP-OES. The senior-level Instrumental Analysis II students are employing project-based laboratories for learning method development, as developed at Bates College with NSF support.  The instrumentation is finding applications in a vigorous undergraduate research program.  Our findings using this novel approach are to be disseminated through pedagogical journals (Journal of Chemical Education) and a web site.\r\n",
