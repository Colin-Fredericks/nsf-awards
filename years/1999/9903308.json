 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitchell\r\n9903308\r\n\r\nThe number of flowers blooming simultaneously on a self-fertile plant may have profound consequences for reproductive success.  For example, plants with large displays may receive more pollinator visits, increasing seed production.  However, large displays may also entail significant costs.  Self-pollination is more likely, since large displays promote within-plant pollinator movements.  If there is inbreeding depression, female reproductive success will suffer.  Self-pollination may also decrease pollen transfer to other plants, reducing male reproductive success.  This project utilizes a novel experimental system to test the hypothesis that these conflicting selection pressures favor the evolution of intermediate-sized floral displays.  Monkeyflower (Mimulus ringens) displays will be manipulated in replicate (cloned) populations consisting of genetically distinct individuals.  These arrays facilitate unambiguous measures of paternity and individual selfing rates.  Manipulation of floral display size on a common genetic background allows examination of how floral display and other traits interact in affecting reproductive success.  To examine how floral display may evolve in natural populations, an artificial selection experiment will be conducted under field conditions in a common garden.  \r\n\r\nThese experiments will provide unique data concerning the adaptive significance of floral displays, and will enhance our understanding of the evolution of plant mating systems.  The results of this research will also have important implications for agriculture (breeding of crops to maximize yield) and conservation biology (maximizing reproductive success of endangered species in botanic gardens).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
