 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to analyze the behavior and study control and management issues for next generation networks by means of non-traditional modeling and analysis.  In future integrated services networks, congestion phenomena are likely to be quite different in nature than those in more traditional systems such as the Internet.  The reason is that, at the cell level, the phenomena of long-range dependence and high variability are going to play a major role in the way we analyze, design and provide services over a network.  While these phenomena have already been observed and statistically analyzed in existing systems, integration of services is expected to amplify them.  The first part of the proposed research deals with\r\na further justification of the investigator's recent findings that explain how Levy processes arise as\r\nmacroscopic models of certain types of long-range dependent traffic.  The justification is done by rigorously deriving macroscopic approximations of the probability distributions of the traffic processes.  In addition, comparison with and further analysis and simulation of fractional Brownian motions is also proposed.\r\nThe investigator also proposes to explicitly study the consequences of these models (and, in particular Levy processes) to performance and control.  He proposes to use sample path formulas and conservation laws in order to derive explicit solutions of solvable systems.  Networks in tandem with stable-Levy motions inputs are promising candidates for explicit solvability. In the sequel, and in order to deal with non-solvable situations, he proposes to examine extremes of distributions and delays.  The tasks involved here call for extensions of large deviations results and applications to networks with feedback.  The impact of this study will be the understanding of the way that congestions occur in highly variable environments and will,\r\nas in risk theory, help prevent catastrophes in networks.  The proposed control methods involve stochastic\r\ndifferential equations that can also be explained as arising from long-range dependent systems.  By studying\r\noptimal control problems, the investigator proposes to tackle buffer management schemes.  Finally, he proposes to examine the impact of imposing deterministic or shaping regulatory constraints on stochastic traffic, derive worst-case scenaria and combine statistical and deterministic descriptors.  The impact of this study will lead to further standardization of descriptors for next generation networks.  Such descriptors\r\nare invaluable for the provision of services and the design of correct pricing schemes.  A rather significant aspect of the proposed research lies in its fundamental character in that it re-examines the performance models and opts for simple and tractable paradigms that can be communicated to students but also used by the industry.\r\n",
