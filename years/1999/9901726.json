 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project will develop an optimized ultra-short pulsed laser surgical device for high precision surgery in the sclera of the eye.  This tool may enable novel, office-based procedures to treat serious and common conditions, such as glaucoma and presbyopia.\r\nPhase I study results will be used to guide development of a new solid-state high power femtosecond laser source and scanning optical delivery system.  Performance will be evaluated in ex vivo human and animal tissue.  It is anticipated that this tool will be used to test long-lasting and minimally invasive glaucoma and presbyopia surgical procedures performed in the sclera.  These procedures will be developed through follow-up in vivo evaluations conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Michigan (to whom the device will be made available).  By providing a tool for non-invasive scleral channel formation, investigators will be able to address long-standing questions about why current glaucoma surgery fails, as well as how the loss of accommodation can be reversed.  These developments will raise the possibility of direct intervention for the two million Americans who have glaucoma and the millions more who suffer from presbyopia.\r\n     The market for glaucoma is estimated at over $5 billion, while the potential market for presbyopia is probably several times greater. Since both glaucoma and presbyopia are associated with aging, their incidence is expected to rise.  The potential for low cost, office-based surgical procedures that are more effective than any current technique offers a compelling business model for the anticipated result of this proposal.\r\n\r\n",
