The proposal is submitted on behalf of a consortium of higher education institutions, the state department of education, rural schools, and business and community organizations in Hawai'i and requests $191,764 over twelve months for planning and development activities. \r\n\r\nThe goal is to seek significant and sustainable improvements in standards-based science, mathematics and technology education for students in rural economically and educationally disadvantaged areas of the the state. \r\n\r\nThe objectives include:\r\n\r\nConducting a comprehensive assessment specifically related to the status of science and technology teaching and learning in the state.\r\n\r\nGathering baseline data on student achievement aligned with standards-based instruction.\r\n\r\nBuilding a coalition of support and understanding for a systemic approach to improving practices.\r\n\r\nIncreasing community and business involvement in identifying local resources that need to be converged and aligned.\r\n\r\nExpanding and deepen the use of technology and telecommunications as effective teaching and learning tools.\r\n\r\nGenerating a sustainable implementation plan for systemic reform in science and technology education.\r\n\r\n",
