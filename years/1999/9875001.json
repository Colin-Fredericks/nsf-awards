 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal is the development of novel core-shell functional nanostructures having unique microwave and magnetic properties, which are not available in the bulk.  Applications are sought in communications, computer hardware and magnetic storage systems.  The primary objective is to incorporate metal oxide nanoclusters into the self-assembled nanodomains of ABC triblock copolymer templates, and to fabricate functional nanostructures exhibiting improved magnetic and microwave properties due to the core-shell structure of the nanodomains.  One area of research which will be explored is relevant to the next generation of magnetic storage.  There is currently considerable effort aimed at creating the 100 Gbit per square inch storage systems.  The sizes of individual storage elements in such a memory system are in the range of 50-100 nm.  This approach will enable us to create core-shell magnetic oxide particles, in this size range and confine them into core-shell ABC triblock copolymer nanomorphologies.  The core-shell nanomorphology will result in an enhancement of the coercivity.  The insertion of metal oxide materials into a cheap, manufacturable polymeric matrix would considerably reduce the cost of the functional nanostructured device.  The confinement of colossal magnetoimpedance metallic oxides in a triblock copolymer core-shell nanotemplate can produce a free-standing film, with improved microwave absorption properties.\r\n\r\nThe education activities include undergraduate and graduate teaching, development of a new graduate course in Polymer Synthesis, and significantly improving the content of an undergraduate course in Materials Properties, graduate student advising and various opportunities in undergraduate research involvement and mentoring.  K-12 students will also benefit from education activities in the proposed program, through an interactive web page.\r\n",
