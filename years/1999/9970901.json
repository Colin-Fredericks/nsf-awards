This ``weak convergence\" methodology is applied in several areas.  Stochastic coalescence deals with the merging of particles into larger and larger clusters according to some rate kernel.  The particular case of the additive rate kernel, which has a rich structure relating to continuum random trees, is being investigated in detail.  A novel process combining coalescence with immigration and removal and which appears to have an interesting phase transition is also being studied.  In a different direction, there is increasing interest in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for reconstructing phylogenetic trees (indicating relationships between biological species).  Some toy models for sampling from target distributions on tree-space are studied via the weak convergence methodology.\r\n\r\nThe general area of research concerns large systems with random aspects to their behavior.  As such systems become larger, their behavior gets more difficult to analyze, either via mathematical theory or via computer simulation.  But in some cases it is possible to overcome this difficulty by relating the behavior of sufficiently large finite systems to that of some fixed infinite-size system.  This methodology is being applied in two areas. One area is refining analysis of models of random clustering of mass, a topic of interest in many areas of science (e.g. polymers in physical chemistry, condensation of raindrops in clouds, and formation of galaxies in the early universe).  The other area is the analysis of performance of algorithms for reconstructing relationships between biological species, specifically in how performance scales with number of species.\r\n",
