The primary motivations for and applications of the first part stem from the theory of stationary random processes; namely, from the study of multivariate processes, which dates back to work of Kolmogoroff and Wiener. The theory of matrix weights has many connections with both finite dimensional geometry and noncommutative harmonic analysis. The second part of the project is closely related to problems of geometric measure theory, analytic capacity, partial differential equations, and image processing. The PIs have managed to free the theory of Calderon-Zygmund operators of an unnecessary homogeneity assumption, historically one of the cornerstones of that theory. So far their research has led to many new results in the theory of regularity of multivariate random processes. It has had an impact on geometric measure theory as well. For example, their methods yield an alternative (and rather more streamlined) approach to Guy David's solution of the famous Vitushkin's conjecture that unrectifiable one-dimesional sets have zero analytic capacity.\r\n\r\nA central part of modern harmonic analysis deals with \"singular operators\" of one type or another. Such operators are pervasive in the scientific landscape: they turn up in mathematical physics, probability, engineering, image processing, etc. The expression \"singular operator\" can take many different meanings, but whatever its precise meaning within a given context, the term almost always reflects the fact that only subtle tools can be applied to the investigation of such operators. They are resistant to probing by \"brute force\" methods. In particular, one needs to employ techniques that are sensitive to certain intrinsic cancellations in order to gain control over the singular behavior. So-called Calderon-Zygmund theory appeared in the early 1950s as a first means of coping with singular operators of the type under scrutiny in this project. The PIs broaden this theory in two directions. First, they allow the number of degrees of freedom enjoyed by the operators to increase, thus exposing a whole new kind of cancellation. Second, they make a rather bold move by disgarding one of the basic and, it was earlier thought, indispensible assumptions of the theory. In light of discoveries by the PIs, this assumption (known technically as the homogeneity of the underlying space) seems now to be completely superflous. The PIs' approach has already had several significant consequences: solutions to several long-standing problems, streamlined proofs for other important but difficult results, and the general feature of making complicated arguments much shorter and more lucid.\r\n\r\n",
