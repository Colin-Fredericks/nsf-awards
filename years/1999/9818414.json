The equipment will support experimental research on four projects.  In the first project, machine learning tools will be developed for complex problems such as image analysis and language processing.  These tools will help solve related problems faster and with higher accuracy.  The second project concentrates in developing faster algorithms for complex particle simulations.  These algorithms will make it possible to understand and predict the behavior of chemical compounds in manufacturing (e.g., adhesives, aircraft parts) and environmental cleanup (e.g. contaminant flow in soils).   The third project studies improved techniques for reasoning under uncertainty.  These techniques allow building faster and more accurate systems for real-time diagnosis and repair of complex systems such as automobiles, spacecraft, and factories.  The last project concentrates in developing and applying new methods and tools for program analysis to improve the testing and maintenance of complex software systems.  These tools are expected to reduce the cost and improve the reliability of new and existing software systems.   \r\n",
