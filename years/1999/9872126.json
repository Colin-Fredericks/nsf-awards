 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel computers, particularly shared-memory multiprocessors, are now\r\nwidespread.  However, programmers still have great difficulty exploiting\r\ntheir potential to obtain good performance on real applications. Parallel\r\ncomputing will only be truly successful when this difficulty is removed.\r\nThe investigators attack this problem by statically analyzing programs to\r\ndetermine their structure, embedding run-time measurements to determine\r\ntheir dynamic needs, and triggering adaptive optimization at run-time that\r\nis tuned to those needs.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the investigators and their students plan to explore several\r\ninnovative techniques and/or combinations of known evaluation and\r\noptimization techniques:\r\n\r\n  * Their compiler will insert adaptive capabilities directly into\r\n    applications, rather than going through a third party such as\r\n    the operating system. The application will then monitor its system\r\n    resource usage and control work based on its predicted demands\r\n    and the optimal workload of the system.\r\n\r\n  * They will use a parallel performance model for adaptive\r\n    optimization at run-time. The model will be used to both\r\n    predict execution times for potential optimizations and to\r\n    diagnose computational inefficiencies.\r\n\r\n  * They will implement run-time parallelization and optimization\r\n    techniques and integrate them in the POLARIS compiler and the\r\n    PARASOL system.\r\n\r\n  * They will use run-time parallelization to reduce the impact of\r\n    latency in the applications.\r\n\r\n",
