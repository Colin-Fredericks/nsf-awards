 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's computer simulations and experiments often produce huge amounts of data that need to be seen and interpreted to explain the underlying phenomena. Conventional approaches to this visualization and analysis are likely to fail or have limited scope when used in isolation. A comprehensive end-to-end framework that integrates the data source, storage, servers, network, and the visualization client is critical for delivering scalable performance on a range of hardware platforms and datasets. The complete solution makes it possible to examine vast amounts of data that were never available before, and achieve true understanding of the science that produced the data. In particular, we will examine data from subsurface modeling projects (thus understanding the flow of groundwater and oil reservoirs) and the ASCI program (thus providing insight into advanced physics).\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a framework for interrogative visualization of terascale datasets. The basis of this framework is a suite of compressed multiresolution representation and data streaming techniques that adapt in an error-controlled manner to available computational resources. Used in conjunction with fully threaded visualization servers and clients for parallel performance and 1/0 optimizations for out-of-core computations at both server and client ends, the system should provide seamless scalable performance. This is part of a long-term project at UT Austin to develop a comprehensive framework for multi-scale visualization and simulation for terascale problems, with a tight coupling between modeling, simulation, and visualization. The proposed project deals strictly with progressive interrogative visualization of off line terascale datasets. Other funding will extend the work to support interrogative steering of terascale physical simulations as well. Our primary source of terascale data is from massively parallel physical simulations of time dependent phenomena being performed at the Center for Subsurface Modeling (CSM) at the University of Texas at Austin (UT). To ensure a wider scope and general applicability of our techniques, we will also validate them on terascale simulation data sets made available by researchers at NASA Ames (simulation of supersonic flows), and by the DOE research laboratories (simulation of shock-waves in",
