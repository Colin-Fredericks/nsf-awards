 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the intrinsic and extrinsic magnetic properties of permanent Sm/Nd:Fe/Co:N magnet films made via reactive rf co-sputtering for fine control of alloy composition. Reactive sputtering also allows precise in-situ insertion of nitrogen interstitials to enhance magnetic properties, such as elevated Curie temperatures, while reducing the number of processing steps. The effect of microstructural features, such as grain size and secondary phases, on the magnetic properties will be investigated. These features will be controlled through processing parameters, such as forward power, sputtering pressure, and substrate temperature, as well as through substitutional alloying additions such as Mo, Ti, V, Zr, Cu and C. An important aspect of the project is the clarification of phase diagrams and resulting microstructure-property relationships of sputtered compounds, which may vary substantially from equilibrium values.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. This research has relevance to magnetic recording media, microelectromechanical systems, microsensors, micromotors and integrated isolators and circulators in photonic integrated circuits as well as monolithic microwave integrated circuits. The project also aims to enhance undergraduate, graduate, and underrepresented student research and to develop undergraduate and graduate courses in the area of thin film processing and optoelectronics. This project will also enhance the PI's current activities in K-12 outreach. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). \r\n***\r\n",
