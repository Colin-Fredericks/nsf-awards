The Principal Investigator proposes to continue\r\nhis investigations in ring theory (algebra/mathematics), concentrating on\r\nthe structure of quantum coordinate algebras (quantized algebras of\r\nfunctions), noetherian rings, and related rings. The main focus will be\r\non the structure of the prime and primitive spectra of quantum algebras.\r\nThe goals include classification of prime ideals, finiteness conditions\r\nfor prime ideals invariant under tori of automorphisms, verification of\r\nsupporting properties such as Auslander-regularity, Cohen-Macaulayness,\r\nand normal separation (crucial to proving catenarity and investigating\r\nlinks), and presentations of quantized prime or primitive spectra as\r\ntopological quotients of classical spectra or varieties.\r\n\r\nAbstract. Spurred by developments in theoretical physics involving\r\nquantum analogs of enveloping algebras of Lie algebras and coordinate\r\nrings of algebraic varieties, the theory of quantum algebras has rapidly\r\nexpanded, and numerous mathematicians have become involved in it.\r\nAlthough certain similarities between quantum algebras and their\r\nclassical predecessors are evident and others have surfaced in the\r\nmeantime, new perspectives need to be found, and new tools developed to\r\nunderstand these algebras more fully. This proposal concentrates on\r\nquantum coordinate rings (as opposed to quantized enveloping algebras)\r\nand classes of quantum algebras exhibiting related behavior.\r\nSufficiently many common phenomena have been discovered in a wide range\r\nof algebras of the above type to lead one to conjecture that general,\r\naxiomatizable underpinnings within this class of algebras are\r\nresponsible for the parallels in their behavior. The main long-term\r\nthrust of the research is to uncover and describe such general\r\nstructures. In the medium term, the proposal aims to extend the range of\r\nknown shared phenomena within this class of algebras, in order to gain\r\nbetter insight into their common base.\r\n",
