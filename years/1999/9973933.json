 "awd_abstract_narration": "9973933\r\nVold\r\n\r\nNanocomposites are a novel class of materials whose microscopic architecture is controlled by design over distance scales from tens to hundreds of nanometers.  These spatial dimensions are larger than those\r\nrelevant to ordinary chemical synthesis, but much smaller than those accessible by macroscopic engineering techniques.  Nanocomposite materials often exhibit exciting new properties which arise from their special architecture, but their synthesis is still largely a matter of trial and error.  In part, this arises because techniques for characterizing nanostructures need to be improved.  In particular, while many techniques can reveal geometric features of nanostructures, there are not many techniques available for studying molecular motion in these complex materials.\r\n\r\nBy focusing attention on specific materials which have potentially important technological applications, the proposed work will illustrate the practical utility of solid state NMR as a tool to aid tailoring the properties of composite materials to achieve specific design goals.  Two representative projects are discussed in detail, one dealing with polymer/clay nanocomposites and other with dendridic polymers.  One novel aspect of the proposed work is it's emphasis on molecular motion.  This is important because bulk material properties such as strength, toughness, resistance to thermal and chemical degradation, and chemical selectivity are all dependent not only on  static structure, morphology and supramolecular architecture, but also on the microscopic mobility of the molecular subunits.  The work described in this proposal will apply modern techniques of solid state nuclear magnetic resonance as a tool for characterizing both structure and dynamics in nanocomposites.  This is important because a detailed understanding of both static structure and molecular dynamics is needed to guide the rational design of new materials with optimized macroscopic properties.\r\n",
