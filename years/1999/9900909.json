Naval Postgraduate School\r\nBasic Research in Information Privacy\r\n\r\nNew models of information privacy are needed if we ever expect to make proving security in real systems practical.  Traditional approaches treat privacy as a safety or information-flow property, the former being common among protocols and the latter among systems.  Yet neither approach is adequate.  Safety is too weak to reject some obvious privacy violations and information flow is too strong to admit some useful systems.  Among them are those whose security rests on parameters like the randomness and length of a secret.  Further, new design principles are needed to guide in building real systems that exhibit the new properties.  The research investigates practical models of information privacy and conditions under which they always hold in programs.  New techniques are investigated for proving privacy in practical systems and their implementations.\r\n",
