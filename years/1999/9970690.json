The research impacts systems far from equilibrium, biological materials, pattern formation processes during phase transitions, and aspects of high temperature superconductivity.  In addition, there is special emphasis on the development of analytic renormalization group methods and novel simulation tools to bridge the gap between microscopic physics and macroscopic behavior.  This project advances current understanding in the areas of materials processing and the behavior of complicated materials, and the methodology is broadly applicable to systems with a complex interplay of length- and time-scales.  By working at the intersection of materials science, theoretical physics and applied mathematics, students and postdocs associated with this research receive a unique training in the applications of renormalization group theory and the development of novel computational algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis is an award for a theoretical investigation of a wide variety of systems of relevance to materials research.
