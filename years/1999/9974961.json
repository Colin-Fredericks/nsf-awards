This hemoglobin is probably the only heme protein that carries out its function, to transport H2S to a bacteria symbion, in a hydrogen-sulfide bound ferric state.  The presence of H-bonding between the heme-Fe+3 SH2 moiety and the Gln(E7) group is postulated to stabilize the HbISH2 center.  Likewise, other amino groups, in particular, Gln(E7),  Phe(B10), and Phe(E11)  may interact with other HbI ligands, CO and O2.   In order to understand the structural and functional characteristics of this enzyme, site-directed mutants  of HbI will be used to  determine its association and dissociation constants with different ligands as a function of pH.  These studies in conjunction with the FTIR and resonance Raman work should produce new insight about factors that control H2S binding, transport, and delivery. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to study the ligand affinity differences in heme proteins.  At present, it is not established whether these differences arise from electrostatic effects, from steric constraints, or from hydrogen-bonding differences.  It is hoped that the these studies with hemoglobin I from Lucina pectinata will resolve some of these issues and produce new insight about the structural and functional characteristics of this unusual hemoglobin.  The work is likely to produce information that may be useful in the design of  recombinant HbI proteins with commercial uses, for example, as a specific H2S biosensor.  These proteins may also be used for the removal of toxic H2S from industrial or natural processes, such as anaerobic fermentation, sewage, and natural gas production.\r\n",
