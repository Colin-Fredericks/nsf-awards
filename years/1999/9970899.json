The objects of study are related to wave equations, to Fourier integral, restriction and maximal operators and to eigenfunctions of pseudo-differential operators on compact manifolds. The first set of problems are of a discrete nature in the sense that properties of integer lattice points are crucial to them and are exploited by methods for exponential sums such as the Hardy-Littlewood method. The underlying space is the flat torus or its dual, the set of lattice points itself. Similar problems are considered in the settings of a smooth manifold, the usual \"curvature\" conditions replaced by assuming only that the objects are typical (generic) elements of the family. Techniques of singularity theory are brought into play to establish decay properties of the corresponding oscillatory integrals.\r\n\r\nIn more general terms, this project focuses on problems of analysis that stem from partial differential equations of fundamental importance in nature; namely, the Schrodinger equation governing the evolution of states of physical systems at microscopic scales and the wave equation describing the propagation of light and acoustic waves. The project aims especially at those situations where purely analytic techniques seem to be inadequate and deeper understanding can be achieved only by incorporating methods and results from different fields of mathematics, analytic number theory and singularity theory to name just two. Classical harmonic analysis has been a very succesful mathematical tool for describing the aforementioned physical phenomena but is completely effective in rather restricted circumstances. The proposed project is part of a vast program that has been implemented over the past three decades to enrich the classical theory and to extend its range of applicability\r\n",
