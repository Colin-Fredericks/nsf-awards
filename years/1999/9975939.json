 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Joseph O'Connor of the University of California - San Diego will pursue an investigation of the synthesis, structural elucidation, and mechanistic aspects of the formation and reactions of metallacyclobutene complexes. Even though these species play important roles in a number of metal-mediated transformations, there are relatively few well characterized examples. Thus, new synthetic routes will be devised for late-transition metallacyclobutene complexes. These compounds will be used for structural studies, well defined reactivity studies, the development of new reactions, and the modeling of key steps in reactions that are thought to involve metallacyclobutene intermediates. In addition to uncovering new synthetic approaches to and applications of these complexes, the proposed studies will address stereocontrol of their synthesis and reactions.\r\n\r\nThis project involves investigations of the preparation and reactivity of a class of organometallic compound known as metallacyclobutenes. The examples of interest for these studies contain late transition elements. The major objective is the development of new synthetic methods that may be used in total synthesis of natural products and their homologs. As such, the new methods will be valuable to the preparation of pharmaceuticals.\r\n",
