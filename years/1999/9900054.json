 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support exploratory research on the potential for genetic modification of Indian mustard to increase the rate at which it can extract selenium from soil contaminated with selenium.  This plant species is moderately tolerant of selenium in soil and grows rapidly.  If it can be genetically modified to become a hyperaccumulater of selenium it could potentially be used to remove selenium from contaminated soil.  In this project, the investigator will be exploring the potential applicability of using the enhanced, modified capability of this plant species under greenhouse and field conditions to determine its potential applicability for use in decontamination of agricultural soil. \r\n\r\nThe proposal leading to this award was submitted to NSF under the Special Guidelines for an SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory Research) in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (NSF 99-2).  Results of this research are expected to provide the basis for determining whether genetic modification of a plant species to increase its ability to extract selenium from selenium-contaminated soil, should be further considered for potential use in engineering design of procedures to remove pollutants from soil.  Results may also determine the nature of further research that would be needed to explore this and related concepts for prevention of groundwater pollution from chemically contaminated soil.\r\n\r\n",
