The goal is to verify, more automatically, larger systems than is possible by either technique alone.  The proposed techniques feature a tight integration of abstraction techniques and modular verification; they include: (1) Modular Deductive Model Checking: environmental assumptions needed to complete modular proofs are derived as part of the proof.  (2) Modular Abstraction and Invariant Generation:  invariants of modules are generated based on abstractions with different classes of assumptions on their environment. (3) Modular Techniques for Hybrid Systems: assumptions are generated for a continuously evolving environment.  The proposed research will allow the partial verification of open systems, before their components are fully specified or their environment is known. Since these methods require less interaction, it is feasible to perform more checks on early versions of a system being designed.  The techniques will be applicable to general infinite-state reactive systems.  In particular, they will be applied to the challenging problems posed by hybrid systems. The techniques will be implemented in the framework of the STeP (Stanford Temporal Prover) \r\nverification system, and used to verify a complex hybrid system as a case study.\r\n",
