 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the acquisition of equipment, supplies and travel needed to improve the Texas A&M \r\nUniversity Insect Collection (TAMUIC)-a major insect research collection of approximately 1.55 million curated specimens with regional strengths in the south-central and southwestern U.S. and Mexico.  Specifically, the project will relocate and incorporate the orphaned Johnson Bruchid Collection into the TAMUIC Coleoptera collection, and  (2) replace non-standard/substandard cabinets used to house portions of the TAMUIC pinned collection as part of a long-term plan to install a compactor system in the TAMUIC to accommodate future growth.\r\n\r\nThe Johnson Bruchid Collection contains representatives of approximately 1000 bruchid species(ca.2/3 of\r\nthe 1500 world species of this group) and is one of the most important collections of New World seed beetles ever assembled.  The collection was built by Dr. Clarence D. \"Dan. \"Johnson, former Professor of Biological Sciences of the Department of Biological Sciences at Northern Arizona University(NAU).  Over the past 35 years, Dr. Johnson has been one of the two dominant figures in New World bruchid systematics.  The collection contains an estimated 200,000-250,000 specimens.  The collection has been orphaned at NAU since Dr. Johnson's retirement in 1994, and was formally offered to the TAMUIC for permanent deposition in June of 1998.\r\n\r\n338,500 (21.9%) of the TAMUIC's 1.55 million specimens have been added to the collection during the last five years.  This substantial rate of growth has been the result of the collective efforts of a dedicated group of collection-associated faculty, staff, students and friends who are committed to the continued development of the TAMUIC as a central resource for the support of entomological systematics.  The rapid growth of recent years shows no sign of slowing, and has spurred the development of a strategic plan by collection curators to accommodate future growth within the relatively static space currently allocated to the collection.  This plan calls for the eventual installation of a compactor system in the TAMUIC's main collection room, and, in preparation for this installation, the replacement of certain non-standard collection storage equipment that are impediments to efficient compactor storage.  Much of this equipment also contains structural defects which impedes its proper functioning in the collection.  This project will also support the replacement of non-standard and substandard insect cabinets currently used to store portions of the TAMUIC pinned collection.  Following this replacement, all pinned materials in the TAMUIC will be housed in secure, modern, steel cabinets and will be ready for installation on a compactor system.",
