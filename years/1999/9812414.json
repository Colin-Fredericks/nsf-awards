 "awd_abstract_narration": "A symmetric building (buildings with irregular distribution of mass, and/or stiffness, and/or strengths in their floor plans) is especially vulnerable to earthquakes.  The primary objective of the research project is to develop the background and guidelines necessary to improve seismic performance of asymmetric buildings by using supplemental damping.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of research will focus on buildings with non-ductile structural elements (beams, columns, walls etc.) that can be allowed to experience no damage or very limited damage, i.e., buildings that must respond in or close to the linearly elastic range of behavior. This is an important class.  Many older buildings in high seismic regions like California (designed prior to the development of modern seismic codes) as well as most newer buildings in low to moderate seismic regions like central and eastern U.S. of all in this category.  The second phase will focus on buildings with ductile structural elements, i.e., buildings that may be permitted to respond in the inelastic range of behavior but the element demands (displacement, ductility, or energy) must focus on proof-of-concept experiments using large scale models of asymmetric buildings with supplemental damping devices.  At present, funding is being provided for first two of the three phases; funding for the final phase would be requested after successful completion of the first two phases.\r\n\r\nThe investigation undertaken will enable the development of improved methods for seismic protection of asymmetric buildings, a class that is especially vulnerable to earthquakes but not always possible to avoid.  The guidelines and simplified design procedures that will result from the proposed research would also lead to improvements in performance-based seismic standards such as FEMA-273.\r\n   \r\n\r\n",
