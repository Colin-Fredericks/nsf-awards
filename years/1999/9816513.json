 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program will enable the Chemistry Department at the University of Chicago to purchase a combination fluorescence and Brewster angle microscope/Langmuir trough instrument.  This equipment will be used primarily by junior faculty member Ka Yee C. Lee, whose research focuses on the study of lipid-protein interactions at interfaces; interactions between proteins and lung surfactant-specific lipids; and the role of membrane lipids in the aggregation of amyloid beta peptides.  \r\n\r\nDr. Lee's research, which involves surface chemical investigations of the interactions of surface-active peptides with lipid monolayers at the air-water interface, has considerable practical merit as well as fundamental significance.  The applications are sure to yield interesting new knowledge regarding important biological systems.   In addition, it is quite likely that the results will be highly relevant to lung diseases involving premature infants and emphysema; thus, there should be a significant beneficial effect on society at large.",
