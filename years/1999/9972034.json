The basic idea of domain decomposition \r\nin this context is to decouple the global optimality system through an \r\niterative procedure on individual elements, in which the couplings at the \r\nvertices and/or edges are replaced by certain boundary conditions. At each \r\niteration the local problems, which are themselves local optimality \r\nsystems, may be solved in parallel.  The choice of boundary conditions in \r\nthe local problems must be such that, in particular, the transmission \r\nconditions in the global optimality system are restored in the limit of the \r\niterations. The motivation for this approach is twofold. On the one hand, \r\ncontrollability properties and optimal control laws are more readily \r\navailable at the local, subdomain, level.  Consequently, there is good \r\nreason to believe that it may be possible to construct suitable control laws \r\nfor the global system by local iterations, even in situations where such \r\ncontrol properties are not a priori known at the global level. On the other \r\nhand, and perhaps more importantly, the approach is motivated by its \r\nnumerical potential. Complex, heterogeneous structures or media, after \r\nsome discretization, inevitably lead to very large systems to be solved \r\nnumerically. The transmission conditions in the global problems, which of \r\ncourse must be also realized numerically, are very difficult to handle \r\nnumerically at the global level.  It is very natural, therefore, to decompose \r\nsuch structures into their canonical constituents, to discretize those and \r\nthen run the computations in parallel with the communications between \r\nelements taking place once an iteration step is completed.\r\n\r\nIn many practical applications it is necessary to devise control laws to \r\nregulate the dynamic behavior of structures such as trusses, frames, robot \r\narms, solar panels, antennae, airfoils or deformable mirrors that are \r\ncomprised of multiple  interconnected flexible elements such as beams, \r\nmembranes, plates, shells or combinations thereof. This research will \r\nexplore optimal control, approximate controllability, and exact \r\ncontrollability of such structures by means of domain decomposition. The \r\nbasic idea of domain decomposition in this context is to devise optimal \r\ncontrol laws for the global structure through iterations of optimal control \r\nlaws on individual elements. At each iteration the local control laws may \r\nbe simultaneously obtained through parallel computations.  The  \r\nmotivation for this approach is twofold. On the one hand, controllability \r\nproperties and optimal control laws are more readily available for \r\nindividual flexible elements. Consequently, there is good reason to believe \r\nthat it may be possible to construct optimal control laws for the global \r\nstructure by iterations on individual control laws, even in situation where \r\nsuch control properties are not a priori known at the global level. On the \r\nother hand, and perhaps more importantly, the approach is motivated by \r\nits numerical potential. Complex, heterogeneous structures or media, after \r\nsome discretization, lead to very large systems to be solved numerically. \r\nThe coupling conditions among individual elements that comprise the \r\nglobal structure are very difficult to handle numerically at the global level.  \r\nIt is very natural, therefore, to decompose such structures into their \r\ncanonical constituents, to discretize those and the then run the \r\ncomputations in parallel with the communications between elements  \r\ntaking place once an iteration step is completed.\r\n",
