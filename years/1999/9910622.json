 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Website, E-CEPT,  is being established  and administered to serve as an electronic network that coordinates and promotes undergraduate science/math education reforms. E-CEPT provides vital and efficient links across the 17 geographically distributed NSF Collaboratives for the Excellence in Teacher Preparation (CETP), and among the more than 1000 science/math and science/math education faculty directly involved in the CETP programs. E-CEPT serves as an NSF gateway for directing any faculty interested in undergraduate science/math education reforms to high quality web-based information, including digital libraries.\r\n\r\nThe E-CEPT website contains two components: 1) a Portal and 2) a Forum. The Portal points users to other websites containing undergraduate science/math education reform information and materials, and features a search engine with access to a CEPT specific database continuously monitored and updated with links to frontline undergraduate science/math education reform information. The E-CEPT Forum promotes online interaction among CETP faculty and others interested in science and math teacher preparation reforms.\r\n",
