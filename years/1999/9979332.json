Pezold, of the Department of Biological Sciences at Northeast Louisiana University, to travel to Mali to meet with Dr. Mamadou Diallo Iam, General Director of the National Centre for Scientific and Technological Research, as well as with representatives from other Malian research organizations and the US Agency for International Development.  The purpose of the visit is to finalize plans for a joint workshop on \"Upper Niger River Corridor Ecology and Conservation.\"  \r\n\r\nThe Niger River is one of the largest rivers in the world, and it supports a variety of riparian and aquatic ecosystems, many of which are endemic to the region.  It also supplies the region with the majority its water for agriculture and human consumption.  Today, many of its biologically diverse ecosystems are being threatened by desertification from the Sahel, pollution, and the competing needs of wildlife and human populations.  The proposed workshop will establish conservation priorities for the Upper Niger River Corridor and identify areas of interest for multi-national collaborative research projects.     \r\n",
