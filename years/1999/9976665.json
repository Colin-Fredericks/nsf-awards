 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support theoretical research on condensed matter physics which is concerned with explaining and predicting the physical properties of a number of interesting electron systems which are currently subjects of experimental studies, and, in their realization in new materials, of  technological promise.  In general, what distinguishes the systems to be studied is that their behavior is largely determined by the fact that the interaction between the electrons is unusually strong, indeed often the largest energy of the electron system in question.  From the experimental point of view, this leads to unusual behavior in thermodynamic and transport properties.  At the same time, the presence of the strong electron-electron correlations often requires new theoretical approaches and techniques.  In this project, various strong-correlation systems will be studied theoretically using methods based primarily on the methods of quantum statistical mechanics.  Thus the research to be carried out has both intrinsic theoretical importance and immediate experimental relevance.  The research will impact materials science, solid state physics and quantum chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe materials to be investigated include new strongly correlated metals, especially those showing metal-insulator transitions, high temperature and other unconventional superconductors, disordered electronic substances, and quantum solids and liquids.  In all of these subjects, the interactions between elementary constituents play a fundamental role.  The theoretical approach will introduce and elaborate models and methods which deal directly with that central issue.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award will support theoretical research on condensed matter physics which is concerned with explaining and predicting the physical properties of a number of interesting electron systems which are currently subjects of experimental studies, and, in their realization in new materials, of  technological promise.
