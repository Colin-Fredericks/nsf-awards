 "awd_abstract_narration": "Self-similar behavior is evident in many physical systems including\r\nthe rupture of thin films, the pinching of thin liquid threads or\r\nsolid necks, and the spreading of liquid drops.  This research seeks\r\nto increase the understanding of self-similarity by viewing the mathematical \r\nmodels for these phenomena in the context of dynamical systems theory.\r\nSelf-similar solutions can be thought of as steady equilibria in a\r\nrescaled coordinate system that is \"zooming\" to match the scale of\r\nthe phenomena. Most of these models have an infinite number of\r\nself-similar solutions. The foremost goal of this project is the\r\ndevelopment of a stability theory that will identify which solution is\r\ndynamically selected by the model.\r\n\r\nThe ideas developed in this project will provide mathematicians,\r\nengineers and physicists with a set of tools for analyzing\r\nself-similar dynamics. A phenomenon is self-similar if it appears to be \r\nunchanging once the time scale is suitably accelerated or slowed down \r\nand the spatial scale is also adjusted. For example, integrated circuits rely on the\r\ndeposition of thin metallic traces on a substrate; this research\r\nwill help determine when these traces will break during fabrication\r\nand elucidate the details of how the break occurs, since there is often self-similar\r\nbehavior near the critical event.  Thin fluid films are created in the application \r\nof paint, adhesives and optical coatings; the techniques developed in this \r\nproject should describe when and how films rupture and help devise \r\nstrategies for preventing these defects, which often develop in a self-similar way.  \r\nThis grant will also underwrite the research of Harvey Mudd \r\nCollege undergraduates who will become an integral part of this investigation.\r\n\r\n",
