 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861127\r\n\tThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I  project from RSK Assessments, Inc. will develop a computerized battery to assess effects on workers of different stressor environments, including toxic ones, on human performance and human well being.  One limitation of current test batteries has been that different results may be obtained on the same test battery when it is implemented on different hardware.  One of the goals of the current proposal is to eliminate such variability across different interfaces.  The project will need to develop newer software systems (e.g., Windows), with tests implemented on several modern systems (desk top, lap top, palm top, etc.) which will permit satisfactory answers regarding psychological comparability (factor structure, means and standard deviations, etc.) of tests on different systems.  Building on RSK Assessments' cognitive battery which is reliable, stable and sensitive to various agents, the firm will broaden that battery to include visual and psychomotor tests and program it in a modern language in order to permit easy translation from raw data to analysis.  The Phase I research entails reprogramming these batteries, administering them to a large sample under graded dosages of alcohol in order to evaluate sensitivity and other metrics, and examining equipment differences.\r\n\tThis project proffers a sensitive, marketable computerized assessment battery which samples multiple cognitive domains and that has wide value for the military and commercial communities in which the monitoring of human performance capabilities is important.\r\n",
