 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: DMS-9970363\r\nPrincipal Investigator: Alexander M. Blokh\r\n\r\nAbstract: Blokh plans to describe Milnor attractors for certain rational functions, to determine their conformal measures, and to use the new notion of a growing tree as a tool for studying dynamics on the Julia set (jointly with Misiurewicz and Levin). In one-dimensional dynamics, Blokh and Misiurewicz introduced the notion of super-persistent recurrence. The lack of such recurrence at a point is a mild expanding property. This behavior implies recent results by Blokh and Misiurewicz according to which wild attractors with negative Schwarzian derivatives are super-persistently recurrent and limit sets of critical points in a dense family of smooth interval maps are minimal. Blokh intends to use this device to study further properties of attractors and stability for smooth interval maps. He also hopes to extend the rotation theory to graph maps and then study forcing among periodic orbit portraits.\r\n\r\nMany processes in biology, the physical sciences, and economics can be modeled by dynamical systems. Studying these models allows one to draw valid conclusions about the processes themselves and their long-term behavior. This project is aimed at studying a variety of such dynamical systems. Blokh intends to verify that either the behavior of the system is on average chaotic (but almost the same for the majority of initial conditions) or it coincides with the behavior of systems starting at a special finite set of so-called critical initial conditions. Also, a system is said to behave periodically if the same conditions recur with the same frequency all the time (e.g., the motion of the planets about the sun). Periodic dynamics are easier to study than more general motions, which is why it is important to understand periodic systems as fully as possible before probing the mysteries of more complicated systems. Blokh wishes to characterize all periodic behaviors of dynamical systems using only finitely many parameters. The results obtained will help to describe the possible outcomes for a variety of processes and to explain the prevalence of certain types of processes in both theoretical settings and the natural world.\r\n",
