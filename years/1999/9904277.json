The student, a native Macedonian speaker, will examine the ethnic identity of both groups through a study of the home furnishings preferred by each.  Using in-depth ethnographic research on a small sample of households followed by an extensive survey of 180 households, 90 from each nationality, the student will examine the change from the pre-1991 Communist Yugoslav Federation to the current Macedonian situation.  Anti-Albanian nationalism is currently a strong force in the region, and this study will help reveal the cultural roots of the antagonism by comparing the previous condition under which both groups lived peacefully, subjected to a dominant Communist ideology which focused on cross-cutting class differences and working class solidarity, to the current situation which separates people by culture and religion (Orthodox versus Muslim). The student will test the hypothesis that home furnishings were not that different in the pre 1991 condition, but difference flourished afterwards as the ethnic tensions became free to grow.  This project is important because it will advance our understanding of the meanings of nationalist/ethnic antagonism in this one case, which is comparable to many other situations in the post-Communist world.  In addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist. \r\n",
