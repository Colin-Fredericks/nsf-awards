Alice will open in early 2001, first in San Jose and subsequently at mid-size children's museums and science centers across the country.  It is projected that over the four years of traveling this exhibition around the United States, a target audience of more than two million people will view the project.  The target audience for the exhibition is young children age 3-8 years old, with an emphasis on attracting girls and minorities, populations traditionally underserved in science and mathematics, together with their parents and teachers.  \r\n\r\nAlice takes the link between curiosity and explanation as its rationale, using its eponymous heroine's dream-adventure as a framework for activities that will help children and adults build a shared foundation for mathematics and science literacy.\r\n\r\nThe designer for the project will be Koem Liem, a recognized exhibit developer.  \r\n",
