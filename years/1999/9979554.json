This goals of this GK-12 Project include:  1) communicating SMET content, applications, and career paths to students and teachers in the Oxford and Lafayette County school districts; 2) providing the location and/or development of a growing supply of high quality SMET instructional activities, laboratory exercises, software, and demonstrations to expand and enhance the educational practices in use by K-12 teachers and students; and 3) increasing the ability of the teachers and Fellows to effectively utilize technology as a means to enhance the education of the students.\r\nThe school districts are benefiting from the variety of newly developed materials, the increased ability to effectively utilize technology in the educational process, and the meaningful interaction between teachers, students, and the Fellows. Benefits to the Fellows include a better understanding of pedagogical best-practices, and an increased understanding of the various student needs. Benefits to The University of Mississippi include the recruitment of excellent Fellows, better relationships with the local schools, and improved communications between SMET related departments.\r\n",
