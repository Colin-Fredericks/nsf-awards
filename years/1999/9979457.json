 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Multihop wireless capabilities will enable communication and coordination among autonomous nodes in unplanned environments and configurations.  At the same time wireless channels present challenges of dynamic operating conditions, power constraints for autonomously-powered nodes, and complicating interactions between high level behavior and lower level channel characteristics (e.g. , increased synchronized communication will significantly degrade channel characteristics).  The major goal of the research  is the development, testing and characterization of algorithms for scalable, application driven, wireless network services using a heterogeneous collection of communicating mobile nodes.   Some of these nodes will be autonomous (robots) in that their movements will not be human controlled.   The others will be portable thus, making them dependent on humans for transportation.   While the focus of the work is on the mobile nodes, include immobile computers on the network as well.   It emphasize that most (though not all)\r\nof the mobile nodes will have modest sensing, computational and communication resources.  The collection as a whole is an example of a sensor network.  The chief scientific motivation behind the work is the design of robust, efficient and scalable algorithms.   The researchers hypothesize that distributed algorithms that rely on local interactions have many compelling characteristics, resulting in these properties.   There is significant overlap between the problems of coordinating the autonomous mobile nodes that carry some of the sensors and the algorithms that direct the f ow of information from source(s) to sink(s) in the network.   Both setsof algorithms will be carefully designed to improve robustness, effciency and scalability.",
