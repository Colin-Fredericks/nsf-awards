Giedroc\r\nTexas A&M University\r\nHigh Field NMR Instrumentation for Structural Studies of Proteins and Nucleic Acids\r\n\r\nThis grant supports the acquisition of a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Texas A&M. The spectrometer will significantly enhance the study of protein and nucleic acid structure and dynamics at Texas A&M.  Projects that will benefit from the new spectrometer include:  (1) investigation of the structure and dynamics of proteins that regulate gene expression, (2) investigation of the structure and dynamics of chemokines that are related to HIV, (3) studies concerning the structure, thermodynamics, and metal ion binding of catalytic RNA molecules, (4) studies focused on hydrogen bonds in proteins and nucleic acids, (5) de novo design and characterization of proteins, and (6) the analysis of conformations of peptides containing elements that mimic the turns found in proteins.  None of these studies can be accomplished using the spectrometers currently available to researchers at Texas A&M.\r\n\r\nIn addition to having a significant impact on research at Texas A&M, the 600 MHz spectrometer is also expected to have an impact on training students.  The new spectrometer will become part of the Biomolecular NMR facility.  This facility provides  postgraduate, graduate, and undergraduate students with access to high field NMR equipment.  Students from three different departments use this facility.  The addition of a 600 MHz spectrometer will significantly expand the training of students in the area of macromolecular structure and dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
