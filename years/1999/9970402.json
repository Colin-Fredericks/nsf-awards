 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT - 9970402\r\nThe microscopy of living processes has undergone a minor renaissance in recent years. Of particular importance has been the use of genetic and microinjected fluorescent probes to track and tease apart dynamic processes in living cells and tissues. In this grant, funds have been provided by the National Science Foundation to purchase a state-of-the-art microinjection and microscope imaging system.  This equipment will be used by basic science researchers at the College of Charleston, Medical University of South Carolina and NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center. The projects include applications in genetic analysis of green fluorescent protein expression in living zebrafish embryos; following migratory behavior of fluorescently tagged cells in tissue culture; dynamic measurement of cell-to-cell communication in developmental processes; and fluorescent tracking of toxins in developing fish embryos. The interdisciplinary groups using this equipment have proven commitments to education and strong records of providing opportunities for young people to experience work in a professional research environment.  These include students at all levels from high school to post-doctoral trainees-with special emphasis on encouraging minority participation in science. This grant by the NSF will contribute significantly to scientific research and education infrastructure in the Charleston, South Carolina area.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
