 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER project involves an analysis and comparison of Japanese elementary school teacher materials in mathematics.  The PI, Dr. Tad Watanabe of Towson University, will analyze the overall structure of the teacher materials in the content areas of number and operations, geometry, and algebra using the United States Department of Education's criteria for Promising and Exemplary Programs.  The analysis involves the two most popular programs in Japan and two American programs, one that has been NSF-supported and another published program.  The proposal notes the impact of the TIMSS results and seeks to address the questions of teaching differences through this analysis and comparison.  The purpose of this investigation, however, is not to evaluate or assess Japanese and American teacher materials, but to report how such materials are organized and to determine how consistent they are with the way mathematics is taught.",
