 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Identity politics\"--defining interests and organizing politically on the basis of one's membership in an identity community--has become a hallmark of American politics in the last quarter of a century. When identity groups become powerful and established, their definitions of community interests may come to be seen as the only legitimate ones. If established and powerful groups and institutions representing an identity community define that community's interests in one way, how does an organization within the community with opposite views assert itself? This research will study the formation of collective identity in \"heretical social movement organizations\" (HSMO) by analyzing how such groups frame their issues in relation to identity community antagonists, protagonists, and audience members, and non-identity community antagonists, protagonists, and audience members. The content of HSMO newsletters, press releases, brochures, speeches, and public statements reported in the press will be analyzed, and structured, open-ended interviews with 75 leaders and activists of the HSMOs also will be conducted. HSMOs are important for the study of social movements and collective identity, as their existence or nonexistence points directly to issues of legitimacy of representation of movement organizations. They also raise the basic question of who can speak on behalf of a given group, and how a group takes a position contrary to its presumed interests and values. By addressing these questions, this research will serve to refine existing social movement concepts and theories by applying them to situations which have not been conceived of in the literature. Second, this research will identify the processes by which community interests and collective identities may be redefined and transformed. Third, the research will generate new knowledge about the alliance structures of social movement organizations, including what kinds of alliance structures are most conducive to social movvement organizations' success.",
