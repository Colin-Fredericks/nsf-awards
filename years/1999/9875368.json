 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visualization - the visual representation of information through images -\r\nis vital in a broad range of scientific and medical applications. A good\r\nvisualization conveys the essential information in a complex dataset\r\nclearly and effectively, emphasizing important features and minimizing\r\nextraneous detail. The usefulness of a particular visualization technique\r\ncan be quantified in terms of the extent to which it improves task\r\nperformance for a given application.  This makes it possible to compare\r\ndifferent methods or to pick optimal parameter values for a given method.\r\nThe process of designing an effective visualization, however, remains for\r\nthe most part a black art, terribly ad hoc, largely guided by intuition.\r\nThe PI's research is a quest for a deeper understanding of the science\r\nbehind this art, guided by theoretical and experimental insights from human\r\nvisual perception.  This can be used to enhance all computer interfaces\r\nthat use elements studied here.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the focus of the research is to investigate\r\nperceptually-based methods for more effectively conveying the\r\nthree-dimensional shape and relative depth of smoothly curving surfaces in\r\nscientific datasets. Key applications for this work include the\r\nvisualization of superimposed isovalue surfaces in 3D scalar fields, and\r\nthe combined visualization of external and internal structures in medicine\r\nand CAD. The investigator will begin by using controlled observer\r\nexperiments to thoroughly evaluate texture as a device for enhancing the\r\nperception of shape. This will identify and quantify the key aspects of\r\ntexture in interface design. The investigator will also pursue the\r\nautomatic generation of non-photorealistic, pen-and-ink style\r\nrepresentations of arbitrary polygonally-defined objects for interactive applications. \r\nThe advantage of such techniques is that some datasets need to be represented in a more\r\nsubtly indicative style than traditional graphics renderings. Complementing\r\nthe research component of this project is an educational component,\r\ndirected at both undergraduate and graduate students, aimed at inspiring\r\ninterest and fostering creativity through hands-on experiences in\r\nvisualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
