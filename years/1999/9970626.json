The first is to attain a deeper understanding of representations of p-adic groups by studying the behavior of affine Hecke algebras under extension of scalars. It appears that such algebras will completely control the representation theory of p-adic groups. The second project is to investigate an explicit family of highest weight vectors in tensor products of representations of GLn. These appear to be the first such explicitly given family. The main question is, whether they in\r\nfact span the space of all highest weight vectors.\r\n\r\nRepresentation theory is a major mathematical technique for exploiting the presence of symmetry. For example, the structure of the hydrogen atom, one of the fundamental computations in quantum mechanics, is controlled by representation theory. Another way of thinking about representation theory is as a generalization of the theory of eigenvalues and matrices that many people see in a college course on basic linear algebra. This project addresses two important questions in representation theory. One potentially has important applications to number theory. The other concerns a generalization of the  theory of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. It will help describe how  pair  of interacting quantum  mechanical systems of a rather general type  breaks up into simpler systems.\r\n",
