They would access data files (including especially the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) and the Luxembourg Employment Study (LES)), and work collaboratively with their European peers on projects of a common interest related to topics such as income structures and income dynamics; ethnic and social inequality; regional development; labor markets and employment; issues related to aging populations; structural economic change; and gender and child poverty.  Researchers would interact with others sharing similar interests and would also be instructed in accessing the multinational cross-sectional and panel datasets available at CEPS. Researchers would continue their work once the visit was ended, returning to present their papers at subsequent meetings and seminars, and providing working papers that will be made available free via the LIS/LES website, as are all LIS/LES working papers. The specific program that funding is requested for is the International Research Infrastructure in the Socio-economic Sciences (IRISS) Program at CEPS which is funded by the European Commission Directorate XII's Large Scale Facility program. Through this program European Community researchers are subsidized to work together at a common site on common data resources to address issues of social problems using household microdata. The IRISS programs explicitly limit its support to EC residents but leaves open the possibility for other nations' scholars to participate if they can find the funds to support their research time at CEPS.   The IRISS will produce a stronger research infrastructure in the social and behavioral science as well as useful research products\r\n\r\n",
