 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate whether the hydrothermal discharge from the drowned and breached volcanic crater at Deception Island, Antarctica, is a sufficient source of dissolved iron to support the regional primary productivity in the ocean.   It is known that insufficient available iron as well as other elements can limit biological production, and that over large parts of the Southern Ocean inorganic nutrients are under-utilized, with the implication that some trace element, most probably iron, is the limiting factor.  There are moreover shallow regions within the Bransfield Strait where the productivity is 50 to 60 times as great as in the open ocean, where iron is presumed to be abundantly available.\r\n\r\nThe study will trace the discharge volume, its iron concentration, and the flushing rate of the crater during a cruise of the ice-strengthened research vessel Laurence M. Gould in November 1999.  That cruise is devoted to the study of how pelagic and benthic communities respond to the seasonal variations in the sea ice cover and will provide the context for the iron study.\r\n***\r\n",
