The conference will address issues related to diversity and meeting individual students' needs, as well as equity and opportunity to learn.  It will also provide a forum for designing an action plan for strengthening communication among the various parties (i.e. teachers, school administrators, university professors, parents, and leaders in business and industry) involved in preparing urban students for higher education and the workforce.  The conference is co-sponsored by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM).  It will be preceded by several months of planning.  A book of readings and proceedings will be compiled as a way to disseminate the results of the conference. \r\n\r\nThe conference will host 600 participants in October, 1999.  In particular, urban centers will be the targeted participant audience.  Local and national teacher leaders, school administrators, mathematics educators, university mathematics faculty, business representatives, and parent leaders will be invited to participate in the conference. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
