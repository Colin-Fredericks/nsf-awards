The students work on projects in the area of dynamic distributed real-time systems including aspects of Quality of Service specification and management and benchmarking of such systems.  Although the students are recruited nationwide, the program focuses on students from minority and women's institutions and from institutions lacking research facilities in the southwest region of the country.  The student projects are related to a large, multi-year DARPA-funded research project.  However, in addition to their participation in these projects, the students will be involved in literature searching, technical writing and making technical presentations.",
