 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposer is particularly interested in representing and analyzing scattered data both on n-dimensional space and on certain compact manifolds such as the \r\nm-dimensional sphere by positive definite and related functions. There are now \r\nseveral results related to approximation by positive definite (and related) \r\nfunctions on compact manifolds for which there are no known analogues on  \r\nn-dimensional Euclidean space for scattered points. For example, \r\nquasi-interpolation approximation methods, Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund inequalities\r\nleading to quadrature formulas associated with scattered points, \r\nsome approximation rate estimates for multilevel approximation methods and many other results known to be true on spheres do not have good counterparts on \r\nn-dimensional Euclidean space. Establishing some corresponding results on \r\nthese  spaces  with the idea of better understanding the \r\napproximation potential of positive definite functions and their applications is of special interest to us. In addition, we wish to address some of the \r\ninadequacies of radial basis function (RBF) approximation applicable to all \r\nmanifolds; namely, the limitations of the \"native space\" theory for RBF's in \r\nterms of convergence of interpolants,  and questions concerning the ability of \r\nglobally supported RBF's to approximate locally. In addition, the proposer \r\nwishes to investigate certain questions about constrained approximation.\r\n\r\nA major goal of our proposed research is to develop better methods to both \r\nrepresent and analyze data obtained from scattered sites located either in  \r\nspace or from sphere-like objects. For example, imagine temperature readings \r\nobtained at scattered sites over a particular region of the earth. One aim is to obtain temperature readings (or smog density readings, ozone readings etc.) \r\nover the the entire region by creating an appropriate model(function). Such a \r\nmodel makes \"predictive\" readings at unsampled sites possible. Also taking an \r\nincreasing number of samples over a given region should yield a \"better\" model \r\nto the underlying phenomena. We propose the study of such questions from a \r\nmathematical point of view. We note that better understanding of the \r\nrepresentation and analysis of data would have potential benefits to \r\nmeteorology, oceanography and satellite-based systems such as the Global \r\nPositioning System (GPS).\r\n\r\n",
