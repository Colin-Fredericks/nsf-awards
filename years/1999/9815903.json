The research funded by this award will increase our understanding of plant signal transduction through analysis of a mechanism that has been under study in both the U.S. and German labs.  Present knowledge of the mechanisms involved is unable to resolve certain complexities of the chain of chemical reactions involved in the plant process being looked at.  The collaboration makes use of specific expertise to be found only in the two labs, and will involve the exchange of graduate students as well as senior researchers.\r\n",
