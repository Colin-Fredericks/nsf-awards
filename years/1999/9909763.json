 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on using a novel scanning probe microscope to study the effects of membrane preparation and pretreatment on the surface ionic and catalytic activities of proton conducting membranes.  The technique being developed by the PI consists of an atomic force microscope in which the circuit is modified to include voltage-sensing capability.  This dual-mode scanning-probe microscopy technique will be used to probe the topography of ionic clusters on the outer surface and within wells of the outer surface of membranes exposed to both liquid water and water vapor.  Previous attempts to scan membrane surfaces have been made using scanning electrochemical microscopy.  This technique relies on measuring a current generated from an electrochemical reaction on the surface; consequently, the resolution has been low.  In the proposed method, the PI will attempt to measure the potential resulting from a platinum nanoprobe contacting an ionic cluster.  Higher sensitivity and higher two- and three-dimensional resolution is anticipated.  If the topography of the ionic clusters can be measured, the effects of membrane pretreatment and manufacturing process on cluster formation could be quantified.  Fundamental understanding of the behavior of ionic clusters could lead to improvements in fuel-cell membrane assemblies.",
