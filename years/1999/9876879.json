 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information infrastructures have historically benefited some individuals and organizations more than others. With the emergence of new information and communication technologies (ICTs), the convergence of older forms, and the federally encouraged expansion of information infrastructures, many worry that the distribution of benefits will become more uneven as some organizations shape these technologies to serve their specific needs. We do not fully understand why some organizations find ICTs useful--even essential--while others do not. Researchers have tried to explain this divergence in terms of the technical potential of ICTs and task-technology fit. However, new findings suggest that external environmental factors and interorganizational relationships strongly drive information investments and the use of ICTs.\r\n\r\nThis study will examine empirically how new ICTs come to be shaped and deployed the way they are. Specifically, it will focus on characterizing the ways in which technical and institutional influences interact to shape the intranet implementations of midwest firms in four different industries. A unique combination of qualitative methods has been designed to guide the research through three phases of data collection and analysis.  The study takes a novel approach that could foster a new way of thinking about ICTs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
