 "awd_abstract_narration": "Salamo\r\nThis award provides partial support for the development of an instrument to measure linear and nonlinear optical properties of small confined structures with a spatial resolution better than one nanometer.\r\n\r\nThe linear and nonlinear optical behavior of a single quantum dot is based on measuring the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility using an interferometric apertureless scanning microscope, SIAM. The basic concept is significantly different from the more conventional near-field scanning optical microscope NSOM. Rather than transmitting light through a small fiber aperture, SIAM makes use of light scattered from the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) or a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the surface to be probed.\r\n\r\nThis activity brings together three experimentalists and one theorist with complementary skills in quantum and nonlinear optics and in molecular beam epitaxy and scanning tunneling microscopy.  These scientists presently work with six graduate students, three undergraduates, and three post doctorals on projects that would be measurably enhanced by the instrument proposed here.   This activity involves four faculty and twelve individuals in research and research training.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\nThe development of this instrument is expected to significantly impact the research and educational experience of students and advance capability to explore the behavior of nanostructures.\r\n",
