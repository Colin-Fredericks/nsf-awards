 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes a series of experimental and qualitative studies that will help in understanding the role of carefully designed early field experiences for preservice teachers, coupled with mathematics content courses, on the beliefs and the mathematical growth of prospective elementary teachers of mathematics.  The PIs propose to develop instruments that provide accurate measures of:\r\n1. Beliefs of prospective teachers;\r\n2. Prospective teachers; depth of understanding of the school mathematics they expect to teach;\r\n3. Knowledge about what novices and experts actually attend to when observing teaching situations, with the understanding that this knowledge will guide the development of a field-based course.\r\n\r\nThe course will be evaluated using a quasi-experimental design employing assignment of classes of prospective teachers to one of three conditions.  Students in all three conditions will be compared as they complete their mathematics courses in subsequent semesters.  Related quasi-experimental studies are proposed to examine questions of timing.  Various other data will be collected as adjuncts to the two major studies.\r\n\r\nResearch results will offer other universities a knowledge base in planning effective teacher preparation programs. \r\n",
