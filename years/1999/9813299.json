In this research, the concept of using additional kinematic\r\ndescriptors other than the usual concept of strain will be explored.  The\r\noverall objective of the work is to develop micro-granular mechanical\r\ntheories using new kinematic descriptors so that the theories are\r\napplicable to the entire range of stress-deformation behavior.\r\n\r\nThe approach employed will be based on a micro-macro approach in which the\r\nbehavior of an assembly is linked to the properties of particles.\r\nExperimental data and computer simulation will form an integral part in the\r\ndevelopment of the theory.  The developed micro-granular mechanical theory\r\nwill be implemented to a finite element environment.  The model will be\r\nvalidated by comparing measured and predicted behavior of granular\r\nmaterials under different loading conditions.\r\n\r\nThe result of this research will provide insight into the theoretical\r\nframework of material localization and bifurcation in continuum mechanics.\r\nThe intrinsic length of material, which plays a major role in localized\r\nfailure zones, will be directly related to the micro-structure.  This\r\nunique feature significantly distinguishes this theory from\r\nphenomenologically based models.  The derived theories are expected to be\r\nextremely valuable not only to the field of micro-granular mechanics but\r\nalso to the field of finite element methods in the analysis of shear\r\nproblems.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
