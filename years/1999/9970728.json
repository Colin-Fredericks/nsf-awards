 "awd_abstract_narration": "A processor-and-memory hierarchy is an extension of the familiar notion of memory hierarchy that consists of including processors into one or more levels of the memory hierarchy. Assuming that the top (i.e. first) level of the hierarchy is the fastest, any given memory level is extended with processors that are slower, less expensive and in larger number than those in the preceding level.\r\n\r\nPrevious work led to evidence that processor-and-memory hierarchies are well suited for many applications and have better cost-performance than conventional designs.  Early research concentrated on message-passing designs and scientific applications. This project investigates shared-memory solutions and extends the applications under consideration to include commercial applications in general and data mining software in particular. Also underway is work towards the incorporation of data input/output capabilities into processor-and-memory hierarchies.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable evidence that forthcoming hardware technologies and application performance demands will lead to computer chips that combine large amounts of memory and multiple processors.  This research shows how to combine these systems to build larger, highly powerful and yet cost-efficient multiprocessors.  Conversely, it also identifies features that are desirable for chips useful for implementing processor-and-memory hierarchies. The overall contribution of the project consists of techniques and designs for computing machines that are faster and cheaper than those currently available.\r\n\r\n",
