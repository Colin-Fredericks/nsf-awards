 "awd_abstract_narration": "James Madison University (JMU) and North Carolina Central University (NCCU) are building a collaborative program in computational science with five broad goals: (1) to attract students into a technologically important field, (2) to improve the retention of those students who are recruited, (3) to provide students with useful skills and the outlook necessary to continue their own education, (4) to provide industry with graduates trained in a critically needed specialty, and (5) to provide the scientific community with people who can work productively on a large class of difficult scientific problems.\r\n\r\nThis project involves three elements: (1) the establishment of a parallel-computing capability, (2) course and curricular development in computational science including scientific visualization, and (3) the creation of a fluid-dynamics laboratory component for the computational science coursework.\r\n\r\nIn the computational science program, we are focusing initially on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for several reasons. Fluid dynamics provides a rich source of problems that can be used to demonstrate diverse approaches to developing mathematical models. By limiting our scope to problems in fluid physics, we can require mathematics majors to take enough physics courses to have a firm scientific background in that field without requiring them to take what would essentially be a second major In addition to being a rich source of physical and computational examples, fluid mechanics provides problems that draw on everyday experience and that students can recognize as useful and interesting. Well-conceived CFD projects will increase the student's physical intuition.\r\n\r\nThis project is adapting materials and practices from advanced work to the undergraduate curriculum.   Although the initial impact is on James Madison University and North Carolina Central University, the materials and practices developed under this project are likely to have a much wider impact.\r\n",
