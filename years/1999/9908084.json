The workshop, intended to serve as a forum for open discussion and lively debate, will be devoted to discrete algorithms and methods in the context of mobile and wireless computing and communications, an area that is already having and will have enormous impact in our lifestyle over the next several decades.\r\n\r\nThe workshop, also called DIAL M, encouraging research papers based on work-in-progress, brings together distinguished members of the computer science and engineering community.  Since the mobility aspect of the hosts and routers introduces a whole gamut of new research issues, the planned panel discussions and hot topic sessions should highly benefit graduate students.\r\n\r\n",
