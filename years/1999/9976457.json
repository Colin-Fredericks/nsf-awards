This includes research on nonequilibrium solid-state theory and on density-functional theory (DFT) of solid structures.  The Principal Investigator's groundbreaking work on this second topic was recognized in 1998 by sharing the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.  The first area will focus on thermodynamics of quantum systems as well as a non-heuristic study of the Landauer approach to electron transport models in nanostructures.  The second area will focus on ways to treat realistically the differing electron environment in bulk-like versus edge atoms in DFT as well as development of methods for including long-range polarization effects in DFT to treat asymptotic van der Waals effects.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports works by one of the founders of modern many-body materials theory, and a recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The grant contains research on extending current solid-state theory to treat nonequilbrium properties of materials such as electron transport in nanostructures.  The grant also supports work in  improving computational treatments of current bottlenecks in density-functional theory of electronic structure such as the differing electron environments near atoms surrounded by many other atoms versus atoms at the surface, and the long-standing difficulty in DFT in calculating long-range polarization-based forces in materials resulting from van der Waals interactions.\r\n***\r\n",
