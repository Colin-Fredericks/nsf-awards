The research to be carried out using these instruments include investigations of structure-viscoelastic property relationships of melt-transesterified engineering resins, and value-added composites, morphology of polyelectrolyte membranes, imaging of patterned organosiloxane films, and structure in metal and dielectric films.  The equipment will complement existing instrumentation for quantification of bulk polymer thermal properties and molecular weights in the Department of Chemistry, surface analytical instrumentation in the Department of Physics/Astronomy and in Chemistry, and imaging instrumentation for morphology in the Department of Biology and also in Physics.  Because of the overlap in interdisciplinary investigations, the beneficial impact of the equipment will extend beyond the graduate and advanced undergraduate students and faculty within each department.  \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of an atomic force microscope and a rheometer will be important additions to the materials analysis instrumentation collection and will provide increased opportunities for research carried out at Middle Tennessee State University, as well as for student training and introduction to skills relevant to jobs in the polymer industry.  Though collaborations, training seminars, and community outreach, the equipment will be used as a vehicle for increased interaction with regional industry. \r\n",
