 "awd_abstract_narration": "9900562\r\nCasjens\r\nDuring assembly of progeny particles, many viruses (typified by phage P22) assemble protein shells first and then insert DNA into these shells. The P22 shells contain three critical polypeptides, coat protein, scaffolding protein and portal protein.  In addition, two non-structural P22-encoded proteins, p2 and p3, are critical in the DNA recognition/entry process. The coat protein forms the exterior shell of the precursor particle, the scaffolding protein is required to build the procapsid but leaves the structure before DNA enters, and the portal protein forms a ring-shaped structure at one vertex of the protein shell.  After co-assembly with coat protein to form procapsids, scaffolding protein is released from the procapsid during the DNA packaging portion of the virion assembly pathway, and so it functions catalytically in virion assembly. The role of the P22 scaffolding protein is the central focus of this research.  P22 guides the coat protein's assembly by co-assembling with it, and it recruits the portal protein into the structure. These processes will be studied genetically and biophysically.  Knowledge gained will contribute to our understanding of the dsDNA viruses, and will also increase our knowledge of proteins that catalyze the assembly of other macromolecules. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the molecular basis of how viruses are built is important both at the level of expanding our knowledge of how Earth's biosphere works and in specific terms for agriculturally important viruses. Bacteriophage P22 is an experimentally tractable virus with features that are typical of many viruses with large dsDNA chromosomes.  P22 virus infection will be studied with the goal of understanding at a molecular level how large virus shells are assembled.  Knowledge gained will contribute to our overall understanding of the viruses, and will also specifically increase our knowledge of proteins that catalyze the assembly of other macromolecules. \r\n",
