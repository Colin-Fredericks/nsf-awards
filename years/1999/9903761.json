Relyea\r\n\r\nDivision of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211\r\n\r\nPROJECT ABSTRACT\r\n\tThis project focuses on an apparent tradeoff between competitive ability and predation resistance in animal populations.  The research seeks to understand how this tradeoff may have shaped the variability in behavior and morphology seen among natural populations and the ecological consequences of such changes on the community. The first objective is to examine how larval anurans respond to varying predator and competitor densities using experimental ponds.  The second goal is to determine whether predator-induced phenotypes are better at resisting predation but have low competitive ability while competitor-induced phenotypes are have high competitive ability but are poor at resisting predation.  The third goal is to quantify the genetic variation that underlies the production of predator- and competitor-phenotypes. The final goal is to examine the ecological consequences of predator- and competitor-induced variation by determining whether changes in behavior and morphology in one species can affect the performance of other species.\r\n\tThe results of this research will illustrate how predators and competitors not only alter the phenotypes and performance of other individuals in a population, but also how they impact community structure. Explaining the regulation of community structure is a primary goal in ecology and is critical to understanding species diversity. This research is important because it can reveal the underlying processes leading to the level and distribution of species diversity, and hence direct conservation efforts towards underlying natural processes that can maintain rich ecosystems for future generations.\r\n",
