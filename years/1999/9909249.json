Applications include power and energy systems, transportation systems, consumer appliances and electronics, robotics, automated industrial processes, chemical and process control, defense and aerospace systems, marine systems and many others.  System and control methodologies are becoming increasingly important in macroeconomic and macroeconomic studies, financial systems, system dynamics for emerging and mature industries and socioeconomic systems.\r\n\r\nIn parallel with the exploding applications, during the past decade the PI's have seen a great degree of progress in the development of novel theories, methodologies, and computer-aided design software for systems analysis and control system design. Such theoretical advances provide engineers and scientists with solid methodology foundations for the study of systems that are increasingly complex.  In succinct terms, systems and control theory deal with optimal decision making strategies under dynamic uncertainties.  Much remains to be done to develop relevant now theories and methodologies, since there is a \"theory gap\" for the class of applications that involve complex large-scale systems, decentralized/distributed decision making with increased dynamic uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the proposed workshop is to convene, by invitation only, a small select group of distinguished international and Portuguese experts to assess the state-of-the-art in systems and control theory and help define new and relevant directions for research for the next decade.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
