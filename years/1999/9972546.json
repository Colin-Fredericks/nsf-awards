The\r\napproach is to view algebras themselves as special cases of simplicial\r\nalgebras.  In this larger category, there exists a homotopy theory and\r\nnotions of homotopy groups and homology groups, depending on the type of\r\nalgebras considered, which are homotopy invariants.  Restricting to\r\n(simplicial) commutative algebras, the resulting homology theory is called\r\nAndre-Quillen homology, which has proved useful for both commutative\r\nalgebra and topology.  In particular, understanding when this homology\r\ntheory vanishes has implications in both commutative algebra and topology.\r\nOn the commutative algebra side, conjectures of Quillen indicate that the\r\nvanishing in high degrees of the Andre-Quillen homology of Noetherian\r\nalgebras, over a Noetherian ring, implies the homology must vanish above\r\ndegree two.  It is the intent of this project to resolve this conjecture\r\nand its implications for commutative algebra.  On the topological side,\r\nobstructions to the existence of a topological space with given mod p\r\ncohomology, as an unstable algebra over the Steenrod algebra, lie in\r\ncertain Andre-Quillen cohomology groups of that unstable algebra.  This\r\nproject will also investigate finding conditions for those obstructions to\r\nvanish as well as relating other aspects of the Andre-Quillen cohomology\r\nto the homotopy of that space, if it exists.\r\n     Central to studying topological spaces is the theory of their homotopy\r\ntype, which can be understood using the methods provided by algebraic\r\ntopology.  These methods involve assigning to spaces algebraic invariants,\r\ncalled homotopy, homology, and cohomology groups, whose internal structures\r\nhelp discern the internal structures of the original topological object.  A\r\ndual perspective can be developed whereby the methods of homotopy theory\r\ncan be used to study algebras on their own grounds.  In particular, there\r\nis a (co)homology theory, called Andre-Quillen (co)homology, for commutative\r\nalgebras that has proved useful to both commutative algebra and topology.\r\nThe goal of the present project is to understand under what conditions this\r\nhomology theory vanishes, either locally or globally, and the implications\r\nfor commutative algebra and topology.  For example, one focus will be on the\r\nimplications for commutative algebra of the global vanishing of Andre-Quillen\r\nhomology in high degrees.  Under certain special conditions, it is known that\r\nsuch a vanishing implies that the imputed commutative algebra has the very\r\nspecial feature of being a type of algebra called a local complete\r\nintersection.  Part of the present project is concerned with determining the\r\nimplications of such global vanishing under a weakening of these special\r\nconditions.  On the topological side, the cohomology of a space can be viewed\r\nas a commutative algebra.  One question that arises is: when can a given\r\ncommutative algebra be realized as the cohomology of a space?  An answer can\r\nbe given in terms of certain elements in the Andre-Quillen cohomology of the\r\ngiven commutative algebra: the space is realizable if and only if these\r\nelements vanish.  Another goal of the present project will be to understand\r\nthese obstruction elements and the conditions under which they vanish as well\r\nas relating other aspects of the Andre-Quillen cohomology to the homotopy of\r\nthat space, if it exists.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
