 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project will test a new method for extrapolating physical activity levels, or loading, from the skeletal remains of extinct human populations. The novel method that the investigators will test is based on quantifying preserved microscopic evidence of bone remodeling in the femoral cortex.  As loading is not the only factor to affect remodeling, systemic factors will be quantified and standardized by using measurements on the rib, a non-weight bearing element.  \r\n\r\nThe analyses will utilize archaeological samples from a site on the Peruvian coast.  The skeletal remains here can be assigned to one of three time periods; the first two being from hunter-gatherer horizons, the third a more sedentary maritime -based economy.  Previous studies have demonstrated that the latter group evidenced less bone loading, thus providing a known control.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research have the potential to provide unique information on behavioral differences among past populations. This histological method provides a practical tool for deducing activity levels from fragmentary archaeological material.  This is particularly important for in many cases remains are too fragmentary to allow current investigative techniques.  \r\n\r\nUnderstanding physical activity level differences between prehistoric populations (which exhibit low incidence of osteoporotic fracture) and modern industrialized populations (among which bone loss and skeletal fragility represent major public health concerns) would contribute significantly to our current understanding of the biological and cultural factors underlying of age-associated bone loss. \r\n\r\n",
