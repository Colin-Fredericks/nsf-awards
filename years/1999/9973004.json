 "awd_abstract_narration": "National science standards agree that science literacy involves coming to understand central themes in science-ideas like growth and diversity, behavior, structure and form.  However, little is known about how student understanding of these \"big ideas\" evolves over the sweep of a student's education. Most research focuses on student learning of particular topics of science (e.g., \"weather\" or \"evolution\") and lasts for relative brief periods of time. As a consequence, educators receive little guidance about how to orchestrate instruction toward the long-term development of core thematic ideas.  \r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers, administrators, and classroom teachers in a school district will work together to develop and study a modeling approach to school science.  Model-based reasoning is the cornerstone of scientific practice and the most promising route to the themes outlined in the standards.  Researchers and district teachers will work to put these forms of instruction in place and, over a three-year period, to study transitions in student thinking. Participants include nine teachers and their students:  six at elementary school and three in the sixth grade (first year of middle school).  Administrators agree that students will \"graduate\" across grades within the participating classrooms during the project, affording the opportunity to conduct longitudinal study to learn how students' understanding of these \"big ideas\" emerges and takes hold. \r\n\r\nAn existing long-term professional development collaboration provides the site for this research.  In this collaboration, teachers within the district have made substantial progress toward adopting standards-based mathematics and using it as a resource for reasoning about science. This surrounding teacher community provides collegial and material support for this work, and also serves as a context for its wider spread. The research includes:  yearly administration of science achievement benchmark items (with comparison to both local and national samples), an experimental study of the development of students' representational repertoires, analysis of videotapes of classroom interactions during targeted instructional units with follow-up interviews, analysis of student reasoning and justification of their models during classroom \"critique\" sessions, and analysis of student performance on transfer \"model-eliciting tasks.\"  A second component of the research focuses on the changing content and pedagogical knowledge of the participating teachers.  Interviews, discussions of student work, and videotapes of practice will be used to track these changes. \r\n\r\nThe standards paint a picture of the kind of science literacy that can emerge over years of well-planned education supported by thoughtful curricula and excellent pedagogy.  To create these conditions for all children, research is needed to illuminate the outcomes that can reasonably be expected (both products and processes of learning by students and teachers) and to enhance understanding of what it takes to achieve them-not over a few weeks or months, but over years-the time span required to grasp profound idea. \r\n\r\n",
