 "awd_abstract_narration": "McEdward\r\n\r\n\t\tAdvances in our understanding of the ecology of reproduction and development in marine organisms require combining life history theory with functional analyses of larvae as pelagic organisms.   This combination should prove to be an important integrative link between these fields .  A central question will be what ecological factors influence the development of feeding larvae?  A concentration on energetics is important because this is central to many general theoretical models of life history ecology and evolution.  This project will provide new information on the development of planktotrophic larvae by evaluating the consequences of facultative feeding in a closely related, co-occurring group of echinoids that differ widely in egg size.\r\n\t\tTraditionally marine invertebrate larvae have been classified into two mutually exclusive, qualitatively different nutritional types: feeding and non-feeding. Most larvae that require food for development are thought to come from very small eggs and require food throughout larval life. Non-feeding larvae develop from very large yolky eggs and cannot obtain or utilize exogenous food until after metamorphosis. Many life history traits are correlated with nutritional mode, such as egg size, fecundity, larval morphology, development time, and juvenile size. Empirical observations of the distribution of life history traits and theoretical modeling of larval strategies have led to the view that the extremes of the two nutritional patterns represent the most successful reproductive strategies.\r\n\t\tRecent work on the feeding requirements of echinoid larvae challenges the predictions made by the classic models of reproductive strategies in marine invertebrates. A surprising range of \"intermediate\" strategies that had not been recognized before, nor predicted, has been documented. Among echinoids (sea urchins and sand dollars) there exists a continuum of feeding strategies across which larvae vary substantially in the degree to which they require food for development to metamorphosis. The amount of nutritional reserves provided in the egg by the parent is positively correlated with the stage at which the larvae require exogenous food. It is predicted that egg energy content also determines the capacity for facultative feeding, i.e., the ability to acquire exogenous food before endogenous reserves are exhausted and feeding becomes obligatory. The lack of information on facultative larval feeding precludes a meaningful assessment of the ecological and evolutionary implications of differences in larval strategies.\r\n\t\tThe project seeks to assess the contribution of facultative feeding in planktotrophic echinoid larvae. Two approaches will be used. First, laboratory experiments will be used to evaluate empirically the contribution of facultative feeding to larval development rate and juvenile energy content in six related, co-occurring species that have different egg sizes and different abilities to develop in the absence of food. Second, new theoretical models of larval development and growth will be constructed to analyze the consequences of facultative feeding on the relative advantages of different levels of parental investment. These studies are designed to generate new information on the relationships that underlie the diversity of larval strategies among marine invertebrates.\r\n\r\n",
