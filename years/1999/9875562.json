 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three recent advances in technology -- the advent of the Web, the revolution of digital media, and the dramatic performance improvement of PCs -- have opened the door for a host of new 3D computer graphics applications.  Access to this technology, as well as broadening interest in graphics among non-technical people, drives a growing demand for new ways to catalogue, view, modify, and protect 3D models.  Several challenges to providing these tools lie in the growing size and heterogeneity of both the data available and the groups of people manipulating these data.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates four application areas pertinent to 3D\r\nsurfaces: (1) a content-based query method for 3D surfaces in order to find 3D models in a large database -- this technique will enable people to find 3D models on the Web and will enhance catalogue searching for the digital library of the future; (2) algorithms for surface interpolation in order to visualize either the time-evolution of an isosurface or an animation of the isosurface from low to high threshold values -- this technology will aid understanding of 3D data sets such as those resulting from medical scans or astrophysical simulations; (3) controls for reshaping a 3D model based on hand-drawn gestures and interactions with other models -- these controls permit 3D animators to reshape models in a natural way, and they allow 2D\r\nanimators to apply complex textures to hand-drawn figures; and (4) a method for insertion and detection of an invisible digital watermark in a 3D surface -- watermarking technology addresses concerns about copyright protection of proprietary models, and will thereby spur the proliferation of new models on the Web.\r\n\r\nA factor that binds these projects together is that they rely on two common underlying technologies.  The projects share a common\r\nfundamental technology -- multiresolution analysis -- a tool for\r\nrepresenting and manipulating data at different levels of detail.  At a higher level, they share a common problem -- the surface correspondence problem -- which looks at how to map one surface onto another optimally.  Solutions to this problem have direct application in the four projects highlighted above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
