 "awd_abstract_narration": "Henley\r\n\r\nExtreme environments are often defined as those chronically exhibiting an arbitrarily high or low level of a particular physical or chemical factor. Extremophilic organisms tolerant of such conditions have yielded valuable insight into the functioning of organisms inhabiting more typical conditions, including crop plants.  Few studies have addressed multiple variable stress factors likely to be even more adverse to life.  Evaporitic salt flats, such as at the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma, represent such a dynamically stressful habitat: direct sunlight, up to 20-25 degree C daily (60-70 degree C annual) surface temperature range, episodically varying interstitial salinities from near 0 to over 300 g/L, and potentially wide daily fluctuation in pH, redox potential, and dissolved gases and nutrients.  Thus, the mostly undescribed photosynthetic and heterotrophic microbes in this habitat may provide unique insights into the evolution of life beyond the limits of tolerance for virtually all species on Earth.  The hypothesis upon which this project is based is that interacting stress factors determine survival, productivity and competitive outcomes in hypersaline photoautotrophs, and that halophiles are tolerant of wide fluctuations in physicochemical conditions in addition to steady-state extreme conditions.  Objectives of this project are: (1) isolation and physiological characterization of salt flat cyanobacteria and algae; (2) temporal and spatial characterization of chlorophyll biomass in relation to the dynamic salt flat physical/chemical conditions (aided by a nearby Oklahoma Mesonet climatological station); (3) in situ manipulations of physical and chemical conditions to identify limiting and stress factors; and (4) laboratory culture experiments to test specific a priori hypotheses and others inspired by objectives 1-3. Comparisons will be made of the physiological responses to temperature, nutrients, visible and ultraviolet irradiance, and constant versus variable salinity.  Laboratory analytical techniques, will include (1) fluorescence versus temperature curves to rapidly screen for minimum lethal high temperature; (2) spectroscopic and/or antibody probing for the presence of flavodoxin, a protein specifically induced under iron stress; (3) photosynthesis and respiration rate measurements (O2 exchange); and (4) chlorophyll fluorescence analysis to diagnose acute and chronic stress effects on the photosynthetic apparatus.  The results of this study will be of interest to evolutionary biologists and plant and microbial physiologists.\r\n",
