 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will combine logic and probability theory to develop new\r\nmethods and decision aids for causal reasoning.  We will use a new\r\naxiomatization of the classical idea of a probability tree, which goes well\r\nbeyond the current paradigm of Bayes nets in allowing modular\r\nrepresentation of probabilistic information.  Financial statement auditing\r\nwill be used as a test bed for the methods, which will ultimately be\r\napplicable to many domains where expert systems are used.\r\n\r\nThe goal of an audit is the expression of an opinion on whether a set of\r\nfinancial statements presents a business's financial position and\r\noperations fairly in all material respects, in accordance with generally\r\naccepted accounting principles. In reaching this opinion, the auditor may\r\nneed to consider a variety of subsidiary questions:  whether items such as\r\nthe value of inventory are materially correct; whether internal control is\r\noperating effectively; whether the business can continue as a going\r\nconcern, etc.  The evidence bearing on these questions evidence is usually\r\npersuasive but not conclusive, and its assessment must be based on a causal\r\nmodel of the business, its environment, and the audit.\r\n\r\nPrior research has focused on representing and aggregating uncertainty\r\nwithin a model.  Although this research has met its own goals reasonably\r\nwell, the model itself is almost always either overly simplified or else\r\nvery specialized, and hence the research has not produced decision aids\r\nwith the flexibility to serve auditors going into new engagements.  Such\r\naids would have to help auditors build causal models, a task they find\r\nchallenging.  \r\n\r\nConstructing adequate models means refining models.  We always begin an\r\naudit with a simplified model, but the audit constantly raises new issues\r\nthat must be incorporated into this model.  The modularity allowed by our\r\napproach permits this constant refinement.  We will develop an inference\r\nengine that permits such refinement, together with detailed casual models\r\nfor an illustrative group of audit problems and prototype decision aids\r\nthat may provide a test-bed for future empirical research on audit judgment.\r\n\r\nProbabilistic models currently available to auditors are neither simple\r\nenough to be used effectively nor complex enough to fit practical auditing\r\nrealities.  This project will overcome these limitations by developing a\r\nclear, rigorous and usable concept of refinement.  When new evidence\r\nreveals that factors previously deemed unimportant are, in fact, relevant,\r\nthey can be taken into account by refining the existing model, rather than\r\nreplacing it.  This ability to reason simultaneously and consistently with\r\ncausal analyses at different levels of detail will allow the auditor to\r\navoid models that are hopelessly naive or impossible complex",
