More specifically, the funds requested ($6,000) are for partial support of the travel expenses of graduate students wanting to attend the meeting. The money would be for fourteen travel grants ($400 each). An additional $400 will be used as a price for the best paper presentation by one graduate student. The $400 grant would help the students to cover the registration fees ($65 for members of the Electrochemical society and $75 for non-members) but also defray costs of other expenses (airplane ticket, hotel, meals, and short course registration).\r\n\r\nThis symposium will address recent developments in the area of nanoscale semiconductor, metal-lic, and organic structures. Emphasis will be placed on quantum effects and single electron storage in small scale Silicon and III-V compound Structures and devices. It will also cover fundamental issues in luminescence physics and chemistry of new classes of phosphor and porous materials in-cluding both atomic and molecular structures. Papers are solicited that cover fundamental aspects of science and engineering of quantum confinement in nanostructures, as well as related technology and applications.\r\n\r\nAreas of particular interest include: (1) Clusters and Other Nanostructures, (2) Chemistry of Nanostructures, (3) Novel Fabrication Techniques for Nanostructures, (4) Electron Transport in Nanostructures, (5) Cooperative Phenomena in Nanoclusters, (6) New Device Concepts, (7) Layered Magnetic Structures and Giant Magnetoresistance, (8) Quantum Architectures and Circuits, (9) Optical Properties (wells, wires, and dots), (10) Organic, phosphor, and porous materials, (11) Spectroscopy of luminescent materials (photo-,cathodo-,electro-, radio-luminescence, and coherent luminescence), (12) Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors.\r\n\r\nA short course on \"Simulation of Nanoscale Materials and Devices\" will be offered at the ECS meeting as part of the symposium.\r\n***\r\n",
