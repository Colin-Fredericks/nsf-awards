Alaska's goal is to strengthen research facilities and expertise in targeted disciplines, enhance training and education for students in science and engineering, and increase efforts to promote transfer of technology from the state's universities to Alaska's private and public sectors.  The planning process will address five areas, including: 1) assessment of Alaska's existing research infrastructure; 2) identification of Alaska's emerging areas of research excellence; 3) identification of the barriers to improving Alaska's research infrastructure; 4) establishment of state priorities for science and engineering research; and 5) establishment of a ten year plan to address Alaska's science and engineering needs.   The planning phase is expected to culminate in preparation of a research infrastructure implemenation proposal to the National Science Foundation. \r\n",
