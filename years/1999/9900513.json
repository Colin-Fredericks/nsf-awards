This research has led to biotechnological applications of RNA as both tool and target. New and exciting RNA structures have been discovered and are revealing  new modes of interactions with proteins, other RNA's, DNA, and small molecules capable of disrupting RNA function. The Symposium on RNA Biology III, \"RNA: Tool and Target\", will replicate the format and focus of the highly successful symposium on the same topic held in 1997. The focus will be the biochemical and molecular interactions of RNA and RNA-protein complexes and their potential applications in areas important to society. This meeting will create an intimate environment for intellectual exchange and a forum for sharing data, techniques, and  biotechnological applications.\r\n\r\nThe symposium has the following objectives: (1) Promoting communication in the important research area of RNA interactions; (2) Providing an educational experience for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in a setting conducive to open discussions with established investigators who have broad experience in the RNA field; (3) Stimulating discussion and the sharing of ideas and techniques by established investigators  as well as by postdoctoral fellows and students; and (4) Bringing researchers to a venue where three major universities, federal research institutions and laboratories, and many corporate research centers are located. The principal site for the meeting will be the North Carolina Biotechnology Center in Research Triangle Park, NC, a  state supported center recognized for knowledge-based biotechnology development.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide  stipend and travel funds for five more junior investigators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
