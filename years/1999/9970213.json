 "awd_abstract_narration": "SALTMAN 9970213\r\n\r\nProfessor Saltman proposes to study questions concerning \r\ndivision algebras and invariant fields. In the area of division \r\nalgebras, he will study questions that all involve ways of describing \r\nthese objects. One series of questions concern special, so called \r\nsemidirect product, division algebras with \r\narbitrary ground field. He is asking whether they are \r\neven more special cyclic algebras. Another series of questions \r\nin involve considering general division algebras with special \r\nground fields, in this case function fields of curves over p-adics, \r\nand asking whether they are cyclic. The second area of study of \r\nProfessor Saltman, invariant fields, will also have two strands. \r\nThe first series of questions concern trying to use Galois cohomology \r\nto show certain of these fields are nonrational. The second \r\nseries of questions involve simply studying these invariant fields \r\nand, for example, investigating division algebras with these \r\ninvariant fields as center.\r\n \r\nDivision algebras are simple objects that have been studied \r\nfor over a hundred years. The basic idea is to consider \r\nfinite dimensional vector spaces with a product that is well behaved. \r\nThat is, the product is associative and, as in the real numbers, \r\nevery nonzero element has an inverse, but the product is \r\nnoncommutative (i.e. a times b is not b times a). \r\nIt turns out the these objects embody deep properties \r\nof their centers which are the more familiar ``fields'' like the \r\nrationals or the reals. Describing all division algebras with \r\na fixed center is really saying something deep about the arithmetic \r\nof this center. There are ``generic'' or very general division \r\nalgebras whose properties in some ways reflect the properties \r\nof all division algebras. Their centers are, however, hard to understand \r\nso called invariant fields. One can directly study these invariant fields \r\nand thereby understand more about division algebras. \r\nOne can use, as tools in this study, a whole array of \r\nmathematics including algebraic geometry, Galois cohomology, \r\nand algebraic K-theory. \r\n",
