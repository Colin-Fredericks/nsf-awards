 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing materials to provide a \"gateway\" into microelectronics for first year university and community college students.  The project uses two sets of tools -- virtual experiments (that is, computer-based simulations) and a novel set of real-life laboratory modules.  Virtual experiments provide students with visual representations of objects and processes that they can manipulate.  Some virtual experiments describe the laboratory modules and others provide experience with manipulable (virtual) microelectronic devices.  Both virtual and real-life experimments emphasize the acquisition of knowledge by doing.  We hope to guide students toward an understanding of underlying principles without the need for complex mathematical or other prerequisites.\r\n\r\nMaterials will be combined in different ways to suit varied educational needs and interests.  Software \"Gateway Applets\" will provide a layered introduction to the field, allowing a students to \"tear apart\" a computer to reveal circuits, chips, and embedded microelectronic devices.  A stand-alone self-guided tour will be available via the Web for anyone curious about \"those mysterious chips.\"  On-campus, software and hardware experiments will be used in \"drop-in\" modules incorporated into several existing courses or used in new courses.\r\n\r\nThe materials are being developed by a team with extensive microelectronis and software experience and are being tested at community college and university campuses.",
