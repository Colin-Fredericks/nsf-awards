 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division supports the work of Professor Donald Berry of the Department of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, which focusses on two principal objectives: (i)  the elucidation of those factors that impinge on the relative efficacy of \"alpha\" and \"beta\" elimination processes in transition metal complexes of alkyl, silyl and germyl complexes, and (ii) the exploitation of these processes toward the synthesis of novel systems with unusual structures, bonding and reactivity. The systems targeted are the metal complexes of formal divalent species such as carbenes, silylenes and germylenes, which have been implicated in a variety of catalytic transformations of organic and organoelement compounds.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research aims at understanding alpha and beta elimination processes, so important in catalytic processes. It will have significant impact on catalytic transformations and in polymer chemistry, as well as in making major advances in scientific knowledge. The work will contribute considerably to the intellectual teaching and training of students and post-doctorate associates in an area of industrial significance.",
