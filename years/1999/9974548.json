 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Professor Michael Marsella at the University of California-Riverside is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division. The focus of the research is the design and synthesis of three-dimensional, thiophene-based conjugated organic polymers and the role that complex topologies  might play in their structure-property relationships. In the first project, highly crosslinked polymers will be formed by coupling tetrahedrally-joined unsaturated monomers with oligothiophene units. These polymers will be conducting , and with appropriate functionality, capable of molecular and topological recognition, suggesting applications as vaporesponsive sensors. Pore size and shape will be varied to optimize response.  In the second project, three-dimensional polymers based on coupling of cyclic tetra(2,3-thienylene) oligomers will be prepared. These polymers will serve as scaffolds for the construction of both racemic and enantiomerically pure conducting single and double stranded helices, capable of expanding or contracting as a function of their oxidation state and suggesting applications as actuators and pressure-sensitive electron donors/acceptors.\r\n\r\nBy integrating conductivity with molecular recognition elements and size and shape selectivity, polymers will be prepared which will serve as selective sensors and offer the possibility of forming arrays which may mimic the sense of smell, i.e an \"artificial nose\". Helical conducting polymers which change their bulk topology as a function of their oxidation state may provide a basis for the design of \"molecular muscles\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
