The Principle Investigators include:  A.Jay Kaufman, a recent addition to the Department of  Geology  faculty  after seven years as  a  post-doctoral fellow and research scientist in stable isotope geochemistry at  Harvard  University; Karen Prestegaard, a  physical  and chemical  hydrologist  in  the Department  of  Geology;  and Margaret  Palmer, an ecologist in the Department of Zoology. In  addition, Christina Gallup, a geochronologist and  coral researcher in the Department of Geology, and Russ Dickerson, an atmospheric chemist in the Department of Meteorology will use the new instrumentation in their studies.\r\n\r\nThe  establishment  of  a  gas source  stable  isotope  mass spectrometer  at the University of Maryland  represents  the first  academic facility of its kind in the Washington  D.C. area.    As   such,  this  facility  will  allow  additional collaborative studies by local researchers, in particular at George Washington   University   and   the    Smithsonian Institution.  The gas source instrument will be housed in  a newly-renovated  laboratory adjacent to the existing  stable isotope  preparation  laboratory in the Chemistry  building. This  facility,  funded  by  the university  and  the  Earth Sciences  Instrumentation and Facilities  Program  (EAR/IF), will  support research initiatives in chemical stratigraphy, carbonate  geochemistry, global climatic  and  environmental change, coral  research,   hydrology,   atmospheric and environmental sciences.\r\n***\r\n",
