This project takes a vertical approach spanning architectures, programming model, operating systems and algorithms. A stream-based programming model is developed for disklets and their interaction with their peers. A restricted execution environment is designed for the execution of disklets. A simulator that contains detailed models for disks, networks and the associated libraries and device drivers and relatively coarse-grain models of processors and I/O interconnects is developed. Active Disk algorithms are developed for a suite of data-intensive algorithms for relational databases, image processing and satellite data processing. The performance of these algorithms running on Active Disks is compared with that of efficient algorithms running on conventional architectures, such as clusters and SMPs.\r\n",
