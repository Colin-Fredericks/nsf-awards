 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is intended to give undergraduate students an opportunity to be involved in mathematics research.  It is especially intended to give this chance to students who may not have sufficient resources at their home institution.  For this reason, applications are encouraged from students at schools without graduate programs or any school where undergraduate research opportunities are not available.  To encourage participation by members of groups traditionally underrepresented in mathematics, applications are solicited from women, minorities and those with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe general area of research will be discrete mathematics ranging from finite groups, and Ramsey theory to optimization and combinatorial geometry.  Each of the listed disciplines has a large number of problems suitable for undergraduate research.  Students are anticipated to choose their favorite problems and work individually or in small groups on one or more of the problems.\r\n\r\nThe program will emphasize the development of research skills and the reading of scientific literature.  In addition, the students are expected to develop their communication skills, in particular, how to write up their anticipated results and how to communicate them orally to others.",
