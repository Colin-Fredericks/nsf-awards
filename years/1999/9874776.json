 "awd_abstract_narration": "9874776\r\nKeesing\r\nSavannas cover 50% of the area of Africa and harbor a spectacular diversity of organisms. These savannas are dominated by the presence of both high density and high diversity of large mammals, particularly ungulates and carnivores. Consequently, the focus of most research on savanna community ecology has been centered on these conspicuous mammals. This emphasis has obscured interest in how the effects of these dominant organisms reverberate through their communities. This CAREER research project will investigate how the effects of ungulate biodiversity cascade through a savanna community, affecting the diversity and abundance of small mammals, vegetation and arthropods through disturbance and herbivory. This project will address both the cause and the consequences of changes in biodiversity within savanna ecosystems, a topic of great theoretical and empirical importance. This project will take advantage of an existing field enclosure experiment at the Mpala Research Centre in central Kenya. Specific goals of the research are to investigate (1) whether small mammals can compensate for herbivory by large mammals when the latter are excluded, (2) whether large ungulates increase small mammal diversity through disturbance and its effects on plants and arthropods, and (3) whether the local density of small mammals influences recruitment of woody vegetation. Research will be conducted by the PI and a number of undergraduate students from Siena College.\r\n\tStudents participating in the project will also be involved in educational research, in cooperation with the Evaluation Consortium of the State University of New York in Albany. Educational research will determine the degree to which students' beliefs about the nature of scientific knowledge influence and are influenced by their participation in research. Thus, this project will integrate scientific research by the PI and student investigators on the causes and consequences of biodiversity in African savannas with educational research on how students learn about the process of science.\r\n",
