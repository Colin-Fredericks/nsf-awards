 "awd_abstract_narration": "Early childhood undernutrition is a significant problem in many developed and developing countries throughout the world. Nutritional status in children, as indicated by well-accepted anthropometric measures, is heavily influenced by dietary adequacy, diarrheal morbidity and parasite load within a complex milieu of sociocultural, environmental, and genetic factors. This study will examine the role of diet and dietary change on the nutritional status of children between 12 and 72 months of age living in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \r\n\r\nRecent survey data indicate that even in food-secure settings, including impoverished urban and rural settings in the U.S.,  undernutrition remains a source of excess morbidity and mortality in  young children. These findings raise questions as to whether individual children are receiving adequate nutriture so as to maintain energy balance or whether co-morbid conditions or other factors are compromising the effects of adequate intake. \r\n\r\nThere is recognition that diet in the Marshall Islands, as in other developing countries, has changed since Western contact. While observations about transitions to a \"high-fat, energy-dense diet\" have been made, few quantitative analyses of how the composition of children's diets vary in remote versus more modern settings have been undertaken to date. This research will reach beyond the relationship between protein/calorie nutriture and nutritional status to explore the relationships among dietary quality, adequacy and nutritional status. Data will be collected through a variety of mechanisms including 1) individual dietary and morbidity recall data; 2) infant feeding history; 3) the assessment of nutritional status; 4) household- and community-level demographic data 5) anthropometric data on other household members. The research will also explore the limits of dietary variation found in traditional and modern diets that support normal growth in children. \r\n",
