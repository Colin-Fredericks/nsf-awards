 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development award provides funding to develop methods to support sound and rational decision making in complex, large-scale systems design.  The research initiatives include:  (1) developing game theory methods to model large-scale design problems that are being performed by multiple designers or design teams,(2) using statistical and probabilistic techniques to develop methods to approximate the decision interfaces among designers or subsystems, and (3) integrating modern operations research and visualization techniques into decision support tools to describe and predict the effects of various decisions on product performance and configuration.  The educational aims are to develop engineering design awareness and associated programs in local K-12 schools,  integrate systems design technology and techniques into the undergraduate and graduate curriculums,  and  continue to develop systems design distance learning courses utilizing network and multimedia capabilities at the University at Buffalo.\r\n     If successful, the results of this research will lead to the capability to describe existing design process protocols, rapidly explore system decision tradeoffs, and predict the effects of different strategic decision structures.  The primary benefits of this research include allowing designers to quantify the interfaces in the design of large-scale systems.  These interfaces include the tradeoffs in integrating and coordinating multiple decision-makers or teams, functional interfaces between subsystems, and interfaces between temporal product realization stages, such as design and manufacturing.\r\n",
