Kits will consist of a booklet describing the biological/genetic concept (illustrated), Wisconsin Fast Plants of pre-determined genetic lines, photographs of DNA marker bands from electrophoresis gels, and a classroom poster showing a linkage map of 50 genetic markers on the 10 chromosomes of Brassica rapa.  In addition, advanced protocols and reagents for extracting DNA and amplifying it using PCR will be available as an option for those schools with the appropriate equipment.  Biology students in middle and high school (grades 6-12) biology classes will use these kits.  The kits will allow students to make a visual connection between the results of DNA analysis (separated bands of DNA on electrophoresis gels) and observations of plant morphology, a connection many students have difficulty making. The laboratory explorations promote inquiry-based learning in genetic research and effectively illustrate the utility of genetics in solving problems of scientific as well as social issues.  In addition, it utilizes plants in an area that has become over-represented with animal models.  Carolina Biological Supply Company, who already markets Wisconsin Fast Plant kits for classroom study, will donate 6 PCR thermal cyclers which can be used in a lending program, as well as other contributions to cover expenses for teacher training workshops. The University of Wisconsin Teacher Enhancement in Biology Program will assist the PI in the execution of the professional development workshops. \r\n\r\n",
