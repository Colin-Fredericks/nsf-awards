The new methods that we will  develop are built on an interdisciplinary mix of ideas from dynamical systems and ergodic theory, control theory and microscale physics.\r\nWe will study mixing of fluids   in geometries  of the scale of 1 micron.  The work proposed here  includes the study of active control of mixing as well as treatment of new physical effects such as rarefaction and electric double layer, introduced by the small scale of the devices.   We will provide a fundamental theory for control of mixing in this context using methods of robust control theory and ergodic theory. This study will provide theoretical backbone for the rapidly evolving field of control in microfluid systems.\r\nWe also propose to  study the dynamics and control of macroscopic and microscopic compression systems. We have recently developed  a mathematical model for axial compression system dynamics by averaging and scaling of the Navier-Stokes equations.  A rigorous study of the solutions will be pursued and the relevant applied mathematics methods developed.    Possibilities of active control of boundary layer instabilities using the so-called microflaps will be studied.  Microcompressors for the use in micro jet engines are currently being developed. Modelling and control issues in microcompressors will be studied.\r\nWe will familiarize  students  with the current developments on the interface between applied mathematics and  engineering. We propose to teach a Nonlinear Phenomena class that uses examples from the research described above as the background motivation and problem generator. The students in our research group will be exposed to a truly interdisciplinary set of topics from dynamical systems, control theory, mathematics, microscale physics and engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
