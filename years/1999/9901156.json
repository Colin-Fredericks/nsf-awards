The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Susan G. Singley with support for twelve months to work with Dr. Ian Pool at the Population Studies Centre of the University of Waikato, in Hamilton, New Zealand.  Their research is on \"Restructuring the \"Family Wage\": Economic and Family Change in New Zealand, 1976-1996.\"\r\nThis project will examine the joint impact of family and economic change on poverty, inequality, and gender roles in New Zealand, which has undergone dramatic economic and social policy restructuring during the 1980s and 1990s.  \"Family wage\" is the earnings, which are sufficient for a breadwinner to support a family.  Dr. Singley will do a quantitative analysis of changes in the family wage between 1976 and 1996, using census data.  Then she will do a qualitative inquiry into economic and social policy changes during this time period that will complement the quantitative analysis.\r\nThe Population Studies Centre houses a computer-based data set of the 1976-1996 censuses and they have research funds available to support additional census data extraction.  Current work at the Centre has focused on issues of family structural change, economic well-being, and the interface of demographic analysis and policy development.  This project will allow a mutual exchange of ideas on methodological issues and techniques relevant to social problems facing both countries.   \r\n***\r\n",
