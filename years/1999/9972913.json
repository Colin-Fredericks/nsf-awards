 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ermentrout\r\n9972913\r\n     The investigator continues work on the applications of\r\nnonlinear dynamics to cell biology and physiology with particular\r\nemphasis in neurophysiology.  Specifically, the following problems\r\nare studied: 1.  Analysis of synaptic bistability; what is the\r\ndynamic mechanism by which two (and more) mutually coupled\r\nneurons can maintain activity in absence of inputs?  2.  How does\r\nadaptation enhance the synchronization of excitatorily coupled\r\nneural oscillators?  3.  What determines the form and properties\r\nof ``lurching'' waves that arise in systems of neurons that are\r\ncoupled with delays as well as in models of thalamic\r\noscillations?  4.  What is the effect of inhibition and slow\r\nexcitatory synapses on the propagation of waves in cortical\r\nslices?  5.  How are free and bound actin spatially distributed\r\nin the cell; is there any nontrivial spatial dependence on the\r\nlength distribution of the polymerized molecule?\r\n     The investigator studies how mathematical methods can be\r\nused to understand how biological systems work.  Specifically, he\r\nis interested in how nerve cells interact with each other to\r\nproduce activity that is related to behavior.  For example, when a\r\nperson or animal holds something in short-term memory (like a\r\nphone number) how does the relevant group of neurons stay on and\r\nwhat turns it off?  Mathematical models are created and\r\nmathematical techniques are used to study these models in order\r\nto suggest new experiments.  During normal and abnormal behavior\r\nparts of the nervous system are capable of producing waves that\r\nmove across regions of the brain.  The investigator is interested\r\nin what factors determine the properties of these waves, such as\r\ntheir speed and shape.  Finally, he studies models of the\r\ncomponents inside the cell that are responsible for the cell's\r\nshape and how it moves around.\r\n\r\n",
