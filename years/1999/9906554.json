The workshop will convene leading researchers in the field of neural network research from the U.S. and the NIS.  Soviet science launched a large program of neural bionics in the early 1980s.  However, because of the dissolution of the USSR, scientists in the newly independent states have had few chances to meet with the international community.  The goal of this workshop is to bring together U.S. and NIS researchers to identify one or more research topics where joint efforts could be mutually beneficial.  The workshop will be organized by Dr. Donald C. Wunsch of Texas Tech University, and Professor Alexander Gorban', Associate Director of the Institute of Computational Modeling, Krasnoyarsk, Russia.\r\n\r\nThis research in electrical engineering fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and NIS to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
