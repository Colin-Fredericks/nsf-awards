 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Bacteriology and the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin-Madison will provide opportunities for summer research projects for undergraduate students in microbiology, molecular biology, and related fields. Extra effort will be made to recruit qualified students that are women, minority or disabled, or who otherwise have limited opportunities to conduct laboratory research at their home institution. The main goal of the program is to attract and stimulate motivated students to pursue careers in research, while providing them with hands-on experience. The Department of Bacteriology has an internationally recognized research faculty, committed to both undergraduate and graduate education, who will direct individual laboratory research projects. Students will work as part of a dynamic research team investigating a basic problem in cellular or molecular biology. Students will become familiar with the research techniques of microbiology, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology using modern equipment and facilities in the Department of Bacteriology. Students will attend professional seminars and make written and oral presentations of their own research findings. The Department has an established record of providing research opportunities for undergraduate students and has successfully administered summer REU Programs for students since 1988. The Department will fund ten students per year for a nine-week intensive research experience.\r\n\r\n",
