Field collecting in tropical and temperate regions, along with study of museum collections and laboratory cultures, provides the materials for study of the morphology and growth, life cycles, and association between asexual (anamorphic) and sexual (teleomorphic) phases of these widespread but poorly known fungi, which include wood-rotting organisms, soil saprobes and pathogens, endophytes, commensals in ant and termite nests, and termite-gut symbionts. Some species are known sources of toxic compounds with antibiotic properties, and Dr. Rogers' culturing studies have provided the means for further analyses of these mycotoxins and their effects.\r\n\tThe sampling, describing, and naming of the biological diversity of the Earth continue in the hands of taxonomic specialists as a fundamental activity in biology. The fungi in particular, because of their small size and often obscure activities, are poorly known in most parts of the world, yet are important in numerous ecological processes and offer challenges to evolutionary biologists as well. The basic revisionary and monographic research proceeding from studies by Dr. Rogers and his colleagues worldwide reveals the full diversity of form and life cycle in these xylariaceous fungi, provides reliable indicators for identifying individual species and for associating their sexual and asexual strains, and lays the groundwork for further ecological and phylogenetic investigations.\r\n\r\n",
