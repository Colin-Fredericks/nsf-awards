 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis award was made under the NSF CAREER Program and is supported jointly by the Atmospheric Chemistry and the Experimental Physical Chemistry Programs. \r\n\tThe research component of this project consists of experimental chemical kinetics measurements that address the role of the methyl peroxy radical (CH3O2) in tropospheric and stratospheric processes, with a focus on reactions which may affect ozone destruction and production cycles. A secondary objective is to further the development of the chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) technique as a promising new method for both laboratory and field detection of atmospheric species. The turbulent flow-CIMS method will be used to measure rates at temperature and pressure conditions characteristic of the troposphere and lower stratosphere. In addition, sensitive and selective chemical ionization schemes will be developed for measurements at low absolute concentrations and for unambiguous monitoring of reactants and products. \r\n\tThe primary objective of the education plan is to enhance the quality of Hope College's chemistry program through a systematic implementation of innovative teaching techniques and by introducing environmental chemistry topics in both the classroom and the undergraduate research setting. Collaborative learning techniques will be used, and research-related case studies will be incorporated into the teaching.\r\n\r\n",
