 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to current thinking on undergraduate science education, this project involves a revision of the chemistry laboratory curriculum in an effort to give students more direct experience with the methods and process of scientific inquiry.  Traditional, \"cookbook\" laboratories often do not engage students in what chemists really do.  By introducing multi-week, project-based labs into the chemistry curriculum, students experience the discovery process and improve their problem solving and critical thinking skills.  In addition, as high field FT-NMR is integrated into all of the project-based labs, it becomes an essential tool for students to solve chemical problems.  \r\n\r\nIn our work, project-based/NMR labs adapted from the Journal of Chemical Education are introduced into the organic and inorganic chemistry courses.  In the sophomore organic laboratories the \"guided inquiry\" technique published by Spencer et al. (J. Chem. Ed., 1998) and the NSF-sponsored project of Olmstead (No. USE-9250902) is adapted and implemented in order to introduce students to 1H NMR.  In that same course, 13C NMR and DEPT and COSY techniques are introduced by the adaptation and implementation of the NSF sponsored work of Reeves and Chaney (J. Chem. Ed., 1998) as well as that of Branz et al. (No. USE-9151729).  In the inorganic laboratory course multi-nuclear NMR techniques are introduced by adapting the work of Schreiner et al. (No. DUE-9452264) and that of Richmond et al. (J. Chem. Ed., 1991).  A new, advanced NMR methods course is incorporated into the curriculum and includes experiments similar to those of Mills (J. Chem. Ed., 1996), which involve advanced techniques like NOE and HETCORR, coupled with molecular modeling.  Subsequently, project-based/NMR labs are also adapted and implemented into the physical chemistry and biochemistry courses.\r\n",
