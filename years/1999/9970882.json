 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nMitchell\r\n\r\nThis project concerns the study of heat kernel analysis on Lie groups and its dependence on the geometry of the group. This is motivated \r\nby the philosophy that the heat kernel on a Riemannian manifold is the natural analog of the Gaussian on Euclidean space. The techniques \r\ninvolved draw from the fields of functional analysis, Lie theory, differential geometry, and probability theory. A primary goal of the project is to \r\nexamine the recently developed notion of \"Hermite\" functions on Lie groups; Hermite functions are analogs of the classical Hermite \r\npolynomials. Just as the classical Hermite polynomials are basic objects in harmonic analysis on Euclidean space with respect to a \r\nGaussian measure, Hermite functions are fundamental in harmonic analysis on Lie groups with respect to the heat kernel measure. The \r\nprincipal investigator will examine these Hermite functions, their relationship to questions in harmonic analysis and representation theory, and \r\nproperties of transforms relating function spaces on Lie groups to other Hilbert spaces. Specifically, the principal investigator proposes to \r\nextend his recent work by characterizing the asymptotic behavior of Hermite functions, investigating their image under the Segal-Bargmann-\r\nHall Transform, and relating the Hermite functions on compact Lie groups and their complexifications to the unitary representations of these \r\ngroups. Additionally, a goal is to develop a parallel theory for general noncompact Lie groups and to investigate the possibility of generalizing \r\nthe classical Fourier-Wiener Transform to the group setting. Finally, the principal investigator will study the extension of the above \r\nconsiderations to include the infinite dimensional groups consisting of continuous paths into a finite dimensional Lie group.\r\n\r\nThis research is motivated by mathematical problems stemming from quantum physics. In particular, this project has grown out of work \r\nrelated to quantum field theories. Physicists use quantum field theories to predict the behavior of the elementary particles. However, these \r\ntheories are in a mathematically primitive state. This project will illuminate mathematical structures associated to these quantum field \r\ntheories. As a consequence, the results may have an impact on developing rigorous physical theories of the subatomic particles.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
