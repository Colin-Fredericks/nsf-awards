This project focuses on using code shipping to optimize execution performance in distributed systems.  Code shipping involves statically extracting code fragments form an existing program, constructing executable parcels written in a language such as Java from the fragments, and shipping the parcels to another machine for execution.  An example use of code shipping is to implement call folding to remote procedure calls (RPCs), where multiple RPCs from a client to a server are folded into a single RPC.  The program fragment that performs the calls, including any intervening statements, is extracted and generated as a parcel at compile time, and then shipped to the server at run time as an argument in the single remaining RPC and executed there.  Thus, the calls to the server operations that originally required network transmissions are now local.  In contrast to previous approached, code shipping involves automatic generation of parcels and other software components from regular source code, typically involves finer-grain fragments, and emphasizes performance optimization rather than function enhancement.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to explore code shipping as a technique for optimizing execution in distributed systems.  The issues being investigated range from identifying optimization possibilities in the code to developing appropriate transformation techniques.  Our investigations are based on pragmatic approached to the problem, with the work being done in the context of building a prototype code shipping sys\r\n",
