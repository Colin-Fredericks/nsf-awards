 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Andrew Gewirth at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is examining the structure and reactivity of several electrode reactions, using a variety of electrochemical and scanning probe microscopic methods.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, he is considering the electroreduction of oxygen, peroxide, and nitrate on underpotential deposition modified surfaces.  He is also investigating the structure of small molecule adsorbates, including specifically polyoxometallates,  on electrode surfaces and correlating that with the structure and function of the monolayer.  Studies of the structure of solvents on electrode surfaces using UHV methods are also underway.  A detailed understanding of the connection between structure and reactivity of modified electrode surfaces is important for the understanding and subsequent design of electrochemical catalysts, fuel cell electrodes, and electrochemical sensors.  \r\n\r\nIn order to develop improved electrodes for fuel cell and sensor applications, a detailed understanding of the structure of the electrode surface must be obtained.  When coupled with measures of the reactivity of these modified surfaces, design criteria can be developed.  This research project focusses on obtaining this structure-function correlation for a number of important electrochemical processes, including electroreduction, solvent interactions, and surface modification by inorganic overlayers.  This information will be useful for the design of improved sensors and electrocatalysts.\r\n",
