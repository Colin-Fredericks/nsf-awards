 "awd_abstract_narration": "9980814\r\nAustin\r\n\r\nThe PI's propose to develop a pioneering technology which exploits specifically a combination of nanotechnology, new physics in fractionation technology and single-molecule molecular biology.  They believe that only by breaking away from conventional techniques can the true potential of chip technology be exploited.  The two principle investigators for this project are superbly qualified to carry out this work.  Professor Stephen Chou (Department of Electrical Engineering) is a world leader in nanofabrication technologies and has pioneered the development of nanoimprint lithography while Professor Robert Austin (Department of Physics) has been a pioneer in the applications of microfabrication in molecular and cellular biology.\r\n\r\nMost efforts at using chip technology to do sequencing of DNAmolecules have concentrated on the shrinking of capillary electrophoresis channels onto the surface of silicon wafer.  The problem with this technology is that without creating explicitly on the chip a change in the basic polymer physics by which the molecules are fractionated the resolving power of the devices is limited by the short length of the channels on the wafer.  In other words, these efforts do not take full advantage of the design freedom that lithographic techniques offer to an imaginative designer.  A more powerful aspect of chip technology is also the potential to do single molecule genomic analysis in a massively parallel manner using nanoscale engineering and nanoimprint lithography.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work consists of 3 related projects: (1) nanofabrication of obstacle arrays with characteristic spacings of 30-600 manometers to be used for the construction of synthetic gels for fractionation of oligonucleotides; (2) nanofabrication of asymmetrical arrays which use rectified brownian motion for the continuous fractionation of biological molecules; (3) nanofabrication of near-field excitation slits and channels for ultra-high spatial reading of tagged genomic DNA.\r\n\r\nThis proposal offers the next step forward in the engineering of nanostructures on chip for the fractionation of biological molecules and the sequencing of single molecules.  The technology described could become the basis for the future evolution of nanobiology and nanoengineering of a biology lab on a chip.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
