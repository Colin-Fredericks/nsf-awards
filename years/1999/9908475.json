Hart, Sr.\r\nMercer University, Georgia\r\n\r\nDr. Hart has demonstrated exceptional leadership in inspiring students in their development of discipline, self-esteem and self-worth.  During the 1980s, Prof. Hart envisioned and initiated a program which identified and developed minority and underprivileged students in middle school who had the potential to succeed in mathematics and science-related disciplines. He has also been a pivotal influence upon hundreds of young minority high school students in Middle Georgia, many of whom became first-generation college students.  Of the 103 African American students mentored by Dr. Hart, fifty-four have earned baccalaureate degrees, twenty-six have earned master's degrees and twenty-five have earned doctoral or medical degrees.  \r\n",
