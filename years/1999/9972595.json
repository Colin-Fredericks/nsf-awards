 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972595\r\nClark\r\nFires play an integral role in the vegetation and climate dynamics of the boreal forest and contribute significantly to the amount of aerosols and gases in the atmosphere both today and in the past. An understanding of the interaction between long-term climate changes and fire regime is critical to our understanding of how future fire dynamics will be effected by climate and vegetation. In order to understand how fire dynamics will be affected by future climate change and vegetation changes, it is imperative to determine how past climate and vegetation shifts have changed past fire regimes. This dissertation research focuses on the prevalence of fire in different climate regions and during past climate changes in Western Canada and Alaska, in order to determine sensitivity of fire regimes to climate changes. The research will reconstruct fossilized charcoal and pollen records across modern climate moisture gradients and past climate and vegetation changes. This will allow assessment of the importance of fire under these different climate and vegetation conditions.\r\n",
