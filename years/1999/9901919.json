Exploring Time will engage visitors in experiences about the natural world that reveal their own abilities to see change over time and to help them see the world in a new way.  Through the use of computers, multimedia technology, science apparatus and real objects, visitors will be able to explore the vast world of phenomena that happen too quickly or too slowly for humans to perceive.  Vignettes of scientists from a broad array of disciplines will highlight currrent research, show scientists as role models for young people, and demonstrate how compressing and expanding time is a conceptual technique used in many fields of scientific endeavor.  Interactive experiments that challenge human perception of time and duration will make personal for visitors their limits and compel them to ask questions scientists do:  How can I know about changes that happen outside my perceptions?  The exhibition will open at the Science Museum of Minnesota in October, 2001, and then tour to 12 to 15 large- and medium-sized museums around the country, reaching a projected audience of over 2.5 million.\r\n",
