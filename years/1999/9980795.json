The biomimetic processing technique, called the Polymer-Induced Liquid-Precursor (PILP) process, is currently being developed by the PI for the deposition of mineral films under low-temperature and aqueous-based conditions. These benign processing conditions should be amenable to the incorporation of thermally sensitive ingredients, which will be capitalized on in the proposed methodology. The novelty of the PILP process is that an acidic polyelectrolyte (polyaspartic acid) transforms a traditional solution crystallization process into a solidification process by sequestering ions and inducing phase separation of a mineral precursor. This precursor is in the form of a moderately viscous liquid, and can be molded and shaped by a compartment. The hallmark of biomineralization is the ability of organisms to \"mold\" inorganic crystals within vesicular compartments, thus it is hypothesized that this PILP process may play a fundamental role in the morphogenesis of calcitic biominerals. Therefore, the first goal of the proposed work is to demonstrate \"micromolding\" of calcite using microfabrication techniques.\r\n\r\nPatterning of the inorganic phase will be investigated by the following two approaches: 1) soft lithography\" micromolding of a PILP precursor, or 2) solid freeform fabrication of ceramic precursor generated by a Temperature Induced Forming (TIF) process. The channels of the patterned inorganic layer will subsequently be filled in by polymerization of a secondary phase for planarization of the layer (polycinnamic acid is chosen as the testbed). Rapid prototyping will then be used to sequentially deposit numerous thin layers, in order to construct a three-dimensional composite structure of controlled architecture, the second goal of the project. In many ways, this layer-by-layer fabrication scheme is similar to the processes that occur naturally in biomineralization; whereby computer-aided design (CAD) allows for the spatial control of the sequential depositions, which is accomplished by cellular processes in biological systems.\r\n\r\nA third goal of the project is to demonstrate the incorporation of biological components into scaffolding structures, and in a spatially uniform and controlled fashion. The Urease-urea enzyme system will be used for a testbed, in order to determine if the process denatures the protein. The spatial distribution of the protein will be examined by fluorescent and immunogold labeling of protein. The work proposed herein will demonstrate feasibility of the approach, and begin to acquire the tools necessary for developing a generalized methodology for customized composites for a variety of applications, such as the following:\r\n\r\nBio receptor Microsystems: a high degree of spatial regulation of biological components will be a necessary feature for the future of hybridization of microelectronics with bioreceptor species.\r\n\r\nDrug Delivery- a biodegradable mineral phase with optimal biocompatibility for the slow release of agents encapsulated within the mineral phase.\r\n\r\nMicroencapsulation of Cells and Tissue Engineering: a porous framework of a biodegradable phase containing bone morphogenetic proteins for application as osteoinductive bone-graft substitutes, or for encapsulation of osteoprogenitor cells for in vitro hard-tissue engineering (or other tissues). Likewise, a porous framework could provide a cage for Islet cells, enabling through flow of physiological media and biologically-controlled release of insulin for treatment of diabetes, while isolating the foreign cells to prevent immunogenic response.\r\n\r\nBioseparations: structuring of the framework in three-dimensions will enable controlled porosity and porosity gradients for size-specific separations and chromatography, that along with the capability of incorporation of bioconstituents, will be particularly amenable to bioseparations.\r\n\r\nBiocatalysis: Using the benign biomimetic process, enzymes could be incorporated into the framework to fabricate a porous catalytic media, and possibly with controlled orientation of the protein through surface interactions with framework for optimal presentation of catalytic site.\r\n\r\n",
