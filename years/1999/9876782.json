 "awd_abstract_narration": "After rapid expansion in the 1960 to early 1980s, the Invertebrate Paleontology Collection of the Oklahoma of Natural History underwent a period of minimal growth that followed the retirement of the curator, Patrick K. Sutherland.  Without a curator, collection activity declinced significantly and many of the original wooden cases have been damaged through termite infestation.  And yet, the collection is among the largest in the museum (250,000 specimens) and contains several thousand type and figured specimens from a number of landmark studies on the paleontology of Oklahoma and contiguous state.  The University of Oklahoma has renewed its commitment to the collection with the hiring of a new curator who will be assisted by a new, full-time curatorial specialist.  A large storage area (approximately 3,200 square feet)has been allocated to the collection in the Sam Noble Museum of Natural History, a new facility which will be available early in 1999.  Restoration of the collection will be a multi-year project, the first phase of which will ensure that the specimens are unpacked promptly and adequately housed in metal cases.  Subsequent phases will involve production of a catalogue of type and figured specimens in both conventional print and electronic (web-based) media, and computerization of collection records, which are currently stored on a set of index cards.  This project will complete the replacement of antiquated wooden storage cabinets with new metal cases and support the hiring of temporary staff to assist with the unpacking and reorganization of the collection following the move to the new facility.  This project is clearly critical to the successful completion of subsequent phases of the restoration.",
