 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research studies the design of agile wireless networks that\r\naccommodate time variations in the communication channels, the\r\ninformation sources, and the network topology.\r\nThe research will lead to design principles that, in addition to \r\nenabling more efficient use of the current cellular and PCS bands, will allow \r\nexploitation of frequency bands in the 10-100 GHz range to provide high-speed \r\nmultimedia services for both indoor and outdoor applications.  While the basic \r\ncellular paradigm of wireless access to a high-speed communication and\r\ncomputing backbone will be adhered to, nearly every other assumption\r\nin existing second-generation and projected third-generation cellular\r\nand PCS networks will be reexamined.  Some of the significant differences\r\nfrom current designs are as follows.  A dense network of base stations\r\nwill provide connectivity despite the high path losses\r\nand sharp shadowing at higher frequency bands.  Cells with\r\nwell-defined boundaries may no longer exist, and mobile terminals will\r\nsee a rapidly varying network topology.  A variety of traffic classes,\r\nsuch as voice, data, and video, with diverse requirements regarding\r\ndelay, loss, quality of reproduction, and number of potential receivers\r\nwill be considered.\r\n\r\nThe integrated research effort is being conducted by five overlapping\r\nresearch teams of University of Illinois faculty investigators and\r\ntheir students, organized around the following interdisciplinary projects:\r\n(1) Concept Systems, Modeling, and Performance Limits,\r\n(2) Design Principles for Wireless Packet Networks,\r\n(3) Design for Time-Varying Channels,\r\n(4) Jointly Optimized Source Coding, Channel Coding, and Estimation, and\r\n(5) VLSI Algorithms, Architectures, and Bounds.\r\nThe investigators are applying their expertise in digital signal\r\nprocessing, communication systems, networking, circuit design and control.\r\nA diverse array of methods will be applied, including modeling\r\nand simulation, application of adaptive and universal algorithm\r\nmethodologies, exploitation of antenna arrays and polarization for\r\ndiversity and beamforming, algebraic coding techniques, linear and nonlinear\r\noptimization techniques, information theory, and laboratory\r\nimplementation and measurement.",
