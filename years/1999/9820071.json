The workshop will be held in association with the Second International Mechatronics Conference.  The Principal Investigator is Professor Sabri Tosunoglu, of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Florida International University.  The Turkish co-organizer is Dr. Okyay Kaynak, Professor and Chairman, Department of Electrical Engineering at Bosphorus University in Istanbul.  The objectives of the workshop and conference are to disseminate the recent advances in this area, provide a forum to actively seek cooperation between the participants and their institutions, and to discuss future research directions, and especially to identify opportunities for collaboration by US and Turkish scientists.  The topics to be covered will include: mechatronics design, distributed systems, vision and sensors, robots and mobile machines, vibration and control, computational intelligence in mechatronics, embedded real-time systems, micro mechatronics, motion control, hardware/software co-design, intelligent manufacturing systems, and education and training in mechatronics.\r\n\r\nScope:  This project will bring together 10 well known American scientists, from different institutions, who are experts in various topics in the fields of mechanics and electronics with their counterparts in Turkey to identify areas for joint research.  This meeting will also enable the US scientists to interact with scientists from European countries and from other countries and to attend informative presentations about this important field exploring the advances made in computer and electronics technologies.  The Turkish organizer, Dr. Kaynak, is the UNESCO Mechatronics Chair at Bosphorus University, and is a well-known authority in this field.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting joint binational workshops that are likely to increase collaboration in areas of mutual interest. \r\n",
