Torian/Princeton U.\r\n\r\nMuch of the effort devoted to understanding the dynamics or no-equilibrium behavior of a surfactant monolayer spreading on thin liquids films has fallen on the side of theoretical models.  Despite the increasing attention paid to the theoretical aspects of this problem, the models have yet to be tested in any detail experimentally.\r\n\r\nThis proposal outlines experimental studies with real lung surfactants on a liquid support the closely approximates the constituency and composition of the lining in the alveolar sacs.  The surfactant solutions are commercially available and represent both natural and\r\nSynthetic surfactant mixtures used in clinical studies.  Area wide refractive Moire topography will be used to measure the time variant surface slope during the spreading event.  From this data the entire time variant film shape and the speed of the spreading front can be reconstructed.  In particular, the rate of thinning close to the surfactant source, a region which is highly susceptible to film rupture and the formation of arterial spreading patterns, will be quantified.  From theoretical considerations, most of the variables affecting the spreading process are unknown.  Experimentally, it is planned to quantify the relationship between the film shape and surfactant speed as a function of these variables.  It is also planned to concentrate on the role of the initial shear stress, which controls the degree of  film thinning and therefore the mass of surfactant actually delivered to distal regions.\r\n\r\nThe POWRE, program will provide critical funding for a 12 month period to conduct the first set of spreading experiments in this field.  Given the principal investigator's (PI's) lack of formal training in biomedical engineering, it has been practically impossible to secure funding for these type of studies from the biomedical community.  Given the success in formulating the mathematical framework for the spreading dynamics and given the previous experience in carrying out experimental studies using Moire topology, laser shadowgraphy and laser interferometry, the PI is confident that a one time infusion of funds can launch this experimental program.  This funding will help run these studies to be published in the biomedical literature, which is a new area for the (PI).  These results will hopefully convince the biomedical community that the PI is  knowledgeable in the area of lung surfactant spreading and that her training in fluid physics can contribute significantly to this important problem. \r\n    \r\n",
