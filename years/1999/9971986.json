 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies three classes of problems related\r\nto fluid and geophysical fluid dynamics.  The first class of\r\nproblems involves connections between the Navier-Stokes equations\r\nof incompressible fluids and conventional turbulence theory.  The\r\ninvestigator studies links between the estimates of energy\r\ndissipation rate of three-dimensional boundary-driven flows based\r\non the Navier-Stokes equations and Kolmogorov's heuristic\r\nestimate of energy dissipation rate for turbulent flows, and\r\nconnections between the asymptotic degrees of freedom predicted\r\nby the Navier-Stokes equations (either as the fractal dimension\r\nof the global or exponential attractor, or as the number of\r\ndetermining modes, nodes or volume of the system) and those from\r\nconventional turbulence theory in combination with the heuristic\r\nLandau-Lifschitz argument.  The second class of problems is\r\nboundary layer behavior associated with incompressible viscous\r\nfluids whose dynamics are governed by the Navier-Stokes\r\nequations.  Both the case with non-permeable boundary and the case\r\nwith permeable boundary are studied.  Results are checked via\r\nnumerical simulation and laboratory data.  Some relevant efficient\r\nnumerical algorithms are developed as well.  The third clas of\r\nproblems is related to geophysical flows, emphasizing emergence\r\nand persistence of large scale coherent structures based on the\r\nbarotropic quasi-geostrophic model.  Three prototype problems are\r\nstudied.  The first is a selective decay problem for geophysical\r\nflows that predicts the emergence of Rossby waves directly from\r\nthe dynamic equations.  The second is a spin-up problem with\r\nrandom forcing of small scale positive vortices.  The third is\r\nthe barotropic quasi-geostrophic equations on the sphere.\r\n     Fluids are indispensable to our life.  They range from the\r\nair we breathe and water we drink to oceans and atmosphere that\r\ncover the surface of our the earth.  Study of the motion of these\r\nfluids is crucial to us.  At this stage full resolution of the\r\ncomplete dynamic equations lies beyond the capability of the most\r\npowerful computing system available today.  Hence approximation\r\nmethods (both numerical and asymptotic) are needed to provide\r\nqualitative and quantitative results on the behavior of the\r\nfluids for simplified but prototypical situations.  The problems\r\nproposed here are prototypical and understanding them will\r\nfacilitate our understanding of fundamental concepts related to\r\nfluid and geophysical fluid dynamics.  Study of these typical\r\nexamples will further our understanding of more realistic and\r\nsophisticated problems that are important in many engineering\r\napplications (such as wing design or turbulent combustion) as\r\nwell as in weather prediction, climatology and environmental\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n",
