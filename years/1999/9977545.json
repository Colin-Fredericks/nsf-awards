Fourier transform photoluminescence spectroscopy (FTPLS) will be used to study the optical properties of SiGeSnC group IV bulk alloys, heterostructures, quantum confined structures, and devices.  FTPLS will be utilized to study the bandgaps of the alloys, variation of the bandgap due to the concentration of alloy constituents and strain, defects and impurities, and optical processes in group IV materials and devices.  This will enhance basis understanding and address specific unresolved issues about the variation of the bandgap due to alloying and strain, that is crucial in the design of devices that utilize bandgap engineering to create quantum confined structures.  The FT-IR spectrometer component of the FTPLS system will be used to examine the vibrational structure of the material as well as the bandgap.  The instrumentation will be used for research, research training, and integrated research/education activities.  Graduate students will utilize the instrumentation for research towards their master's degree in the physics graduate program.   They also will be used as mentors for undergraduate research training.  Also, the instrumentation will be used to engage undergraduates in small research projects during the academic year and summer months, and for integrated research/education in courses that are presently offered in the junior and senior years of the undergraduate programs in physics, and physics with engineering emphasis.  Experiments utilizing the equipment will be integrated in the laboratory sections of undergraduate courses offered in the Department of Physics and Pre-Engineering. \r\n\r\nMajor Research Instrumentation funds will be used to acquire Fourier transform photoluminescence spectroscopy instrumentation that will be used to study a variety of optical and vibrational properties of semiconducting alloys, heterostructures, quantum confined structures, and devices.  This instrument will have a large impact on the research infrastructure, as well on the research training at Delaware State University, which is a minority institution.\r\n",
