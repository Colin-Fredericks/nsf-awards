The objective of the research program is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the plastic response of reinforced metals (especially particulate-reinforced and fiber-reinforced aluminum) subjected to multiaxial loading.  A study of reinforced aluminum will be performed to provide a multiaxial description of overall plasticity associated with constrained plastic flow in the metallic matrix.  Contours of constant plastic flow will be experimentally determined for internal pressure-axial-torsional loading of reinforced tubular specimens, then utilized, with the help of micromechanics, to develop a macroscale continuum model.  The primary educational goal is to present mechanics issues to students in a more participatory environment, that is, one in which the students experience mechanics rather than passively learn about it.  The primary educational activity is the development of an undergraduate course that emphasizes the integration of mechanics theory, numerical computations, and experiments through study of real manufactured products and structural elements.\r\n",
