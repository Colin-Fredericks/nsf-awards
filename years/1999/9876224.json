 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses research on basic properties on nanoparticles and the measurement of current unexplored properties such as photodetachment and photoionization.  It is suggested that photodetachment of electrons due to UV radiation is an important, to date neglected effect which can lead to more positively charged particles and that it could explain the fast coagulation growth of particles observed experimentally.  An experiment to measure the particle photodetachment cross sections is proposed.  Negatively charged particles will be grown in, extracted from a pulsed plasma and sent through a UV photodetachment chamber.  An excimer lamp will be used to generate narrow-band UV radiation over a wide wavelength range.  An electrostatic analyzer will be used to determine the fraction of particles which have experienced photodetachment.  The results may lead to an understanding of particle growth in semiconductor plasmas and possibly may show a way to avoid coagulation growth of \"killer particles.\"\r\n\r\nThe educational plan focuses on creating awareness and transmitting excitement about the research area of plasma processing and nanoparticle research.  High school students will get a first hand impression of research through short lectures and laboratory visits.  High school teachers will be invited to participate in research activities during the summer and be advised in developing exciting \"dusty plasma\" related classroom experiments.  Undergraduate students will be addressed through course development and development of interactive, computer-based teaching materials.  Students will experience the excitement of research by working with a research grade plasma simulation code on \"virtual plasmas\" and by having the opportunity to compare their results to \"real\" plasmas in laboratory demonstrations.  They will also have the opportunity of direct research involvement through research assistantships, and honors thesis projects.  Graduate students will benefit from the program, in particular, through the opportunity of international exchange.\r\n",
