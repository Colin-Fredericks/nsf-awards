 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the impact of recent regulatory reforms\r\nin the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on new drug safety\r\nin the U.S. pharmaceutical market.  Since the agency introduced\r\nprescription drug user fees in 1993, the speed of FDA review for new\r\ndrugs has increased.  Although new drugs are being approved faster,\r\nthere have also been several newly approved drugs that were withdrawn\r\nfrom the market because of safety reasons.  This suggests that there\r\nmay be a trade-off between the speed of FDA review and new\r\ndrug safety.  This analysis will empirically investigate how\r\nthe length of an FDA-approved drug's review time and how important\r\nchanges in the regulatory or political environment such as the\r\nintroduction of user fees impact new drug safety.  To examine this\r\nrelationship, this analysis will utilize data from the FDA's\r\nSpontaneous Reporting System (SRS) which is a computerized database of\r\nadverse drug reactions (ADR) reported to the FDA under its\r\npost-marketing surveillance program called MedWatch.  This data will be\r\nused to construct measures of new drug safety for the 1990-1995\r\napprovals.  These measures will be used to explore patterns and sources\r\nof variation in new drug safety over time.\r\n\r\nThe user fee program is one of the few reforms introduced in the last\r\ntwenty years to significantly increase the speed of the FDA review\r\nprocess for new drugs.  While the program has received a positive\r\nevaluation from politicians and pharmaceutical firms, there has been\r\nno subsequent analysis of the effects of this reform on consumer safety\r\noutcomes.  The goal of this analysis is to provide a more thorough\r\nunderstanding of the effects of this reform on new drug safety.\r\nResults from this analysis will help policy makers better understand\r\nand evaluate the impact of the user fee program on the market for\r\npharmaceuticals.  In addition, there has been little investigation in\r\nthe pharmaceutical regulatory literature of the impact of regulatory\r\nchange on consumer safety outcomes because of the difficulty in\r\nobserving and quantifying new drug safety.  This study will utilize a\r\nmedical database to develop proxies for new drug safety that can be\r\nused in the proposed study and in future economic analyses of\r\npharmaceutical regulation.  Finally, political efforts to increase\r\nagency accountability have led to many different reforms in different\r\nagencies. However, the reasons why certain reforms succeed while other\r\nreforms fail are often not well understood.  One reason is that politicians\r\nfail to understand how different reforms alter bureaucratic incentives\r\nand the trade-offs facing regulators. The data and results from this\r\nstudy will address these important issues and help provide a better\r\nfoundation for developing and evaluating future FDA reforms.\r\n\r\nThe investigator's recent transition from an economics department to a\r\nDivision of health policy and management within a school of public health\r\nMarks an important change in her career path.  The POWRE grant will greatly\r\nfacilitate this transition and improve her chances of succeeding in her new\r\nenvironment.  Second, this research represents the begining of a new approach\r\nfor examining the impact of regulatory change on pharmaceutical safety.\r\nGiven such data has not previously been utilized by economists, this project\r\nis perhaps more exploratory in nature to determine the pros and cons of\r\n(i)using this data to measure changes in pharmaceutical safety over time;\r\nand (ii) using this data to examine how user fees have altered the trade-offs\r\nfacing FDA regulators.\r\n\r\n",
