The project would improve these assessment practices by:  (1) creating a conceptual and practical framework that can guide effective use of journals by teachers and students;  (2) creating a pilot teacher enhancement program that, by using science journals as an example of a classroom assessment, helps teachers reflect on and improve their formative assessment practices, and improve their own content knowledge; and  (3) exploring the impact of the implementation of the professional development program on teachers' formative assessment practices and on their students' performance.\r\n\r\nFour to six teachers from the San Francisco School District will participate in this exploratory  project.  The evaluation of their professional development experience will focus on its impact by comparing the teachers' assessment practices, specifically the quality of their feedback, with student performance before and after the implementation of the professional development activity.  The design of the study will include data on the same teachers' journal feedback practices and their students' achievement in a prior study with no staff development intervention.  \r\n\r\nThe next step in this effort if the enhancement strategy proves successful will be to revise, implement, evaluate and disseminate this type of professional development in a larger context. \r\n",
