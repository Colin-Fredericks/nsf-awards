 "awd_abstract_narration": "9820230\r\nZangwill\r\nThis award supports education and research on magnetism and magnetic moments at surfaces.  Magnetic moments near monoatomic step edges experience anisotropy to spin rotation that differs from that of moments in the bulk.  This difference is a consequence of the spin-orbit interaction at step edges where low site symmetry leads to poor quenching of atomic orbital angular momentum.   The proposed theoretical work focuses on two aspects of surface magnetism: macroscopic (classical) and microscopic (quantum). \r\nAt the classical level, the PI proposes to study the magnetization dynamics of spatially inhomogeneous magnetic states that are impressed on an island morphology typical of as-grown epitaxial films.   Conjugate gradient and spin relaxation numerical methods will be used to simulate an appropriate Heisenberg block spin model with magnetostatics, global four-fold anisotropy, and local two-fold anisotropy at island edges.  One focus is on the mobility of a Neel magnetic domain wall as a function of the step anisotropy strength and the complexity of the growth morphology.  A second problem is the formation of and dynamics of XY-type vortex states rendered locally stable by the step edge anisotropy. \r\nAt the quantum level, the PI will study orbital-magnetism using current-density functional theory, which is needed to capture the vestiges of Hund's rules that must occur at step edges due to incomplete angular momentum quenching.  Simple models will be studied at first, but a long-term goal is to develop a practical method for performing calculations on more sophisticated and realistic models.  Another aim of this work is to seek a formal basis for the phenomenological Maxwell equations for matter. \r\n%%%\r\nThis award is for research and education in the theory of magnetism at surfaces of materials.  The PI's approach involves the study of surface phenomena involving magnetism on long length scales and the development of new computational methods to determine how magnetism arises from atoms in microscopic environments with lower symmetry than that for an atom in the bulk.  Such environments occur at surfaces and these techniques may contribute to the development of future nanotechnologies.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
