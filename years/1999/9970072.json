 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project of Professor R. Griffith Freeman at Truman State University, supported by Analytical and Surface Chemistry,  has two primary goals.  The first goal is preparation of a new type of surface for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) experiment.  This surface consists of alkanethiolate-coated metal nanoparticles, where the metal is either gold or silver.  The use of coated nanoparticles allows SERS studies for chemical samples that do not exhibit an attraction for the bare metal, but do have an attraction for the organic coating.    The second goal is careful use of SERS to study interactions occurring at the metal thiolate interface.  The coated nanoparticles are analogs of self-assembled monolayers on flat metal surfaces and the conclusions drawn  extend to such systems studied in other laboratories.  The work is supported as a Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project.\r\n\r\nSurface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is used to obtain structural information about molecules that cannot be studied using the more typical infrared spectroscopy.  SERS requires that the sample be in close physical contact with gold or silver particles of very small size.  Professor Freeman and his undergraduate student researchers will coat the small silver and gold particles with an organic coating so that more molecules will be attracted to the metal surface, and therefore SERS spectra can be recorded for these additional molecules.\r\n\r\n",
