 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hampton University\r\n\r\nHampton University is requesting of the National Science Foundation support in the amount of $2,997,110 for the development and implementation of an HBCU Undergraduate program that will offer: (1) support for opportunities for curriculum enhancement in the development of interdisciplinary programs and research; and (2) a Pre-Freshmen Summer Science Institute Program that is targeted for entering freshman students; (3) faculty development opportunities that will impact the quality of instruction and research; (4) scholarships for qualified students; (5) an Integrated Learning Environment (ILE) for science majors, and (6) a plan to enhance and expand undergraduate research. The pre-freshman summer science institute is specially oriented toward the preparation of students to enter the freshman year of college with strong backgrounds in quantitative subject matter and communication skills that will help facilitate their entry into a challenging program at the undergraduate level. The undergraduate programs in the School of Science will be enhanced through (1) faculty developmental activities including retraining and other enrichment experiences at renown research centers; and (2) a Visiting Scientist Lecture series that will become an important resource in the offering of new courses; and participation in seminars, workshops and other enrichment activities.  Existing interdisciplinary research projects at the university will benefit significantly from the new dimension that the HBCU Undergraduate Program will bring to the undergraduate disciplines. These include biological sciences, chemistry, communicative sciences  computer science, mathematics, and physics. The HBCU Program will help underwrite the costs for additional faculty and staff, equipment, teaching and resource supplies, and the attendance of students and faculty at relevant professional meetings.\r\nAnticipated outcomes of the program are: (1) a significant increase in the number of minority students who will pursue teaching and research careers in some of the frontier areas of the interdisciplinary sciences such as astrobiology bio-engineering, computer engineering, atmospheric sciences and environmental sciences; and (2) the development of a model program that other institutions having a similar mission may wish to emulate.\r\n\r\n",
