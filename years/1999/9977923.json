 "awd_abstract_narration": "More and more organizations are attempting to work long distance.  Since travel is time consuming, exhausting, and costly, they are turning to remote technologies, such as video and audio-conferencing.  High quality video, of course, is much more expensive than audio, and questions arise as to its efficacy and necessity.  This proposal asks two broad questions:\r\n\r\n1. Under what conditions/tasks is the addition of video over audio truly beneficial?\r\n2. What effect do various conditions of video degradation have on user performance?\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on the effect of the presence or absence of video on tasks deemed key to long-term teams, involving the establishment and maintenance of trust and the detection of deception.  In addition, we test how various reasonable degradations of the channels, those commonly used in making the cost of the connection cheaper, change people's behavior in these situations.  This work has both theoretical and practical import.  Theoretically, it reveals which cues people use when they engage in important social interactions that underlie task-related activities.  Practically, we will be able to provide advice for people who might find themselves in situations involving the building of trust or the detection of lying when that interaction is done remotely.\r\n\r\n",
