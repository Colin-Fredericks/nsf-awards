Self-assembled monolayers of alkanethiolates on gold that present peptide ligands will be used as model substrates that control the interactions between cells and the substrate. The program will develop electroactive monolayers that can modulate, in real time, the activity of immobilized ligands that interact with the surface receptors of attached cells. The strategy is based on the design of electroactive groups that undergo oxidation or reduction when electrical potentials are applied to the underlying gold. When these electroactive groups are incorporated into the structures of ligands immobilized to the monolayers, they can be used to effect changes in the activity of the ligands. This program will deliver three classes of electroactive monolayers that can be used to control the behaviors of attached cells. These include monolayers that selectively release immobilized ligands, monolayers that turn on the activity of immobilized ligands, and monolayers that reversibly modulate the activity of immobilized ligands. A related effort will develop electroactive ligands that can report on the binding of cellular receptors, and hence transduce biological signals into electrical outputs. Because this class of monolayers is designed to efficiently convert electrical signals into biological signals, it represents an add-on capability to the mature technology of integrated circuits. The strategies developed here may be important to designing a broad range of hybrid devices that combine cellular and materials components for use in diagnostics, tissue engineering, indwelling sensors, neural computation, and BioMEMS.\r\n",
