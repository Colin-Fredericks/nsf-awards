 "awd_abstract_narration": "9973638\r\nHall\r\nA delicate balance between maintaining blood flow and the formation of blood clots.  This balance is mediated by the cells (endothelial cells) which line our blood vessels.  The endothelial cell surface can exhibit both pro- and anti- coagulant features depending on the proteins  present on its surface.  Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is one such protein that is produced by endothelial cells and is also presumed to associate with the cell surface in vivo as a means of regulating coagulation.  \r\n\t\r\nTFPI has been shown in vitro to  associate/interact with lipids (phospholipids and lipoproteins), glycosaminoglycans and specific cellular receptors, although it is not clear which of these interactions, or all of them is responsible for maintaining TFPI on the endothelial cell surface.  Purified TFPI also  appears to have a strong affinity for artificial surfaces (laboratory plastics) even in the presence of excess amounts of blocking agents such as albumin.  This \"stickiness\" to biological and non-biological surfaces may make TFPI an appropriate candidate for coating biomaterials or for incorporation into engineered tissue replacements. The goal of this proposal is characterize the interaction of this protein with selected biological and non-biological surfaces of known composition in order to ultimately contribute to an understanding of its interactions with cellular surfaces and to exploit its associative properties in novel biomaterials.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is submitted under the POWRE program because it provides the opportunity to pursue two subject areas (biomaterials and biochemistry of TFPI) that are new to the PI and to perform exploratory research in biomaterials to determine the feasibility of using TFPI as an anti-coagulant coating or additive.  In addition, the opportunity to work at a different institution is critical to the PI's career advancement at this point in time and allows the establishment of independent collaborations.\r\n",
