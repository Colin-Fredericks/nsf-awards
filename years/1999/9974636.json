 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells respond to changes in the nutritional environment by regulating gene expression, thereby controlling and coordinating metabolism and cell division.  The focus of this project is on Rap1p and Gcr1p, which are DNA-binding regulatory proteins found in the nucleus of the model eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  They mediate expression of genes that encode two important classes of metabolic proteins:  translational components and glycolytic enzymes.  Rap1p recruits Gcr1p to specific DNA binding sites upstream from the target genes.  Preliminary results have demonstrated that both proteins are phosphorylated.  These studies will be expanded to elucidate both the significance of these post-translational modifications, and other signaling components involved that might convey signals from the sensory mechanisms at the cell surface.  Two potential connections between phosphorylation and Rap1p/Gcr1p function are of particular interest.  First, Rap1p is phosphorylated within a single tryptic phosphopeptide, and is degraded upon nutrient starvation in a Gcr1p-dependent fashion.  Second, although Gcr1p contains many tryptic phosphopeptides, a single species disappears in the absence of Gcr2p, an ancillary factor that is required for Rap1p/Gcr1p transcriptional activation of glycolytic genes only.  Importantly, the Gcr2p-dependent phosphopeptide reappears in a Dgcr2 suppressor strain in which normal growth and glycolytic enzyme levels are restored.  These and other potential regulatory roles of phosphorylation in this system will be investigated. The results should contribute to an understanding of the important relationship between environmental sensing and the control of cellular metabolism in eukaryotes.",
