Relatively little is konwn about the biodiversity and ecology of these two groups of organisms in cold-dominated, high-latitude regions of the world.  The objective of the proposed research is to carry out the first intensive study of the fungi and beetles associated with various habitats on Campbell Island, a small oceanic island located approximately 700 km south of the New Zealand mainland.  Primary emphasis will be directed towards assessing patterns of distribution, relative abundance, host/substrate associations and ecological roles for mycophagous beetles and four major taxonomic groups of terrestrial fungi.  Secondary emphasis will be placed on lichenized fungi and the various groups of aquatic fungi found in the small streams and lakes that occur on the island.  Data obtained for the assemblages of fungi and beetles on Campbell Island will be compared with similar data that already exist for two other islands (Macquarie Island and South Georgia Island) in the south polar region and comparable areas of the north polar region, including the Alaskan Aleutian Islands.",
