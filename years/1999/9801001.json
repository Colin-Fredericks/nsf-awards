 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801001  White    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is directed at         development of an inexpensive (one step), environmentally benign, selective process for epoxidizing propylene and other olefins. Interest in this process stems from the high production cost of propylene oxide. The Phase II program  will address selective and high rate propylene epoxidation using a process where         electrochemically generated hydrogen peroxide is directly reacted with propylene  over a selective epoxidation catalyst which will be placed in a spatial region very near, but separate from the hydrogen peroxide-generating region of the cathode. The Phase II research effort will consist of optimizing respectively cathode electrocatalyst composition, cathode configuration, and process operating conditions. A scaled up prototype electrochemical cell will be designed, fabricated and operating during this program. Completion of the program will result in an optimized process for selectively and inexpensively converting propylene to propylene oxide at high rates. With a targeted selectivity of the order of 90-100%, it is anticipated that very efficient separation of product electrolyte will be possible. In addition the process will also be capable of cogenerating valuable by products and electricity when operated in the fuel mode.    Successful completion of the proposed. program will result in a one-step process  for the low cost, selective, and high rate synthesis of olefin epoxides using in situ electrochemically generated hydrogen peroxide. The process is potentially  applicable to other oxygenation systems.",
