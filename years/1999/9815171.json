 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Dissertation Improvement Proposal to study the ecology and behavior of a little studied New World monkey, Callimico goeldii.   Preliminary studies indicate that this is an unusual monkey in that it is omnivorous and eats a large amount of fungi in addition to insects, resins and small vertebrates.  The project will take place over the course of a year, allowing observations on their behavior under a variety of circumstances.  \r\n\r\nThe behavior of this species will be compared to that of two related species, Saguinus fusicollis and Saguinus labiatus in northern Bolivia where all three are found.  The dissimilarities in tooth morphology and hand morphology that have been known for sometime likely reflect differences in diet and behavior and suggest that these species will show differences in ecology and habitat requirements.  Comparisons of these species will provide clues towards understanding the specializations of Callimico. Hypotheses will be tested on three major topics: diet, habitat requirements and polyspecific associations.   The co-PI has undertaken initial observations and has demonstrated the ability to obtain the requisite data.  \r\n",
