Based on\r\nwell-established DNA sequencing technology, this system will provide for a\r\nsignificant increase in the productivity and cost effectiveness of\r\nundergraduate/graduate research and education in molecular biology at the\r\nUniversity of Denver. Specific research programs that will benefit\r\nimmediately include National Science Foundation-funded studies on: the\r\nmolecular evolution of endocrine neuropeptide hormones, avian sex\r\nchromosomes, and insect steroidogenesis; the population genetics of\r\nendangered species; the use of  site-directed mutagenesis to delineate the\r\nstructural properties of proteins; and the regulation and ecological\r\nsignificance of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of toxin-metabolizing\r\nenzymes. Additionally, use of the automated sequencer in collaborative\r\nwork in conservation genetics with researchers from the Denver zoological\r\ngardens, will further studies of the genetic diversity of endangered and\r\nthreatened species. \r\n\tBeyond the in-depth training of undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents in the research laboratory setting, a broad range of\r\nclassroom-oriented educational goals will be advanced. Benefits will be\r\nparticularly evident in the molecular-oriented laboratory courses that are\r\nat the heart of the new Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees\r\nin Molecular Biology offered by the Department of Biological Sciences.\r\nDepartment-sponsored biotechnology classes offered to high school students\r\nand teacher-training workshops that promote hands-on science education at\r\nthe secondary school level will also be greatly enhanced. The benefit to\r\nhigh school outreach efforts is immeasurable given that these programs\r\ntarget students in urban and low-income school districts who have\r\ntraditionally been underrepresented in the natural sciences.\r\n\tIn short, acquisition of the CEQ 2000 DNA Sequencing and Sample\r\nPrep Core Unit will provide significant and immediate benefits to\r\neducation at the secondary, undergraduate and graduate levels, while\r\nproviding a cost-efficient means of satisfying the growing DNA sequencing\r\nneeds of researchers funded by the National Science Foundation in both the\r\nDepartment of Biological Sciences and the Department of Chemistry and\r\nBiochemistry.\r\n",
