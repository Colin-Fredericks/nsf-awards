 "awd_abstract_narration": "TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nThrough this initiative, entitled \"Preparing for the Future: Strengthening Basic Science, Mathematics and Biochemistry at Tuskegee University,\" a broad range of activities will occur to enhance the success of students in, science mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET). Specifically, this central goal will be addressed through\r\n\r\n1. - establishing a summer program for rising college sophomores who are highly motivated but have weak backgrounds in science and mathematics;\r\n\r\n2 - strengthening of the first year college chemistry and mathematics courses, through tutorials and establishing a Math Lab;\r\n\r\n3 - expanding and enhancing the biochemistry curriculum, 300- and 500-level, including an interdepartmental lecture lab on the \"Biochemistry of Cell Regulation\";\r\n\r\n4 - developing partnerships with academic institutions having strong and multidisciplinary programs in Biochemistry, especially Georgia State University, Iowa State University, and Michigan State University;\r\n\r\n5 - strengthening industrial partnerships through an external advisory board, with the goal to develop a source of scholarships for promising undergraduate students;\r\n\r\n6 - establishing a resource center/classroom available for mentoring. activities, contacting Tuskegee graduates and others who are currently in graduate school, and generally solving problems which are not directly academic but are part of the student's future; and\r\n\r\n7 - supporting a Ph.D. candidate in the life sciences area who will become among the first to graduate from Tuskegee University with the doctorate degree.\r\n\r\nAll these activities will be carefully monitored by working closely and often with the office at Tuskegee University designed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe summer program for college sophomores, CReATE (Chemistry and Research for the Advancement of Tuskegee-Educated Scientists), will involve, each.-summer, 20 science majors from the various SMET disciplines in a research-oriented approach to the teaching of General Chemistry and the opportunity to be involved in research on the Tuskegee campus.\r\n\r\nThe Math Lab will be designed to assist students in the basic college math courses as well as the three semesters of calculus offered at Tuskegee University. The Math Lab will be networked throughout campus and will maintain an interactive WEB site.\r\n\r\nThe 300-level biochemistry course will link students to the more advanced courses, while building on the chemistry and math backgrounds of the students.\r\n\r\nThe partnerships, academic and industrial, are essential to the development of the students and faculty. Additionally, the strong connections existing between Tuskegee University and the Alabama Alliance for Minority Participation (AAMP) will be integral to this effort. The NSF/CREST grant on the Tuskegee campus, which supports an initiative to assist in the development of the Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering, provides a setting for the involvement of CReATE students in research, as does the NSF supported initiative in high performance computing at Tuskegee University. Other non-NSF programs provide similar opportunities. The infusion of motivated, qualified students to these programs will provide a synergistic enhancement of the students and the programs.\r\n",
