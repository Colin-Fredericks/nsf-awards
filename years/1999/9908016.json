The objective is to develop a unified interface constitutive model and a noncontact noninvasive optical laser measurement technique to study failure of the interface.  The particular assemblies that will be studied are the silicon-epoxy-kovar frame assembly and the silicon- solder- alumina assembly.  Thermal cycling and steady state vibration will be applied on the sample concurrently.  Interfacial delamination and microcracks as well as the interface shear and peeling strains will be measured.  The study will include experimental and numerical work with experimental/computational mechanics, laser-optics and microscopy components.  The mechanical testing will be done using a thermal chamber- shaker assembly for concurrent loading as well as a miniature material tester.  After a certain number of load cycles, the delamination (and microcrack) volume will be measured with innovative optical methods involving femtosecond laser spectroscopy and interferometry, and confocal microscopy.  This direct measurement of anisotropic damage and comparisons with the constitutive model will facilitate numerical simulation of interface behavior.  The constitutive model includes a new anisotropic damage criterion based on entropy from the second law of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.  Relevant material properties will be obtained using a Minimat 2000 miniature material tester, which has an attached a thermal chamber and a microscope.     \r\n \r\nAnother important contribution of this interdisciplinary project will be to educate future engineers and researchers in an interdisciplinary field, which no single department presently can do.  Also, as a result of this interdisciplinary project several courses jointly taught by Civil, Mechanical, and Electrical Engineering Departments will be initiated.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
