 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for the acquisition of a laser system for the study of two-photon photoactive materials and their 3D patterning by nonlinear excitation.  The system produces high-energy femtosecond laser pulses tunable from the ultraviolet to the near-IR spectral region.  Two-photon materials and processes form the basis of a new technology for rapid prototyping of 3D microstructures and for high density 3D optical data storage.  This laser will enable important studies of the processes involved in the nonlinear photochemistry in these materials and studies of the mode of nonlinear optical exposure, for example, single shot vs. repetitive excitation and femtosecond vs. picosecond pulse durations, which are important for optimizing the exposure processes.  These investigations will provide knowledge and know-how allowing the design of materials that are more efficient and permit higher recording resolution, and definition of the requirements for new rapid-prototyping instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed laser system will foster collaborative materials research activities on two-photon photoactive materials with researchers from several academic institutions, as well as private sector and government laboratories. It will also provide unique opportunities to advance the frontiers of materials research education through integration of concepts, knowledge and practical experience involving design of photosensitive materials, ultrafast lasers, nonlinear optical processes, and microfabrication.\r\n&&&\r\nThis is an ideal award, designed to significantly impact research and education in a very important field.\r\n\r\n",
