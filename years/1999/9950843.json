 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a user-friendly measurement and analysis laboratory with tremendous flexibility for faculty instruction and undergraduate student research projects at Marshall University, a predominantly undergraduate institution.  Increasingly important in the scientific community is detailed quantification of variation among and between structures and organisms.  With the development of new instrumentation and more powerful computers and software, the ability to go beyond mere qualitative descriptions of variation is possible.  These new morphometric techniques have been developed for graduate studies at a few institutions (e.g., Duke University and SUNY Stony Brook), however, the goal of this project is, for the first known time, to adapt the laboratory facilities and exercises from Duke and SUNY for undergraduate instruction.  Currently missing from our instructional efforts is the ability to measure and analyze scientific specimens in a rigorous manner.  We have been unable to incorporate detailed structural measurement and analyses into many of our laboratory exercises and independent study projects.  This project rectifies these situations by obtaining various measurement devices, permitting both 2- and 3- dimensional analyses of variable-sized specimens.  Two-dimensional measurement will be possible with digital calipers, digitizing tablets, binocular microscopes, or by images obtained from either video camera frame-grabbing or our recently purchased Scanning Electron and Confocal microscopes and imported into appropriate software systems.  Students will also be able to make three-dimensional measurements with either 3D digitizing tablets, or when more precision is needed, the laser digitizing system Surveyor 810 or VoxBlast imaging software.   Additionally, computer facilities permit image analysis, quantitative and statistical evaluation, graphic representation, and slide presentations to be conducted by the students.  Undergraduates encounter this technology in both introductory and advanced laboratory exercises.  Laboratory exercises are incorporated into five of the non-majors and majors introductory courses.  In addition, the lab is used in several upper-division courses, including a new course in scientific quantification and analysis.  This equipment is available to the ever-growing number of undergraduates involved in scientific research.  With the Capstone senior thesis requirements, student opportunities for independent research must be expanded, and the measurement/analysis laboratory provides invaluable tools for sophisticated problem-solving.",
