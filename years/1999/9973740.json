 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses synthesis, processing and structure/property relationships in polymer-silicate nanocomposites, a class of materials where nano-scale clay particles are molecularly dispersed within a polymer matrix. These nanocomposites are ideal for studying polymers in confined geometries and for investigating the influence of surface/polymer interactions on polymer dynamics. Issues such as elucidation of what drives the polymers to penetrate closely packed clay layers or what the dominate variables are for controlling morphology will be investigated. The approach is to determine how variables such as chain architecture and polarity affect miscibility. Block and random copolymers of styrene and 4-vinyl pyridine will be synthesized. Then nanocomposites produced with the copolymers, polystyrene and organically modified silicates will be prepared and characterized. Electron microscopy(TEM) and x-ray diffraction will be used to determine the composite morphology; DSC and solid state NMR will be used to study polymer chain dynamics. The results will be compared to predictions made by current theories. A primary goal is to establish guidelines for synthesizing polymer/inorganic hybrids and thus, facilitate the fabrication of cost-effective nanocomposites.\r\n %%% \r\nThis is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of special relevance to the properties and performance of polymer-based nanocomposite materials. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). \r\n***\r\n",
