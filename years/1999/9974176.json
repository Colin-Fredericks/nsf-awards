 "awd_abstract_narration": "Considerable progress has been made in understanding the public approval of the performance of the head of government (or, in some countries, the governing party).  In the United States and some other countries, \"popularity\" polls are conducted monthly, if not more often, yielding sufficient data for time-series analyses of the properties, causes, and consequences of public approval.  Yet a superb set of testing sites for understanding this aspect of executive politics, the 50 American states, is not being utilized, even though pollsters have been inquiring about gubernatorial performance sporadically since the 1950s and fairly regularly since the mid-1980s.\r\n\r\nGubernatorial approval has not been totally ignored in the research literature.  At this point, though, attempts to test models of gubernatorial popularity across a large cross-section of states are in their infancy, and much remains to be done.  Likewise, state election models could well be reformulated and retested by incorporating gubernatorial approval rates, and models could be tested that are currently inestimable.\r\n\r\nThe primary reason why data on gubernatorial approval has been underutilized is that no comprehensive file of these data has been available.  However, one of the PIs has made an excellent start by assembling gubernatorial approval ratings for all 50 states, more that 1500 ratings in all.  Funding, at present, will fill in gaps to determine whether additional poll results are available; if so, to access them; to create an integrated gubernatorial approval data file; and to hold a conference focused on gubernatorial approval research.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals, it is necessary to contact as many as 50 polling organizations.  It is also important to inquire about early polls, especially those from periods prior to the 1980s.  No less important is to establish a more or less automatic mechanism for obtaining future poll results.  Finally, the data collection currently exists on paper.  Support is provided to develop this into a system appropriate for electronic storage.\r\n\r\nThe data and conference will contribute to work in at least tow areas.  First, they will enhance understanding of executive approval and the relationship between approval and elections.  Second, they will contribute to the study of state politics, where some forms of research, such as on gubernatorial approval, have been limited to the study of one or a small number of states.  Finally, it is relevant to note that the data to be archived are unlikely to be maintained indefinitely in the absence of an effort such as that proposed; if not collected now, the data would be irretrievably lost.\r\n",
