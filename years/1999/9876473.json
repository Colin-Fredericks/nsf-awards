This project is a cooperative effort between the University of Michigan and the Danish Meteorological Institute. The project is a continuation of a collaboration, which began, with the installation of an array of magnetometer stations on the Greenland ice cap in 1991. The autonomous magnetometer systems in central Greenland provided valuable intermediate variometer measurements of magnetic perturbations between the Greenland west and east coast stations. The original 4-station MAGIC array was closed and removed during the 1996 and 1997 field seasons. The decision to close the stations was based upon the accumulation of snow (approximately 1 meter/year), the lifetime of the electrical power systems which rely on gel-cell batteries for winter operations, and the planned closure of the Omega navigation system which was used to obtain an accurate time base. The present MAGIC II array was deployed during the 1997 field season to continue these critical measurements using improved equipment, and a reduced number of stations. One station was placed at the central Greenland GISP drilling site to provide continuity between the west and east coast stations, and one station was placed at the Air National Guard LC130 Raven skiway (the Polar Ice Training Site - PITS) to provide a dense two-dimensional array for detailed current calculations. The MAGIC data in combination with data from the Greenland coastal stations and Sondrstrom incoherent scatter radar has been crucial in resolving the spatial and evolutionary characteristics of various dynamic ionospheric current systems, including traveling convection vortices, poleward propagating DPY currents, and the transition of large scale convection systems from one state to another. Using data from the MAGIC II stations in combination with other Greenland, Canadian, Scandinavian, and Antarctic magnetic data, and coordinated with other ancillary ground based and satellite data, this project will investigate high latitude magnetic pulsations and interhemispheric auroral oval and polar cap relationships. The focus of this project is on understanding the various electrodynamic current systems, which couple energy and momentum from the solar wind to the magnetosphere and ionosphere\r\n",
