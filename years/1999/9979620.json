 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involving the North Carolina State University and Duke University Colleges of Engineering, the Research Triangle Science and Math Partnership and Wake County Schools focuses on teaching physics, engineering and math to diverse populations including students from underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET), hearing-impaired students, and students for whom English is a second language.  The underlying theme for the entire program provides encouragement to students from groups that are underrepresented in SMET through the use of role models and particular teaching techniques.  This theme is emphasized in both the recruitment of GK-12 Fellows and the teaching of students.  A high percentage of women and individuals from underrepresented groups comprise the role model teams.   Activities and modules developed for use by the teams include: 1) \"Hands-on Engineering\",  2) exploring engineering in group settings, and 3) basic electricity and communication.  Benefits to the K-12 schools include curriculum that integrates science, technology, and engineering topics with math, reading, and writing.  Benefits to the Fellows include improved communication skills and self-image.",
