 "awd_abstract_narration": "The early explorers of Antarctica's heroic era erected buildings and brought large amounts of supplies to survive the extreme environment during their Antarctic exploration.  Huts built by Robert F. Scott during the Discovery expedition (1901-1904), Ernest Shackleton and the Nimrod expedition (1908), Scott's Terra Nova expedition (1911) and others were abandoned once the expedition was over, leaving the buildings and thousands of artifacts behind.  Today these historic sites provide a remarkable view into the past.  Furniture, scientific apparatus, food stores, and other items are left in the huts as a reminder of what everyday life was like for the early explorers.  The extreme polar environment has protected many of the artifacts from rapid decay but over the past 8 to 9 decades, deterioration has become increasingly more prevalent.  This joint US-New Zealand project will examine issues related to preservation of historic huts in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica. The US scientific effort will identify the cause of the deterioration present in the wooden structures, determine the current condition of the wood and obtain a better understanding of the unique biological and non-biological degradation processes responsible for the deterioration.  An assessment of the wood destroying microorganisms present will be made and their mode of action during the short summer months of activity determined.  Micromorphological investigations using scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray microanalyses and chemical analyses will be used to study the different types of deterioration found.  The results from these investigations will provide needed information that is crucial to develop successful conservation plans for the long-term preservation of the buildings, wooden materials and other historic artifacts left by the early explorers of Antarctica.",
