 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the physics of fundamental interactions that lie beyond the currently understood regime of energies.  Investigations of these new interactions will use the theoretical structures of unification based on supersymmetry and superstring theories.  Supersymmetry and superstrings provide a framework which could lead to the full unification of all forces, including gravity. \r\n\tThe research to be carried out in this project will focus on signatures of unification in supercollider experiments and in dark matter searches.  Other aspects of the investigations will focus on more theoretical aspects of model building.  Studies will also be conducted to see if the unification of forces can occur in the realm of energies that can be reached in the next generation of accelerators. These investigations are of significance since the nature of physics at energies that will be achievable in the near future at supercolliders can unravel new dimensions of space time that appear in a class of string theories with a low unification scale.  Research to be carried out will identify the effects of these extra dimensions in precision measurements that will be made at the Tevatron at Fermilab and at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland.\r\n",
