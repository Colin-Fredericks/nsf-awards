The goals of the project are two-fold:  1) to plan an innovative interactive exhibit presenting current research and pressing environmental issues to a diverse audience, and  2) to serve as a model for other university museums in bringing together researchers, exhibit specialists, undergraduate and graduate students, K-12 teachers, and visitors to plan an exhibit.\r\n\r\nThe planning phase will involve researching other exhibit projects on biodiversity that have successfully communicated with underserved audiences; traveling to other science museums to learn about exhibits on biodiversity; bringing a specialist to Boulder to meet with the exhibit team; assessing the baseline knowledge of the core concepts; meeting with prospective visitors, university scientists, and representatives from collaborative organizations; and drafting a conceptual plan for the exhibit.",
