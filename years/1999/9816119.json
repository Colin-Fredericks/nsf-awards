 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clouds are the main atmospheric constituent responsible for reflecting sunlight back to space, and thus are a crucial component in determining the climate of Earth.  Changes in cloudiness or cloud composition can be as important an element in climate change as the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  For example, a cloud consisting of many tiny droplets is more reflective than a cloud having the same water content but with fewer and larger droplets.  The droplets form on water-soluble aerosol particles called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).  Different air masses have widely different populations of aerosols, depending on the surface type, the wind speed near the ground, and the proximity to natural or anthropogenic sources of particulate matter.  An important link in the connection between aerosols and climate is the condensation process by which cloud droplets form and grow.  The purpose of this project is to improve our understanding of the relationship between the aerosol populations in different types of air masses and the concentration of droplets that form on them.  The approach makes use of data collected by aircraft during the Second Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-2), an international field program conducted north of the Island of Tenerife in the summer of 1997.  Measurements of CCN in the air below cloud base will be compared with droplet concentrations measured in the clouds to determine the extent to which the concentration can be predicted on the basis of known aerosol characteristics.  Airborne measurements of CCN are not standardized, and an important part of the analysis will be a comparison of CCN measured by several different instruments to specify the experimental uncertainty of the observations.  Results of the analysis will be applied to the questions of aerosol effects on cloud reflectivity and precipitation development through collaboration with specialists in radiative transfer and numerical modeling.  The study will provide a more solid foundation than we now have for understanding the complex relationships between aerosols, clouds, and climate.",
