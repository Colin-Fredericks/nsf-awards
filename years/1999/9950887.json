 "awd_abstract_narration": "Delaware's chemical industries are critical to the state's economic viability, and have played a key role in the design of Delaware Tech's new Chemical Process Operator Technology curriculum. This Associate Degree program includes broad preparation in chemistry, physics and mathematics and a range of courses with direct applicability to the operation of several different types of chemical plants. The Chemistry Department is developing this program in cooperation with faculty in other A.A.S. programs, including mechanical engineer technology, industrial plant maintenance technology and process instrumentation technology. \r\n\r\nThis project enables the College to implement its new Chemical Process Operator Technology curriculum. The curriculum is adapted from the American Chemical Society's National Voluntary Standards for Chemical Process technical  workers.  The adaptation involves consideration of local industry needs.  The project also helps to equip four state-of-the-art laboratories for integrated use in Chemical Process Operator Technology, Mechanical Engineering Technology, Industrial Plant Maintenance Technology and Process Instrumentation Technology.  Project goals are to implement an A.A.S. Degree program in Chemical Process Operator Technology, to enhance related A.A.S. Degree courses and to work with an Industry Advisory Committee of chemical industries to ensure that associate degree curricula and the new laboratories meet industry, American Chemical Society, and TAC-ABET standards.",
