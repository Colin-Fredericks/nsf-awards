 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of what engineers do improves the quality of life, but descriptions of engineering programs generally fail to show a human side that would be of interest to women.  The purpose of the proposed project is to plan a 3-year program to (1) prepare materials and develop programs for recruiting women into engineering programs by emphasizing the human side of engineering, (2) implement the recruiting programs, (3) develop student-centered collaborative projects that focus on the human side of engineering and hopefully encourage women to stay involved in the engineering curriculum, and (4) organize and conduct the inaugural multi-institution collaboration.\r\n   Planning for this program will involve 4-year engineering and technology schools as well as selected high schools throughout Ohio.  Groups of women students prepared for engineering school, and ranging from high school juniors to college sophomores will be interviewed to identify themes, media, and messengers that would be most useful in recruiting women engineering students.  University faculty and industry representatives willing to help define and support collaborative projects for engineering students will be identified.\r\n",
