 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, a linear function of a symmetric matrix variable X is minimized subject to linear equality constraints on X and the essential constraint that X be positive semidefinite.  Several problems can be cast as SCP problems including linear programs, convex quadratic problems with convex quadratic inequality constraints, matrix norm minimization and a variety of maximum and minimum eigenvalue problems.  In addition, SDP has many applications in engineering, combinatorial optimization and statistics.\r\n\r\nToday, it is known that several interior-point algorithms for linear programs can be extended to SDP problems.  As in linear programming, many of these methods are polynomially convergent and perform very efficiently in practice.  In particular, the class of primal-dual interior-point methods and their higher-order variants are very effective methods for solving SDP problems.  In contrast to linear programming, there are many ways one can compute the Newton search directions used in primal-dual algorithms for SDP.  For this reason, the theory of primal-dual methods for SDP is substantially more difficult than that for LP.  \r\n\r\nThis project addresses the development of the theory and implementation of algorithms for SDP problems.  The objectives of this research consist of: 1) advancing the knowledge of the theory of polynomial and superlinear convergence analysis of primal-dual methods for SDP; 2) studying the existence and asymptotic behavior of continuous trajectories for SDP; \r\n3) developing superlinearly convergent higher-order primal-dual methods for SDP problems which do not have strictly complementary solutions; 4) developing interior-point primal-dual algorithms to solve more general classes of cone programming problems; 5) developing new methods for solving specially structured SDP problems based on nonlinear programming techniques; 6) implementing these new approaches and comparing them against existing SDP methods; 7) extending primal-dual interior point algorithms to the context of nonlinear SDP  and complementary problems.\r\n\r\nThis research will lead to new or improved algorithms to find exact or approximate solutions to large-scale optimization problems arising in diverse applications in industry, finance, science, and engineering.\r\n",
