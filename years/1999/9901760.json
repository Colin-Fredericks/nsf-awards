 "awd_abstract_narration": "9901760\r\nHwang\r\n\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is directed toward innovative manufacturing technology to deposit durable, scratch resistant, optical coatings on polycarbonate plastic substrates in large volume and at a low production cost. The basis of this innovation is a patented and proprietary Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) process for thin film coatings. CCVD is an open atmosphere flame-based process, which can easily be scaled to coat large surfaces and complex shapes without the need for a vacuum chamber or reaction vessel. The environmentally safe CCVD process can be adapted for continuous production line deposition, enabling economies of scale in high volume manufacturing. The proposer plans to build on a Phase I effort in developing scratch-resistant, durable, high quality optical coatings on polycarbonate, which are intended for automotive and architectural applications. The proposer is aligned in this SBIR project with a Fortune 100-size manufacturer of polycarbonate plastic and has also recruited a leading U.S manufacturer of coating and adhesive precursor chemicals to participate in Phase II. Both of these industrial companies have committed to provide in-kind cost share to the Phase II effort. Each will partner with the proposer in Phase III commercialization of successful technical results.\r\n     Scratch resistant optical coatings on polycarbonate will enable new products to replace glass in automotive and architectural applications. These products will enable lighter weight vehicles, shatter proof windows and improved thermal and optical performance.\r\n",
