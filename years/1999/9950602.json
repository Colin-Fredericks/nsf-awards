 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many lab activities in introductory and advanced astronomy courses still rely on the use of photographic prints- a technology no longer used in the profession. The drop in the price of computers and the advance of high-quality, user-friendly image processing software has made possible the integration of modem methodology into the curriculum. Also, an accumulation of digital images originally obtained for research purposes offers an opportunity for students to do lab activities and even research on archival data. Finally, modem visual and CCD spectroscopic equipment provides the opportunity for students to participate in this extremely important area.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to integrate modem image processing techniques and spectroscopy into the astronomy curriculum, from the introductory level through the program for majors. Introductory lab exercises traditionally done with photography will be replaced with ones that use modem digital images, spectra and computer processing techniques. For advanced astronomy students, a larger format CCD camera will allow high quality photometric and spectroscopic data to be obtained. Faster computers and Internet access will allow students to use modem resources to prepare for their observations.\r\n\r\nSpecific activities will include the measurement of variable star brightness in a globular cluster to determine the distance to the cluster, determination of brightness and colors of stars in open clusters to study stellar evolution, measurement of proper motions of stars, and calculation of the age of the Crab Nebula. Other activities will examine images from the Hubbell Space Telescope to study properties of the early universe. In addition, teams of students, to discover any variable stars in those fields will study archival images of star fields. Astronomy majors will use the CCD camera and spectrograph to obtain images and spectra of a variety of astronomically interesting objects. These images will be analyzed with image processing techniques to provide quantitative results.\r\n\r\n",
