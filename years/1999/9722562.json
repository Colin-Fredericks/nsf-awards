 "awd_abstract_narration": "***\r\n9722562\r\nReucroft\r\nThe Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one of two US supported  experiments to be built at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The primary physics goal of CMS is to discover the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking. To that end, the basic philosophy of CMS is to enclose the tracking and calorimetry\r\ninside a strong Solenoidal magnet. This design allows for a Compact design allowing optimal Muon detection without compromise to the electromagnetic calorimetry because of inert material. In general CMS is optimized for detection of electrons, photons, muons, neutrinos and jets.  The Standard Model predicts the existence of the Higgs Particle, the missing component of the model.   Reconstruction of the Higgs decay modes predicted by theStandard Model requires excellent lepton detection. At the highluminosities to be used at the LHC, the lepton of choice is the muon due to its relatively clean signature.  There are about 1500 physicists in the CMS Collaboration who plan to build the detector. The detector is to be constructed from 1998 until data taking in mid 2005. The composition of CMS is roughly 50% physicists from member states, 25% from Russia and other non member states, and 25% US groups.  During 1994 a US CMS Collaboration of about 320 physicists and engineers from 40 institutions (4 national labs) was formed. The collective goal of this group is to pursue high energy physics at the highest energy frontier which will be available at LHC.\r\nTheir  experience on previous hadron collider experiments at Fermilab and CERN and on the R&D associated with the SSC makes it possible for US physicists to have a major impact on the design of CMS. They have been assigned distinct and coherent managerial and construction responsibilities. including the management  for the hadron calorimetry (HCAL), the endcap muon system (EMU), the trigger system (TRIG), construction responsibilities in electron calorimetry (ECAL), tracking, data acquisition (DAQ) and computing and software.  The present design of the HCAL barrel and the EMU are the result of US CMS redesigning those parts of the detector.  CMS has appointed, in addition to detector coordinators, an education coordinator who, with a CMS  education task  group, intends to develop a sustained  program integrating research and education.\r\n***\r\n\r\n.",
