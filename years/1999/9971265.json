Recent development of the dynamic scaling hypothesis coupled with simulations and continuum theory point to an exciting and new direction in the area of non-equilibrium physics research. A number of experimental systems will be used to explore quantitatively the roughening phenomena at far-from-equilibrium and are designed to test the dynamic scaling hypothesis. The systems include etching of surfaces (plasma etching, ion sputtering, and reactive ion etching) and growth of films (including polymers) on surfaces. State-of-the-art techniques will be used to span a wide length scale both in the vertical (interface width) and horizontal (lateral correlation) directions to measure the interface roughness in real-time. The roughness and morphology will be simulated using noise-induced and other growth mechanisms including sidewall growth and anisotropy growth. The roughness exponent and interface growth exponent measured from experiments and simulations will be used to establish the universality class of dynamic scaling phenomenon. It is anticipated that a fundamental understanding of the growth/etch front roughening phenomena coupled with characterization techniques to monitor the surface in real-time will allow the control of interface roughness in practical applications.\r\n%%%\r\nInterface roughness is one of the central issues in thin film and device processing and it directly controls many physical and chemical properties of films and devices. This research investigates fundamental aspects of the formation of interface roughness during growth/etching of surfaces under far-from-equilibrium conditions. In the etching area, semiconductor-processing techniques such as plasma etching, ion sputtering, and reactive ion etching will be used. A new effort in the growth area will be initiated to study the morphology and evolution of polymer film growth by vapor deposition. Students will utilize atomic force microscopy, light scattering, x-ray diffraction and electron diffraction to measure and quantify the interface roughness. The time dependent roughness data will be analyzed using dynamical scaling theories with fractal dimensions. Students trained under this research program will have a smooth transition to either an academic or an industrial environment.\r\n***\r\n",
