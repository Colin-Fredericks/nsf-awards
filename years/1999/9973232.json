Birman\r\n\r\nWe propose to investigate several problems relating to knots and to3-manifolds:  (1) We hope to find new invariants of Legendrian and transverse knots in 3-space, using the standard contact structure.  Every transverse knot can be represented as a closed braid, and we begin by seeking an appropriate modification of the classical Markov theorem for transverse knots.  We hope to extend the work of Eliashberg and Fraser, which shows that transverse knots are determined by their knot type and Bennequin number, to a wider class of knots. After that we hope to study knots for which we conjecture that their theorem fails.  We have candidates.   (2) We propose to study the complexity of the problem of recognizing the unknot algorithmically. We conjecture the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm. (3) We propose to study invariants of Heegaard splittings of closed, orientable 3-manifolds which arise through representations of the mapping class group of a surface onto various(initially  finite) groups.  One such collection of groups arises through the work of Wright and the related work of Masbaum on the Reshitikhan-Turaev representations of the mapping class group.   \r\n\r\nThe planet earth is an example of a 2-dimensional manifold.   If you stand at any 2 points on the earth (which, to a mathematician, is to be thought of as having no geographical features and being perfectly round and smooth), then your surroundings look identical at the 2 points, and give you no hint of the global topology.  A major leap in thinking about the earth occurred when it was learned that in fact the earth is round, i.e. it is a 2-dimensional manifold, in particular it is a 2-sphere.  But if we add one more dimension, we are in the position of people before Columbus made his discovery:  A `neighborhood of one point looks just like a neighborhood of another, and we have no idea of the global picture.  All we know is that the world is a 3-dimensional manifold.  It could be a3-dimensional sphere, but there are many other possibilities too, and the existence of black holes suggests a very complicated structure.  The work is this proposal studies the most accessible examples of 3-dimensionalmanifolds, namely the space which remains when one removes a knotted circle from a 3-dimensional sphere.  Knots are incredibly complicated objects, and understanding them is very basic to 3-manifold geometry and topology.  By finding ways to recognize individual knots algorithmically, and by finding partial ways to tell them apart, mathematicians gain insight into deep questions about topology.  We will also study other3-dimensional manifolds by cutting them apart into two handlebodies which are pasted together along a so-called Heegaard surface.\r\n",
