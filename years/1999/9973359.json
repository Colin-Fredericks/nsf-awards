Almost ten years in administrative positions, beginning immediately after she received tenure, have taken their toll on research productivity.  Collaborations with Holly Stein and John Morgan on applications of Re-Os systematics to problems in igneous petrology and ore genesis have been her principal source of support and continuity.  Over the next two years, her service and administrative commitments will decline.  This proposed research would help her take advantage of an excellent convergence of resources - laboratory facilities, scientific expertise, and field collaborators - to initiate a promising new line of research.  Furthermore, the project will let her use her experience in high-temperature radiogenic isotope systematics and knowledge of geochemistry to open new arenas in geochronology and element transport in sedimentary environments.\r\n",
