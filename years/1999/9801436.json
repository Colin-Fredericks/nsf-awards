 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801436\r\nQi\r\n    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop an Intelligent Prevention and Information System for Earthquake-Induced Urban Fires (IPIS-EF).  Earthquake hazards are serious threats and have caused heavy damages and casualties.  In addition to the ground shaking, fires that follow an. earthquake are usually the major cause of human casualties and property losses.  Therefore, the research and development of advanced technological countermeasures against earthquake-induced fires in urban regions is an essential aspect of effective earthquake hazard mitigation.  The system to be developed consists of three principal subsystems:  (1) Automatic Shut-Off Subsystem (Auto-Shutoff) for gas lines and furnaces to prevent ignition of fires following earthquakes, (2) Advanced Tele-Communication Subsystem. (Tele-Communication) for prompt and accurate report of fires, and (3) Intelligent Expert Subsystem for Signal Process (Intel-Signal Process).  The technical, operational and economical feasibility of the IPIS-EF system and its three subsystems has been satisfactorily demonstrated in the Phase I study.  A triggering value determination model, satellite communication and a Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC) network-based intelligent system are employed for the IPIS-EF system.  Further evaluation, laboratory and field testing of the assembled prototype system will be conducted in the Phase II research.  The end product,\r\ni. e., complete IPIS-EF prototype would be a cost-effective, robust and commercializable system for both fire prevention as well as prompt and accurate report of the fires.    The potential commercial applications of IPIS-EF are quite broad. The users of the system include public agencies and private organizations responsible for safety at all levels of government, such as FEMA, urban fire departments, fire stations, and heavy equipment factories and plants.  Successful development of IPIS-EF for earthquake-induced fires including its h ardware can also be used for conventional fire prevention and extinguishment. The successful commercialization of IPIS-EF would not only enhance the competitiveness of U.S. businesses but also would contribute to protection of public lives and properties.",
