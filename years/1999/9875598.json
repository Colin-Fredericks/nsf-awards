In collaboration with one of the pioneering flow cytometry groups the proposal writer will develop the statistical methods necessary to transform this technique from a manually operated apparatus to an internet-accessible digital library.  The research will exploit some surprising properties of log-concave densities to solve various statistical and computational problems in mixture analysis and visualization.  The investigator will also organize summer conferences for junior faculty members to learn the tools necessary to effectively teach freshman seminars, which are gaining a firm foothold in many universities.\r\n\r\nFlow cytometry has become a widely used tool to analyze cells.  Until the mid 1980's, the technique was used almost exclusively in the research community.  Recently, it has become a prevalent instrument in the clinical setting: it is the primary method for staging HIV disease, and it is commonly used to detect leukemia and lymphomas. Virtually every modern hospital now has flow cytometer.  The analysis of the resulting data poses considerable statistical challenges, which so far have prevented an effective digital use of the results. The investigator will address these issues with novel statistical techniques. Further, the grant will support summer conferences organized by the investigator to disseminate the tools necessary to effectively teach freshman seminars. These seminars are designed to involve undergraduates in interactive learning and research at an early stage, and are getting increasingly popular at many universities.\r\n",
