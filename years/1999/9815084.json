This workshop will be held currently with the 9th International Symposium on Robotics Research ((ISRR), October 9-12, 1999. The overall mandate is to re-examine how to best align the efforts of the robotics research community with the needs of a discipline to achieve its long promised but still delayed social impact. This mandate fits well within the theme of the 9th ISRR, designed to help focus and articulate the next decades' intellectual agenda in the field of robotics. At the close of the 20th century, it seems well worth such an exercise in the ensemble of a broad coalition of general stakeholders in the future of the field. These include corporate managers, academic researchers, government representatives, and perhaps even some observers such as science/technology reporters. A list of topics to be discussed includes 1) markets,  2) materials (of robots) , 3) modeling (of environments), 4) algorithms, 5) human augmentation, and 6) zoomorphism.  Findings of the workshop, including position papers and critical reactions they received at the overview forums, will comprise the substance of a public report  to the NSF and a website turned over to the NSF for appropriate wider dissemination.  \r\n",
