The video will be premiered at SIGGRAPH '99 in August 1999 held in Los Angeles. The video will be produced in High Definition broadcast format allowing distribution in multiple formats such as NTSC and PAL.  The project has two volunteer Executive Producers: John Hart, responsible for SIGGRAPH coordination, and Carl Machover, responsible for content.  A distinguished content advisory committee consisting of Gwen Bell, Nelson Max, Chase Chasen, Dick Phillips, Alan Chesnais, Patric Prince, Nick England and Alvy Ray Smith helped map out content.  The treatment includes interviews with pioneers in the field. Footage of early accomplishments will be part of the video.  The video is expected to communicate to a wide audience the accomplishments of computer graphics ranging from interactive graphics systems and text formatting to movie art such as StarTrek.  The video will be distributed to educational circles and is expected to encourage young people to try science and technology career paths.\r\n\r\n",
