This persistence is striking because males have only a single copy of the color-determining gene and theory suggests that this type of variation should not readily persist in nature.  This study will address: (1) how water temperature may affect the expression of body color so as to mask the gene that causes melanism and make silver males appear more common than they really are; (2) how silver and melanic males interact with each other and with females; and (3) whether silver and melanic males differ in the number of offspring they sire when they compete for females, using behavioral observations and controlled genetic crosses.\r\n \r\nThe study addresses a fundamental gap between theory and empirical pattern.  In theory, single-copy genes, or haploids, ought not to exhibit much genetic variation in nature; in practice, variations like this one are common.  It also addresses a novel feature of natural genetic variation, that of temperature-dependent expression and whether that expression is actually masking more genetic variation than is apparent.  The way in which genetic variation is expressed in different thermal environments is a key issue in understanding how animals will respond to global change and whether that response will be merely ecological or also evolutionary. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH:\\popbio\\abstracts\\fy1999\\9902312 (Travis abstract)\r\n\r\n",
