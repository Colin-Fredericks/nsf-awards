 "awd_abstract_narration": "L   This conference on neurobiology of the fruitfly, Drosophila, brings together junior and senior workers in the field to discuss the latest advances in the neurosciences which are being made in this highly successful model system. Drosophila has been a classical model system for genetic studies because of its fast reproduction cycle, easy handling and breeding, and ease of inducing heritable mutations.  It now also serves as a model system for developmental neuroscience and for aspects of sensory and behavioral neuroscience. This is the only meeting in the U.S. concentrating on Drosophila neurobiology, and has been roughly biennial since 1986.  This year it focuses on the advances made as the combined power of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology and behavioral analysis are brought to bear on fundamental problems in neurobiology.  Topics covered range from development to circadian rhythms, and this year include expanded discussion of synaptic plasticity, adult central nervous system function, and complex behaviors.  The meeting is small enough to avoid concurrent sessions, and poster sessions provide additional time for discussion. Results presented at the meeting will be disseminated by an abstract volume that has a wide readership beyond the Drosophila community, into all areas of neuroscience.\r\n   The impact on neuroscience will come from the close interactions across different approaches presented at this conference, and from attendance by young investigators and those from underrepresented groups, to have an impact on their careers.\r\n\r\n",
