Specific issues addressed are the dynamics of the formation of photoinduced defect states, the time evolution of the electronic excitations, and the transport properties of the excitations. Femtosecond optical techniques, including ultrafast transient absorption, impulsive vibrational excitation, and photon echo measurements will be employed. Strong emphasis is given to the improvement of the undergraduate curriculum in optical physics by developing state of the art laboratory activities.  The PI will also develop and implement plans for improving the retention and professional success of women students in science and engineering.\r\n%%%\r\nIn this project supported by a CAREER award the PI will study the interactions between electrons and the lattice of solid metal-organic compounds by using several ultra-fast optical techniques.  The research will engage graduate and undergraduate students and prepare them for careers in areas of advanced science and technology for the 21st Century.  Strong emphasis will be given to the improvement of  the undergraduate curriculum in optical physics, an area which is now, and for many years to come of great importance to basic science and technology.  Plans will be developed and implemented for improving the retention and professional success of women students in science and engineering.  \r\n***\r\n",
