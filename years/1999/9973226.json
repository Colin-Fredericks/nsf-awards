 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project explores information-theoretic ideas for solving model\r\nselection problems in Mathematical Finance.  Typically, these problems\r\nconsist in the specification of a diffusion measure, or more generally, a\r\nmeasure on path-space, which describes the future states of the market.\r\nThe data used in the inversion consists of expected values of functionals,\r\nwhich correspond to observed prices of \"benchmark\" securities.  This\r\nproblem is studied from the point of view of partial differential\r\nequations and Monte-Carlo simulation.  We focus on model selection\r\ncriteria based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler entropy distance between\r\nthe unknown probability and a Bayesian prior.  In the special case of\r\ndiffusion processes, this leads to a constrained stochastic control\r\nproblem that can be solved via Lagrange multipliers.  In the case of Monte\r\nCarlo simulation, one must construct appropriate weighted measures, in a\r\ntechnique which is reminiscent of \"importance sampling.\"  These problems\r\nand their generalizations to non-linear constraints will be studied in a\r\nunified way using methods of Applied Mathematics and Numerical Analysis.\r\nThe goal is to achieve a better understanding of the question of model\r\nselection in Financial Economics, which is crucial for the management of\r\nfinancial risk by quantitative methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Description\r\n\r\nThis research proposal deals with the pricing and hedging of complex\r\nfinancial instruments called derivative securities. The technology derived\r\nhere, which is based on the mathematical fields of probability, statistics\r\nand numerical analysis, is used to develop accurate tools for pricing and\r\nmanaging complex financial instruments.  The motivation for this research\r\ncomes from the fact that quantitative finance offers many challenging\r\nmathematical and computer-related problems. This is a consequence of the\r\nso-called \"globalization'' phenomenon that links different financial\r\nmarkets and economies throughout the world.  The current proposal deals\r\nwith new mathematical methods for fine-tuning these models. Our aim is to\r\nbetter understand how they work and how they represent financial risk. By\r\nbringing to bear robust statistical methods and powerful mathematical\r\ntechniques, we expect to shed light on pricing and risk-management systems\r\nand to develop better models that can be shared with the financial\r\nindustry.  This is an important application of Mathematics to a new area\r\nof research: quantitative finance. The proposal is part of a greater\r\neffort at New York University's Courant Institute in the field of finance\r\nand markets. So far, we have been successful in training young scientists\r\nthat enter the business arena with a unique set of professional skills.\r\nThis suggests that such research is both directly and indirectly suitable\r\nin terms of the larger picture of the national economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
