 "awd_abstract_narration": "9900672\r\nTeukolsky\r\nA diversified program of research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics will be carried out at Cornell.  A large component of the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by supercomputer simulations.  One focus is to track the coalescence and merger of binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by such processes.  Another focus is to do the same thing for binary neutron star systems.  Codes for treating neutron stars and black holes in full general relativity share many common features, and it makes sense to develop them in parallel.  There are still significant theoretical and algorithmic issues to be solved before a stable code can be developed, and these problems will be tackled.  in addition, the stability of rotating neutron stars and the fate of unstable spinning stars will also be investigated.  A key motivation for this research is that mergers of binary black hole and neutron star systems are primary targets for gravitational wave detectors currently under construction, such as LIGO, and there is an urgent need for reliable waveforms.  Understanding binary neutron star systems may also be crucial to resolving a number of astrophysical puzzles, such as the origin of gamma-ray bursts and planets around pulsars.  Understanding the stability of rotating neutron stars is crucial to determining the maximum mass and rotation rate of neutron stars, as well as the outcomes of spin-up by accretion and binary merger.\r\n",
