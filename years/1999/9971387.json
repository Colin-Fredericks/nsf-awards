Gieseker and Huazhang Luo\r\n\r\nIn Geometric Invariant Theory, in order to study the moduli\r\nproblems, the notion of stability for any polarized projective\r\nvariety is introduced. However to check the stability is usually\r\na difficult problem.  It has been done by Mumford for curves with\r\ngenus bigger than 1, by Gieseker for surfaces of general type,\r\nand by Viehweg for high dimensional varieties with semi-ample\r\ncanonical line bundles. We will study the stability of a\r\npolarized smooth projective variety as used by Gieseker and\r\nMumford from a differential geometric viewpoint. More\r\nspecifically, we try to relate the Gieseker-Mumford stability to\r\nthe existence of a special Kahler metric on the variety such that\r\nits scalar curvature is constant and its Ricci curvature\r\nsatisfies some non-degenerate constraints. This metric is not\r\nKahler-Einstein, but is closely related to Kahler-Einstein\r\nmetric. One motivation for this project comes from the previous\r\nwork done by Donaldson, Uhlenbeck and Yau on the relation between\r\nstability of vector bundle and the existence of Yang-Mills\r\nconnection.\r\n \r\nOur project is to relate two important but different fields in\r\nmathematics together. One is the study of special metrics, which\r\ninvolves the study of differential equations on manifold and\r\nusually has connection to physics.  Another is the study of\r\nstability in moduli space theory which involves mainly\r\nalgebra. Our approach is to establish a correspondence between\r\nthese two fields, in particular to describe the meaning of\r\nstability in terms of the existence of special metrics. The\r\nadvantage for doing is it will not only provide us with new\r\ninsights about those special metrics, but also provide us with\r\nnew technique to moduli space theory. For example, this kind of\r\ncorrespondence will enable us to solve some difficult\r\nmathematical questions such as checking the Gieseker-Mumford\r\nstability of some manifolds. This question is one of the\r\nfundamental questions in the moduli space theory but has not been\r\nsolved in general.\r\n",
