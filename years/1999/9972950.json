Despite a growing amount of data in recent years on mechanical behavior, relatively little is understood concerning the deformation mechanisms in interfacial materials.  Furthermore, there is an increasing awareness that it is important to focus attention on microstructural features such as geometrical constraints, chemistry, and defects to due to processing in order to fully understand and control properties in these materials.  While interfaces are important in controlling the mechanical behavior of a large number of materials types, there are relatively few opportunities for interaction between, for example, materials scientists studying the properties of nanophase compacts, materials scientists investigating thin films or multilayered materials, and the solid mechanics community.  In addition, scientists and engineers from other disciplines including chemists, physicists, and geophysicists are heavily involved in the study of different kinds of interfacial materials. The objective of the conference is to provide a unique forum for discourse among scientists and engineers from varied backgrounds who share interests in identifying and understanding the effects of interfaces on mechanical behavior.   \r\n%%%\r\nThe United Engineering Foundation is sponsoring this international conference on \"Mechanical Properties of Interfacial Materials\", to be held June 27 - July 2, 1999 in 11 Ciocco, Italy.  An international organizing committee has been formed to coordinate the meeting, and in order to enhance the participation of overseas researchers, a European meeting location was selected.  The invited speakers include the top US and international researchers in this topical area.  The conference format will consist of morning and evening oral sessions and a poster session.  Attendance is estimated to be about 100 scientists from academia, national laboratories, and industry, with an estimated 10-15% of the participants being Ph.D. students.  The requested budget will be used to provide travel and registration fee support for young faculty and students.  Dissemination of the results of this meeting will be in the form of a group of papers published in Acta Materialia\r\n***\r\n",
