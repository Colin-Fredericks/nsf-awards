 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern data storage and data transmission systems can\r\nsimultaneously process data of various types, including text,\r\naudio, image, volumetric and video data. There is a need for\r\ndata compression in these systems, in order that efficient use\r\nmay be made of the limited amount of memory and bandwidth that\r\nis available, while meeting the consumer's demand for\r\nflexibility in data delivery services. In order to satisfy\r\nthis need, this research seeks to develop innovative algorithms for both lossless and lossy data compression. Compression algorithms are sought, which adapt themselves to general data structures, inferring and exploiting relationships in the data for compression purposes.\r\n\r\nThe research will focus upon a type of data compressor \r\ncalled a grammar based compressor. A grammar based compressor\r\nrepresents relationships in the data using a grammar, so that\r\nthe production rules of the grammar describe how the data  \r\nis to be exactly or approximately reconstructed. Data \r\ncompression is achieved by reducing this grammar or its\r\nassociated derivation tree to a more compact form, through the\r\nuse of reduction rules. The specific goals of the research are\r\nto obtain grammar based compressors which are capable of\r\nhandling general data structures (including data trees, 2-D and 3-D data, and other regular structures), which process data with linear time and space complexity, which provide good\r\nmaximal redundancy performance, and which are universal and\r\nperform well with respect to other universal compressors.\r\nGrammar based compressors with good theoretical properties \r\nshall be tested by means of computer experiments on real data,\r\nand comparisons shall be made with state of the art compression systems. Emphasis will be placed on finding robust grammar based compressors, which yield near state of the art \r\ncompression performance regardless of the type of data to\r\nwhich they are applied.\r\n\r\n",
