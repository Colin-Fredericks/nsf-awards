Since defects in the respiratory chain can result in lower energy production it is important to uncover the mechanism through which the various respiratory enzymes couple the oxidation of foodstuffs to cellular energy production. It has now been shown that cytochrome c reductase (CcR) and various terminal oxidases (cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) in mammals, and the bacterial quinol oxidases (QO)) convert redox free-energy into a membrane potential by coupling electron transfer to the translocation of protons across a membrane barrier. However, despite intensive research efforts, detailed mechanisms of energy transduction within these enzymes and how such mechanisms vary among the energy transducing proteins has not been elucidated. The overall goal of this project is to identify the magnitudes and time scales of volume changes and thermodynamics associated with two physiologically relevant processes in the energy transducing terminal oxidase of Eschericia coli (cytochrome bo or Cbo). Conformational changes associated with ligand binding to the active site, and electron transfer between various metal centers within the enzyme will be examined using variable temperature/pressure transient absorption spectroscopy and novel photothermal methods. Photothermal methods are proving to be powerful techniques for measuring volume changes and thermodynamics of photo-initiated reactions on a nanosecond to millisecond time-scale. Utilizing these techniques the magnitude and time scales of transient conformational changes required for energy transduction in terminal oxidases can be elucidated.\r\n\r\nBasic cellular respiration is a key process in all living organisms from fungi to mammals. In humans, respiration is a complex process in which foodstuffs are converted to carbon dioxide and oxygen is converted to water. This process results in the synthesis of energy storing molecules known as ATP (adenosine triphosphate). These energy storage molecules can then be used by cells to make proteins, replicate, move, etc.. In mammals this conversion takes place in small structures known as mitochondria that reside inside the cell. These mitochondria contain a series of four major enzymes (known as the respiratory chain) which couple the degradation of foodstuffs to the reduction of oxygen to water. It is clear that the failure of any part of the respiratory chain will have lethal consequences to the organism.  Improving our understanding of the mechanisms of cellular function on a molecular level is essential for enhancing our knowledge of cellular function.  In addition, studies of simpler bacterial enzymes may provide key information on the evolutionary aspects of respiration. This project focuses on understanding the terminal step in respiration (reduction of oxygen to water) using a bacterial enzyme that is related to but much simpler than the mammalian enzyme.  The PI will measure how the enzyme changes size/shape (changes in enzyme volume) with time while the enzyme performs its physiological function and how such changes are related to the overall function of the enzyme. This study represents one of the most significant steps towards understanding the fundamental events of basic cellular respiration. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
