Price \r\nMississippi State University \r\n\r\nCAREER:  Micromechanical model of undrained cyclic soil behavior   \r\n\r\nAbstract   \r\n\r\nThe objective of this study is to extend existing Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) technologies to explicitly account for pore fluid response in saturated soils.  DEM methodologies act through consideration of the forces acting on individual soil particles within the soil mass, and are particularly well suited to problems in which large particle deformations are expected to occur.  The rapid growth in recent years of computing power has popularized the use of DEM in calculating the behavior of granular soils.  However, it has proven difficult to explicitly account for the response of the continuum pore fluid in computing the response of the soil mass.   \r\n\r\nIn this study, a three-dimensional numerical, micromechanical model of fluid-saturated cohesionless soil will be developed. The soil-phase discrete element model will interface with a finite element representation of the fluid continuum.  The fluid model has been developed from the well-known equations of motion for two-phase porous media. The resulting model will enable extensive numerical testing of soil samples, including soils for which insufficient empirical data is available to calibrate continuum models. Because of the micromechanical nature of DEM, the data obtained will be of significantly higher resolution than is possible through laboratory or field studies. The numerical model thus developed will provide a powerful tool to augment the existing database of analytic and empirical soil response data.  Potential application areas include fines migration beneath pavement slabs, earthquake-induced liquefaction, and environmental transport phenomena.   \r\n\r\nStudent participation throughout the course of the study will be enacted at both the graduate and senior undergraduate level.  Students not directly involved in the study will benefit by means of a course module on DEM to be added to the curriculum of a graduate computational mechanics course. Meaningful partnering with the Pavements and Airfields Division of the Corps of Engineers Geotechnical Laboratory will ensure applicability of the study findings. Finally, dissemination of the study results to more distant researchers will be achieved through publishing of the study results, through both conventional  \r\n",
