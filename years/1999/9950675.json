 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Sciences at Eastern Illinois University offers\r\nundergraduate majors courses in Animal Physiology and Comparative Vertebrate Physiology and non-majors a course in Human Physiology (General Education course). For teachers obtaining the Masters Degree in Natural Sciences program, a summer course in Animal Physiology is also offered. The new PowerLab-based Physiology Laboratory provides a unique physiology teaching center shared by students in all physiology courses. The\r\nPowerLab is a powerful and affordable system designed for both classroom teaching and advanced research projects. It is an adequate tool to introduce to students principles, applications and instrumentation in modern, experimental physiology. The main goals of this laboratory are:\r\n\r\n1) involving students in interactive and investigative projects to develop critical thinking skills of making predictions and solving problems;\r\n\r\n2) teaching students modern physiology techniques and methods that will be used in their future workplace or graduate school;\r\n\r\n3 )evaluating, through experimental results, theories and facts taught in the\r\nlecture;\r\n\r\n4) providing resource for secondary school science teachers in the area.\r\n        \r\nThe Physiology Laboratory is also a valuable resource for Honors students completing Honors thesis in Biology, and undergraduate students pursuing independent research projects.\r\n",
