 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861395\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will use a novel synthesis route to develop monodispersed carbon nanotubes for high power energy storage applications.  High surface area carbons have been used as the electrode materials in recently developed electrochemical supercapacitors.  However, the energy densities achieved to date for electrochemical supercapacitors have fallen far short of the theoretically attained mark.  One major reason for this has been problems with utilization of the full capacity of the electrode materials, due to restriction of electrolyte solution accessible to much of the carbon surface.  It is also essential to reduce or eliminate particle to particle contact resistances among the carbon powders, which constitute the electrode for high performance charge discharge characteristics.  This program seeks to leap frog these technology barriers with an innovation that focuses on monodispersed carbon nanotubes as electrode materials for electrochemical supercapacitors.  During Phase I, Amsen will demonstrate the proof-of-concept of such a material.  Phase II will build on Phase I success, optimize, build prototypes and field test the technology in partnership with potential customers.  Phase III will commercialize the technology and anticipated spin off.\r\n     High power density, reliable electrochemical supercapacitors would find a large market in military applications where portable and miniaturized electronics and actuators are being used.  Other applications include hybrid power systems for electric vehicles, memory backup systems for computers and electronic instruments, pulsed power source for lasers and camera flash equipment, and power source for portable consumer products.\r\n\r\n",
