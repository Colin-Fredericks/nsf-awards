 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this POWRE research is the reconstruction of prehistoric subsistence and health in the tropical Americas.   Specifically, the research will investigate the effects of social hierarchy on diet and subsistence among individual members of two prehistoric groups, one at Cerro Juan Diaz in central Panama (c. CE 600-700) and the other at two sites in the Valle de Samaca, Colombia (c. CE 900-1200).  Both groups were ranked societies and had the potential for differential subsistence and health patterns within their societies.  Artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations have indicated that certain chiefly segments of those societies had exclusive access to rare and finely made objects.  Did those chiefs also control access to local subsistence resources?  If so, did the ruling elite have greater access to specific or nutritionally superior food resources?  The research will investigate these and several related questions about subsistence, community subgroup, and health.  Did males and females within these societies have differential access to food resources?  Did the elderly or children consume a diet that was different from that of active, middle-aged members of the community?  Did women of childbearing age consume a diet different from that of other community members?  How did age, gender roles, specialized social and domestic activities, and social-economic status of individual members of the community affect their health status?  Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in the human skeletal remains will be used to assess intra-population variation in human diet as it related to the age, sex, health status, and social rank of individuals in those populations.  Skeletal indicators of nutritional stress and infection will be used to assess individual and group health status as they related to the quality of the diet.  This project will contribute to our understanding of ancient, elite control of subsistence resources in the American tropics, as well as to our understanding of how those resources were distributed among the general populace.  It is well understood that an individual's biological sex, which can be determined from examination of skeletal remains, is distinct from gender, which is usually considered a social construct most often, but not always, correlated with biological sex.  Thus, by examining both cultural and biological aspects of individuals identified by age and biological sex, we can better understand the more elusive characteristics of past societies and the roles of those individuals in their societies.  This POWRE grant, in addition to the specific research involved, should advance the PI's prominence as a research scientist, mentor and scholar in this area of research.",
