Marine scientists work from ships all over the globe to study the seafloor using towed systems, remotely operated or autonomous vehicles, and submersibles, such as Alvin.  Every day they make new discoveries as they study and learn about the ocean floor environment-the volcanoes that erupt beneath the ocean, the spectacular hot springs that are driven by heat from the interior of the Earth, and the exotic communities of organisms that form oases of life around the hot springs.  The advent of real-time, web-based communications now provides an unparalleled opportunity for students and the general public to share and participate in the exploration of the deep ocean.  The project will develop a web site for middle school (grades 6-8) and the general public that will provide near real-time, daily access to deep submergence and oceanographic research that is conducted using the facilities of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).  Multidisciplinary field programs will take place over the next two years (1999-2001) in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  These cruises involve scientists from many leading oceanographic institutions and universities, and focus on various problems associated with mid-ocean ridge volcanism, and the chemical, physical and biological processes associated with hydrothermal venting at the ridge axis.  Backed by educational modules, the web site will allow students and the general public to share in the daily challenges and discoveries of scientific research at sea, and to learn about basic scientific principles through studies of the natural environment.  The \"Access to Inner Space (AIS)\" web site will consist of two major components.  A series of Information Modules (InfoMods) will provide both general information about the oceans and the people that study them, as well as cruise-specific information about the natural systems to be studied during each cruise, the participating scientists, and the data and sample-collecting methodologies and technologies to be used.  Various Seagoing Modules (SeaMods) will provide the mechanism to enable students and the public to access daily updates of the progress of the cruise, including data modules with suggestions of how students might use the data to discover something interesting, and images of seafloor features and animals, and shipboard activities.  Post-cruise, the material will be edited and repackaged so that students can follow the progress of the voyage through the SeaMods, with illustrative materials to explain the scientific principles underlying the collection of data and its analysis.  This material will then be made available both on the AIS web site and on CD-ROMs.  The project will draw on teaching organizations, partnerships and societies (Sea Education Association, Massachusetts Marine Educators, Woods Hole Science and Technology Education Partnership), as well as educational materials developers (Turnstone Publishing Group) to 1) develop the educational modules, 2) correlate materials with national science education standards, and 3) test the modules in the classroom.  The web site will be advertised through these same groups, as well as through the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) and the National Marine Education Association (NMEA).  Finally, the web site will be provided through \"kiosks\" in selected museums and aquaria.  These would house a computer link to the web site, thereby allowing the general public to participate in the daily activities of the cruises when they are in progress, or to look at the results from the most recent cruise and its educational modules.  This project represents the first stage of a long-term goal to provide routine access to daily oceanographic research using ships and vehicles based at WHOI.  The intention is that the conceptual approach developed as a result of this work will have broad application for ocean-going marine scientists, and for universities and institutions that operate research vessels, and will allow them to use similar techniques to promote ocean science education and public outreach at their institutions in the future.  In consideration of these long-term objectives, WHOI has committed a significant amount (~2.5 times the funds requested from NSF) of cost sharing for this project.\r\n",
