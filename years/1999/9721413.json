 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enables the PI, an applied mathematician and numerical analyst, to spend a year in the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) department at Penn State, immerse himself in the full research and educational activities of the MSE department, and conduct a joint research with his hosts on numerical simulation of materials microstructural evolution.\r\n\r\nThe microstructural evolution will be modeled by using a continuum field approach which results in a set of well-posed partial differential equations that can be rigorously analyzed.  Efficient and accurate numerical schemes/software for solving these equations will be developed, validated and applied to a number of challenging problems of current interest.\r\n\r\nThis project will not only expand the awareness and use of important mathematical advances and state-of-the-art numerical methods/software which have the potential to make significant impact on the materials science, result in improved models and numerical schemes which will contribute to a better understanding of the complex process of microstructural evolution, and provide new fundamental, practical insights which can provide US industry with a competitive edge, but also set up the stage for a lasting\r\ncollaboration in a broader scale between the Math and MSE departments.\r\n\r\nThis IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).\r\n",
