 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaboration among the Department of Biology and the Center of Excellence in Math and Science Education (COE) at Black Hills State College and a nearby tribal college, Oglala Lakota College (OLC), adapts and implements within molecular biology an approach, first developed in geology, to implement research based courses exploring the local environment (DUE 9551226). The past approach used Global Positioning Systems to provide data on the local environment. In the current project, faculty, pre-service and in-service teachers participate in workshops in molecular biology both to upgrade their skills and knowledge and to help implement courses adapting molecular approaches to the study of rare and sensitive local species. Two of the revised courses (Genetics and Conservation Genetics and Bio-diversity) are shared between the University and OLC.  The University delivers the lecture portions of the courses to OLC by distance education. The accompanying laboratories are taught by OLC faculty who have participated in the workshops.  In addition, undergraduate students at both institutions are offered research opportunities within these redesigned curricula and will be part of the workshops offered. The research opportunities available for preservice students and others and the courses themselves focus on conservation genetics of rare or sensitive native species in the region. Preservice students are an important component of the student population involved.  Inservice teachers involved act as mentors for the preservice students.",
