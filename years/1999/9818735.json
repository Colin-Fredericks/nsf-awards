Accessible to teachers, students, and parents over the Web, this resource includes problems and problem sets for development, practice, assessment, and integration of concepts and skills.  The problems are classified by topic, difficulty level, and use of technology, and keyed to existing and newly published, reform-minded, middle school and high school curricula.  The website also supports a moderated electronic forum for discussion on the mathematics in the problems and related issues, and for the contribution of new problems.  A research component provides insight into teachers' uses and needs related to implementation of reform curricula.\r\n\r\n",
