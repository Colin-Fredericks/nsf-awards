 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  will establish the Archive of Exemplary Behavioral Science Research Instruments (BSRI) on the Internet and on CD-ROM.  A printed Guide to the Behavioral Science Research Instrument Archive will also be produced. The BSRI Archive will contain searchable, edit-ready, and print-ready machine-readable versions of approximately 200 exemplary demographic, behavioral, and health science instruments-questionnaires, medical forms, interview protocols--used to collect the quantitative research data in the Sociometrics Data Archives and to document the effectiveness of the promising social intervention programs comprising the Sociometrics Program Archives.  Each of the topically-focused data and program archives that will contribute research and evaluation instruments to BSRI is a \"best-of-the-lot\" collection, carefully chosen using criteria of scientific merit, substantive utility, and policy relevance by a National Advisory Panel of scientists who are experts in that topical focus of the archives.  Norms for the scales and items comprising the BSRI instruments will be included in the archive in the form of scale means and standard deviations, item frequencies or response distributions, and item cross-tabulations with age, race/ethnicity, and gender, obtained from the linked data archives at Sociometrics.  If Phase II concept refinement explorations are successful, BSRI will also contain a link to the corresponding data file that will allow a researcher to select variables for a fully documented SPSS or SAS analysis extract file from BSRI's variable listing, original instrument, and/or item statistics.  This new feature should be of enormous help to the researcher, as it will allow him/her to see the complete context of the item prior to selecting it for analysis.\r\n     BSRI's instrument search, edit, and print capabilities-along with its development in print, CD-ROM, and Internet formats-make BSRI a natural product for several thousand institutional target markets serving several hundred thousand individual users.   Among BSI's target markets are: (1) academic markets, including 5,000+ social science departments, 160,000+ social and health science professors and researchers working in the topical areas covered by BSRI, 3,000+ main libraries at colleges and universities, and 100+ medical libraries in universities; (2) policymaking and business markets, such as the 200+ member Assoc. of Public Data Users, and (3) general information resource markets, such as 9,000+ public libraries.\r\n",
