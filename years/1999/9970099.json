 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - 9970099\r\n\r\n\r\n This award supports the acquisition of a Philips XL30 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a backscattered electron detector, an integrated EDAX  non-dispersive X-ray microanalysis system, and a Cressington 208 HR turbo sputter coater.  The high-resolution XL30 and its support equipment will replace a 15 year old ISI SX40 SEM, that has extremely limited capabilities.  The XL30 will greatly enhance seven different research programs, four of which are presently supported by project grants from the National Science Foundation.  These research projects cover a wide range of topics, from the ultrastructure of dolphin blubber to the mechanisms whereby crustaceans and other organisms form calcified structures.  The wide range of topics described indicates how an instrument, and, in fact, microscopy as a whole can add to the scientific information to be gained from almost any set of experimental procedures.  The XL30 will also greatly enhance the range of analytical tools and training offered to graduate and undergraduate students at UNCW.\r\nThe XL30, because of its use of low accelerating voltages, allows one to view uncoated, as well as coated specimens. Investigators interested in biomineralization could, for example, examine the interface between calcite crystals and organic matrix in oyster shell with an atomic force microscope (AFM) after it has been visualized with the XL30.  The ability to capture a high resolution image and subsequently use multiple analytic tools (e.g. AFM, nuclear magnetic resonance, material testing, antibody probes) on the same specimen would greatly enhance the on-going research programs.  The X-ray analysis component, especially the mapping capabilities, will likewise enhance several programs.\r\nThe Microscopy Laboratory at UNCW is part of a growing Biological and Marine Sciences Program that includes a new 18 million dollar laboratory-sciences building and a 17 million dollar Marine Sciences Facility that is nearing completion.  In addition to supporting the specific programs described, National Science Foundation support of a XL30 would greatly increase the scope of the analytical and microscopic research possible at UNCW and enhance its growing basic research programs.\r\n",
