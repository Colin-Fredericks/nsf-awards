 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organizational theorists have become increasingly interested in the study of organizational networks and how they differ from markets and hierarchies. However, the majority of the research has focused on long-term, open-ended relationships and neglected the more elusive, but equally prevalent short-term relationships (e.g., single project collaborations). This doctoral dissertation project analyzes one specific type of flexible organizational network called a Short-Term Network Organization (STNO). An STNO is defined as an intentionally created organizational entity which combines independent contributors for the objective of accomplishing a single short-term task. While flexibility advantages and entrepreneurial opportunities of network organizations have been the focus of attention in the academic and practitioner literature, this work focuses on the substantial coordination challenges STNOs present. Combining transaction cost economics and institutional theory, we hypothesize that STNOs will: (1) strengthen psychological contracts, (2) support collective sanctioning systems, and (3) rely on industry-wide standardized STNO coordination practices to reduce transaction costs and to improve STNO performance. Hypotheses will be tested on a stratified random sample of 400 movie projects from 1930-1950. The dissertation contributes to organizational theory by conceptualizing STNOs and the governance challenges they imply. It introduces and tests three strategies organizations in the movie industry may have found to address these challenges. If successful, the results will provide practitioners with needed guidance for the implementation of a little-understood organizational form.",
