 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Doctoral Dissertation Research: Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variation of Ancient Eastern North American Arctic Peoples\"\r\n\r\nThe questions addressed here have to do with the genetic admixture between the people of the Paleoeskimo Dorset and Neoeskimo Thule cultures. Was there contact between the bearers of these cultures as the Thule culture spread across the Canadian Arctic? Or, alternatively, had the Dorset bearers disappeared before the Thule culture arrived in the Canadian Arctic? Further, who where the Sadlermiut of Southampton Island? To answer these questions, ancient DNA will be extracted from skeletal material excavated at Eastern North American Arctic arhaeological sites spanning the West coast of Hudson Bay and Ungava Bay in Canada to Greenland. The hypervariable segment 1 (HVS 1) of the mitochondrial genome will be amplified from the ancient DNA samples using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and sequenced. Pairwise sequence differences will be used in phylogenetic analyses to assess the genetic relationship between peoples of the Dorset, Thule, and Sadlermiut cultures. The results will address the current debate over the evolutionary relationships between members of the prehistoric Dorset and Thule cultures and assess whether the Sadlermiut are more closely related to the Dorset, Thule, or living Inuit groups.\r\n",
