Its applications occur in  numerous areas of science, technology, management, etc., and include problems as diverse as those of determining the optimal locations of warehouses, VLSI chip design, airline crew scheduling, etc.  The main goal of DO'99 is to provide an overview of the current state of the art in the field of discrete optimization.  For this purpose, 23 of the most prominent researchers active in this field will provide state of the art presentations of various subareas of this discipline.  The current project's objective is to make it possible for a larger number of junior researchers, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students to participate in the meeting and attend the lectures of these world-renowned experts.  At the same time, these participants will also have the opportunity to present papers about their own research, and to establish contacts both with the senior participants and with their peers.  The funds made available through this project will be used entirely to provide stipends for participants. \r\n\r\n",
