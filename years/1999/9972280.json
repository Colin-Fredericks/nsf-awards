 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proof-of-concept EMD project is developing case studies and teaching materials to be used by computer science professors to integrate ethics and social impact issues into traditional computer science courses.  The project builds upon the recommendations of ACM/IEEE Curricula 91 and the NSF-funded ImpactCS project, which provided the learning objectives and implementation guidelines for integrating ethics and social impact across the computer science curriculum. \r\n\r\nA Social Impact Analysis (SIA) Toolkit and two historical case studies are being developed as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the efficacy of the case study approach to teaching these issues.  These materials are being field-tested at the Pi's home institution and three other institutions.  The prototype materials are being presented to publishers for future hard-copy dissemination in the form of a textbook of case studies, lesson plans, and homework activities for students.\r\n\r\nOutcomes of the project include a prototype website containing the materials, papers presenting the evaluation data from the four test sites given at conferences , and the presentation of workshops at national conferences as a preliminary dissemination strategy.",
