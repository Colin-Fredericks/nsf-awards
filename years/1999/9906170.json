 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the of migration of human rights norms that have been developed outside Israel into the local domestic context. One part of this study focuses upon the relationship between human rights groups in Israel, especially those focusing on the rights of the Palestinian minority and non-citizen \"foreign workers,\" and the key organizations and individuals supporting them from abroad.  The other part of the study considers the government's efforts to deal with the human-rights demands being made upon it.  The decisions of the Israeli High Court, legislative and executive decisions, and coverage by the mass media suggest the direction and content of these efforts.  The methodology is ethnographic, including participant observation and interviews with non-governmental organizations involved in human-rights activism in Israel. Archival research in specialized libraries and other facilities documenting civil-rights matters and assessment of relevant case law are additional elements of this project.  The research will contribute to understanding of the evolution of national sovereignty in an era of global human rights and human-rights activism.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
