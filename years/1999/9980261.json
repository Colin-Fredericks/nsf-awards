 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,  for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) project entitled, \"Multi-media Based Tools for Integration of Technology, Analysis and Design in Materials Handling Engineering Education,\" under the direction of Dr. Sunderesh Heragu.  The project's goals are to develop a multi-media based system for integrative instruction in materials handling engineering which can be distributed at a very low cost to U.S. universities via the web and CD-ROM media.  The system to be developed by a multi-disciplinary, multi-university team of technical content and multi-media technology experts, as well as communication, learning, evaluation and cognitive psychology experts, will contain modules on three major categories of analysis of these systems.  These modules will: a) introduce students to major categories of materials handling equipment, b) illustrate industrial applications of a major material handling device in each category, and c) teach the problem solving process through an extensive series of models, algorithms, problems and solutions which illustrate the creative application of quantitative tools and design problems in solving technology selection and technology analysis problems.  This will include tools for direct comparisons of the performance of alternative systems with an animated illustration of the effect of a decision on system performance.  The proposed system will be the first to directly link modern materials handling technology with the vast technical literature to which it applies.",
