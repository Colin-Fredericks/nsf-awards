 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division and the Atomic, Molecular, Optical, and Plasma Physics program of the Physics Division, Wolfgang Ernst of Pennsylvania State University will study intramolecular interactions in metallic aggregates, specifically, small alkali-atom clusters.  Molecular beam spectroscopy using narrow-band lasers and microwave radiation as well as laser ionization and mass selective detection will be used to investigate species produced using two different methods.  In the first technique free-jet expansions of alkali metal vapors will generate small alkali clusters that are studied at very high resolution using resonant two-photon ionization (R2PI) spectroscopy, ionization detected microwave spectroscopy, and optical-optical double resonance.  Insight into details of Jahn-Teller (JT) and pseudo Jahn-Teller potential energy surfaces will result, and questions about a Berry phase in the evolution of nuclear and electronic wavefunctions will be answered.  In the second set of experiments alkali aggregates will form on cold helium droplets, which act as inert substrates.  The metal aggregates acquire the 0.4 K temperature of the droplets, and the resulting simplified spectra will be studied by laser-induced fluorescence, laser-microwave double resonance, laser ionization, and time-of-flight mass spectroscopy.  Species investigated will include different alkali metals and products of reactions of alkalis with simple molecules. \r\n\r\n Spectroscopy of atomic and molecular species on ultracold helium drops is similar to matrix isolation spectroscopy and can give correspondingly useful information about unstable chemical intermediates.  Results of this work can also be effective in testing quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics models, developing schemes for coherent control of molecules using femtosecond laser pulses, and understanding reactions involving other small gas-phase species, such as air pollutants and reactive intermediates of combustion processes.\r\n",
