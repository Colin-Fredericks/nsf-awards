The researchers will be undertaking a study concerning the phenomenology of physics beyond the standard model.  It is desirable to combine the phenomenological and theoretical expertise of the collaborators to make maximal progress on important research problems at the forefront of particle physics.  They will be undertaking studies on the following models:  1) physics at linear e+e- colliders;  \r\n2) Higgs boson physics;  3) supersymmetry and rand unified theories;  4) neutrino mass and oscillations;  5) astrophysics: neutrinos and SUSY dark matter; and  6) B physics.   \r\n\r\nThis project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  Both groups are strong in electroweak phenomenology and grand unified theories (including supersymmetry).  The research results are expected to be beneficial in advancing the understanding of basic particle physics questions at the forefront of the field.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of postdocs and graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  \r\n***\r\n",
