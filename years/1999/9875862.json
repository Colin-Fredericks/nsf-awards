The main objective of this project is to develop a computer test-bed for first-principle simulation of blast-resistant structures, and to improve the education in this area. To predict multi-scale structural failure under blast loads, it is planned that the transition among three basic types of governing differential equations be investigated based on the physics involved, and a moving discretization method in the domain of influence be developed to discretize different scales. A coordinated educational program, integrated with the research program, is to be performed to promote undergraduate, graduate and continuing education in blast-resistant design, to encourage minority students to get involved into advanced topics in science and engineering, and to improve the public awareness of terrorism and threat prevention. This research and educational program is an important part of the newly established National Center for Explosion Resistant Design that represents a strong partnership among government, industry and academia.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
