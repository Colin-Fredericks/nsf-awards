 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to help students learn about optics in\r\nfreshman/sophomore physics courses and in upper level physics courses.  We\r\nwill produce a prototypic set of educational materials: a Web-based, 3D\r\ninteractive computer graphics system with session logging capabilities.\r\nWe will also investigate the possibility of giving the system\r\ncollaborative capabilities.\r\n\r\nWe have previously developed a 3D interactive computer graphics system\r\ncalled The Optics Project (TOP).  TOP has been tested in the classroom at\r\ntwo universities, and received excellent student evaluations.  We now know\r\nhow to port TOP to the Web, making it available for students with PC's.\r\nFor example, a student can point his/her browser at a URL (such as\r\nhttp://www.erc.msstate.edu/~foley/webtop/ ) and select the single slit\r\nsubmodule; the browser then loads the 3D environment in which the student\r\ncan change the width of a slit and see the diffraction pattern on an\r\nobservation screen change.\r\n\r\nOur objectives are as follows.  (1) Make Web versions of the seven TOP\r\nmodules.  We call this Web version WebTOP.  (2) Create a new Lasers\r\nmodule.  (3) Enable the automatic generation of session logs that can be\r\nreplayed, edited, and analyzed.  (4) Investigate the possibility of giving\r\nthe system collaborative capabilities.  In addition to developing the\r\nsoftware, we plan to aggressively disseminate and evaluate it.  We will\r\ncontinue to give presentations at regional and national meetings, as we\r\ndid for TOP.  As each new WebTOP module is completed, we will put it on\r\nour server, so that others may begin using it.  We will hold workshops to\r\nshow others how to use WebTOP.  We will coordinate with other universities\r\nand colleges who use WebTOP and travel, when possible, to help them get\r\nstarted, as we did with TOP.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the two years, we expect the outcomes to be: (a) an\r\ninteractive computer graphics system which runs on the Web and has session\r\nlogging capabilities, and (b) a large and growing set of university users\r\nwhich will use the software.
