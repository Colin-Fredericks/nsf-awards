 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economics has historically been a classic example of a science in which laboratory methods are impossible. Consistent with this view, it has generally been taught as a theory intensive science, not as an observational one. Because economics involves so much abstract reasoning and analysis, when it is taught with this emphasis on theory, many of the concepts are difficult for students to grasp.\r\n\r\nThe notion that economics is not an experimental science is changing, in large part due to the increase in research conducted using experimental methods. In addition, as evidence of the benefits of active learning for students has accumulated, more faculty have switched their teaching methods to actively engage students in the process of learning.  Introducing experimental methods into the economics classroom is a natural step, warranted both by the evolution of the discipline and the need to more actively involve students.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of this project are to develop course materials for introductory economics (principles) that integrate classroom experiments into the curricula and to assess the efficacy of this method of instruction. The evaluative phase of the project will seek to assess the impact of the new curricula on the depth of student learning, retention of economic knowledge, and attitudes towards the study of economics, among others.  The evaluation will also be applied to five new macroeconomics experiments being developed at another institution.  \r\n\r\nTo achieve these objectives, this study proposes a three year controlled experiment.  Students in principles of economics courses will be separated into control and treatment classes. The control classes will be conducted using a traditional lecture/class discussion format. The treatment classes will supplement the lecture and class discussion with classroom experiments. Relative performance on an instrument designed specifically for this project that employs Bloom's taxonomy about the hierarchy of learning (knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation) will serve as the basis for assessing the impact of classroom experiments (Benjamin Bloom, editor, \"Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, David McKay Company, Inc. 1956).  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
