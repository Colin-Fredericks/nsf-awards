The proposers request funding in order to ensure participation by leading researchers from Europe and Australia and to assist graduate students and recent PhD recipients.  The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for merging theory and practice of computations with groups.  It is expected that this will result in increased understanding of the deeper mathematical issues that underlie group computations, and that these will have important algorithmic implications as we move toward the the next generation of computer architectures.  That this objective is likely to be met is evidenced by previous related workshops on ``Groups and Computation'' held at DIMACS (in Rutgers University) in 1991 and 1995.  A primary goal of those workshops was to foster a dialogue between researchers studying the complexity of group computations and those engaged in the development of practical algorithms.  There were many comments by participants, both during  and afterwards, that this goal had been achieved beyond the organizers' expectations, and had led to new perspectives and new collaborations.  As a direct result, practical versions were devised for algorithms initially developed by theoreticians to improve worst case asymptotic running times; some of these have been implemented in the major computational group theory systems. Providing opportunities for graduate students and younger researchers, both as participants and as speakers, was another  of the many successful aspects of  previous workshops, and will be an important feature of this one as well.\r\n\r\nComputational group theory is an interdisciplinary field involving the use of groups to solve problems in computer science and mathematics.  The conference will explore the interplay of research which has taken place in a number of broad areas: symbolic algebra, theoretical computer science, group theory, and applications of group computation.  In addition to talks on a wide variety of mathematical and computer science issues, at past conferences on this subject there have been numerous talks on links to statistics, circuit design, digital signal processing, and the uses of parallel architectures within this branch of symbolic algebra.  The major computational group theory systems employed internationally have had impacts on research within mathematics as well as its applications; based on previous experience, fast new approaches will come out of the proposed conference and will be implemented in these systems.\r\n",
