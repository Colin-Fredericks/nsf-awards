 "awd_abstract_narration": "9876575\r\nThe focus of this project is on a family of intracellular lipid binding proteins. These proteins are responsible for the solubilization and delivery of hydrophobic ligands within a cell.  The lipid binding proteins bind most avidly to fatty acids and retinoids although some weak association with such molecules as heme and lysophospholipids does occur.  Despite the wide variability in primary sequence, the 3-D structure of the family members, as determined by multidimensional NMR and X-ray crystallography, are remarkably superimposable.  The signature feature of all the lipid binding proteins is a beta-barrel fold forming an internal, water-filled cavity which serves as the ligand binding domain. Once inside, the ligand is sequestered from the external milieu and is held rigidly along one wall of the binding domain, displacing about one-third of the cavity water.  Despite the finding of the ligand bound to the protein within the cavity, there is no obvious site for ligand entry/exit.  The adipocyte lipid binding proteins bind to fatty acids and are used as model systems for the analysis of the entire class of lipid binding proteins.  The availability of structural information has allowed for the analysis of several questions relating to not only the physical basis for protein lipid interaction, but also for the molecular analysis of ligand binding affinity and selectivity.  For example, a large water-filled cavity that serves as the ligand binding domain seems intuitively contradictory to the purpose of the proteins.  If the proteins facilitate the solubilization of water-insoluble lipids, why enclose them in a cavity filled with water?  How do ligands enter and exit the cavity if there is no opening?  What are the thermodynamic factors which govern lipid binding?  What determines the ligand binding affinity and selectivity?  Do such proteins serve as passive intracellular fatty acid buffers or are they active molecular chaperones, directing the vectoral movement of lipid within cells? The following hypothesis addresses these issues:  The adipocyte lipid binding protein functions as a molecular chaperone for fatty acids, facilitating the directed movement of lipolytically derived fatty acids from the adipocyte lipid droplet to the plasma membrane.  This project tests this hypothesis by assessing the dynamic nature of the fatty acid binding process with a series of portal mutants designed to address cavity accessibility; and mapping the contact interface between the hormone-sensitive lipase and the adipocyte lipid binding protein.\r\n\r\nWhile water soluble compounds may freely diffuse in biological systems, specific carrier proteins have evolved for the solubilization and delivery of molecules which have limited solubility in aqueous systems. The focus of this research is on the relationship between structure and function in one family of hydrophobic ligand carrier proteins which function within the intracellular environment, the lipid binding proteins.  Just as there are carrier proteins that function to solubilize and deliver hydrophobic molecules in the circulatory system (e.g., lipoproteins, albumin), there exists an analogous family of proteins that are found intracellularly.  These proteins, which have been termed the lipid binding proteins, are responsible for the solubilization and delivery of hydrophobic ligands within a cell.   Their role as possible chaperones will be examined.\r\n",
