 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diagrams are used everywhere to illustrate complex relations, present data, document designs, and otherwise provide schematic views of information.  In the near future, virtually every important document will be available in electronic (digital) form.  Whereas many automated techniques have been developed to index, retrieve, summarize and translate electronic documents based on their textual content, few comparable techniques are known for similarly exploiting the diagrams in such documents.   Building on his prior research, the PI will develop a new class of automated tools for vector (not bitmap) diagrams that analyze the graphical elements and the text associated with them to create rich descriptions of diagram syntax and semantics.  These tools will allow collections of diagrams to be intelligently indexed and queried, and will form the basis for future systems that can compare, merge, summarize, and otherwise manipulate diagrammatic information in useful ways.  Two dimensional diagrams such as data graphs, block diagrams, gene diagrams, technical drawings, maps, and others used in science, engineering, education, and industry will be studied.  The research will lead to enhanced understanding of the syntax and semantics of diagrams, and to efficient systems for extracting syntactic and semantic information from vector diagrams;   it will thus provide a firm foundation for the integration of diagrams on an equal footing with text in future information systems and digital libraries.",
