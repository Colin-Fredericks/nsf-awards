 "awd_abstract_narration": "The isolated and simplified ecosystems of Hawaii offer both natural laboratories for ecological and evolutionary research and challenges for the conservation of this unique biota.  The last few decades have seen a broad-front development of research and training in response to these opportunities and conservation responsibilities.  The Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology  (EECB) program at UH Hilo melds these interagency activities and mandates into a integrated undergraduate curriculum for the first time in the state.  The Big Island of Hawaii offers extreme local climatic diversity in temperature and rainfall with exceptional opportunities for field laboratory experiences.  In addition, the unique biota of Hawaii provides a tremendous resource of plants and animals to investigate in undergraduate laboratory courses.  The EECB program teaches basic and advanced concepts of ecology and evolution by adapting the powerful research design of an NSF-funded Hawaiian rain forest ecosystem study that utilizes an elevation gradient that begins near the UHH campus.  Field laboratory classes visit these established sites and conduct similar fieldwork, using vegetation monitoring training material developed by the Secretariat for Conservation Biology, an interagency umbrella organization.  The EECB program also adapts curriculum from the NSF-sponsored Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement Workshop on \"Molecular Genetic Analysis Applied to Evolution, Ecology, and Systematic Biology:  An Extended Laboratory Course.\"  In addition, several computer simulation programs are being incorporated into the undergraduate courses.  Some of these programs have been developed in previous NSF-sponsored projects, including \"Populus\"--an evolutionary genetic program.  Animal physiological ecology components of the proposed curriculum are adapted from courses and curricula at Cornell University, UCLA, UC-Irvine, and Western Washington University.  Most such curricula focus on animal adaptation to climatic diversity and offer field experience with their local ecosystems.",
