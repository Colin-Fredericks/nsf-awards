 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Edwin Vedejs, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies of chiral nucleophiles and electrophiles in relay catalysis.  Through the investigation of new methods for the synthesis of chiral phosphine and pyridine derivatives, Professor Vedejs is developing new catalysts designed to serve as chiral relays in a multi-phase transfer technique.  Following attachment of potentially incompatible stoichiometric reagents to solid-phase supports, the soluble chiral relay agent is activated by one supported reagent, then diffuses to the other supported reagent, delivering the activating subunit.  Variations of this technique are used to effect catalytic parallel kinetic resolution, wherein each enantiomer of a racemic mixture is derivatized by two simultaneous catalytic processes.  Phase isolation and relay catalysis are essential to the success of this technique, which offers promise for dynamic kinetic resolution of sulfinyl and phosphinyl chlorides, hindered tertiary alcohols, amines, and N-acyl amines.\r\n\r\nMany molecules displaying biological activity can exist in either of two forms, related to each other as mirror images, and frequently only one member of a pair of mirror image isomers displays desirable activity.  With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Edwin Vedejs, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Michigan, is investigating novel methods for the preparation of single isomers of such \"chiral\" compounds.  By attaching two potentially reactive reagents to solid supports, Professor Vedejs is able to harness their reactivity, with small molecule \"shuttles\" required to effect their reaction with one another.  By using chiral shuttle molecules, selective syntheses of chiral products are achieved, offering access to a variety of chiral compounds of utility as intermediates in the synthesis of more complex molecules.\r\n",
