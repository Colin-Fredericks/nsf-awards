 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support the Peabody Museum at Harvard University will complete curation of the Hemenway archaeological collection and make it available to scientists in a manner which will maximize research efficiency. Because relevant catalogue and storage data are not currently available electronic and paper records are hard to sort and use, researchers have difficulty studying the materials. The Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological Expedition (1886-1889) conducted significant excavations at half a dozen pre-Classic and Classic Hohokam sites in the Gila River Valley of Arizona and at two late prehistoric Zuni sites in western New Mexico. The team also conducted excavation or surface collection at an additional 25 Hohokam sites. In total, over 7300 objects were collected including hundreds of whole or reconstructed vessels. Ceramic spindle whorls, figurines and ornaments are also present. Lithics include projectile points, knives, picks, manos and metates, mortars and pestles, palettes, rubbing and abrading stones, reamers and rasps. Shell objects include needles and scrapers, marine shell beads and ornaments, some inlaid with colored stone and/or painted. Because of excellent organic preservation the collection includes wooden handles and tools as well as fragments of fabric and basketry. These materials have the potential to shed important light on prehistoric adaptation in the Southwestern US region. These objects are accompanied by the expedition's written records, drawings and maps. However a number of problems limit researcher access. These include the presence of uncatalogued and unlabelled items, an incomplete and inconsistent electronic database, inadequate correlation of cataloging data and field information and inconvenient organization of materials in storage. With National Science Foundation support, cataloguing and data entry will be completed, record photographs will be taken of approximately 200 selected artifacts or groups of artifacts, materials will be reorganized in storage draws, documentation accompanying the objects will also be computerized and an electronic interface for researchers' use will be developed.\r\n\r\nMuseums such as the Peabody house collections of immense scientific value. The Hemenway Collection, if readily available can provide a treasure trove of information for researchers interested in the prehistoric Southwest USA and this award facilitate access to it.\r\n",
