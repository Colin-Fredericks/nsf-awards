 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alan Weinstein\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nABSTRACT OF PROJECT: POISSON GEOMETRY AND QUANTIZATION\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Alan Weinstein\r\n\r\nPoisson structures are the ``shadow of quantum noncommutativity'' on\r\ndifferentiable manifolds, manifested as singular foliations with\r\nsymplectic structures along the leaves.  Weinstein will investigate\r\nseveral aspects of Poisson geometry and its relations to\r\nnoncommutative algebra.  The central part of the project, motivated by\r\nthe study of convexity theorems in symplectic and Poisson geometry,\r\nactually belongs to riemannian geometry.  Versions of Ulam's ``general\r\nstability problem'' concerning approximate homomorphisms from groups\r\nand approximately invariant submanifolds for compact group actions\r\nhave been reduced to averaging problems for families of submanifolds.\r\nSeveral methods of averaging will be investigated.  The averaging\r\nmethods will then be applied to the classification of proper Lie\r\ngroupoids, with applications to convexity theory and isoparametric\r\nsubmanifold geometry.  A separate part of the project will use the\r\ngeometry and quantization of Dirac structures (singular foliations\r\nwith presymplectic structures along the leaves), to complete the\r\nclassification of quantum tori up to Morita equivalence.\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with various extensions of the notions of\r\nsymmetry and symmetry group.  Initially, one thinks of a symmetry of a\r\nphysical or mathematical object as a transformation which leaves the\r\nstructure of the object invariant.  The collection of symmetries of a\r\ngiven object, together with the operation of applying one symmetry\r\nafter another, forms a \"symmetry group\" whose analysis aids the study\r\nof the object under investigation.  Many important applications\r\nrequire generalizations of the notion of symmetry group, and even the\r\nnotion of symmetry itself.  First of all, one has symmetries defined\r\nonly on part of an object (e.g. between individual molecules in a\r\ncomplex compound, rather) or symmetries which leave the properties of\r\nan object only approximately invariant (e.g. in the study of real\r\ndata, whose symmetries are generally imperfect).  Through a method of\r\naveraging, we intend to derive true symmetries from imperfect ones;\r\nthis idealization could reveal the underlying structure of an object\r\ndespite our imperfect perception of it.  The method of averaging may\r\nalso be applicable to problems in computer graphics, such as the\r\n\"morphing\" of one curve or surface into another by a continuous family\r\nof curves or surfaces.  Part of the project involves algebraic systems\r\nrelated to those in which the usual associative law of composition:\r\n(ab)c = a(bc) is satisfied only approximately.  Such systems have\r\nrecently been shown relevant to the hypothetical \"M-theory\" which may\r\nunravel some of the mysteries of high-energy physics.\r\n",
