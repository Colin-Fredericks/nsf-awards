 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of the current research is to understand the neural pathways and mechanisms underlying  motivated behaviors, which are complex behaviors dependent on both intrinsic and external factors. The aim of the present project is to delineate the neural pathway by which somatosensory and viscerosensory inputs reach motivational centers in the forebrain of male rats, and to investigate the functional role of this pathway in motivated behaviors.\r\n\tDr. Coolen's preliminary work has provided strong evidence for a candidate pathway that may relay somatic and visceral sensory information to higher brain centers that control behavior. This pathway includes a subset of neurons in the lumbar spinal cord that project to specific thalamic nucleus, which, in turn projects to forebrain regions critical for motivated behaviors. The current proposal will confirm the existence of this pathway and further investigate its functions using neuroanatomical tracing techniques in combination with markers of neural activation. Moreover, this project will begin to address the key question of whether or not this type of sensory information is critical for the expression of motivated behaviors. The behavioral significance of the identified anatomical pathway will be tested by placing discrete lesions in its nodal points, the lumbar spinal cord and thalamus, and examining the behavioral consequences of their destruction.\r\n\tTogether, these studies will provide a framework and well- defined model for exploring how sensory pathways regulate components of complex, motivated behaviors.\r\n\r\n",
