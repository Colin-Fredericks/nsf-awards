 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in active memory of sensory experience, but short-term memory apparently involves cortical memory networks that are more widely distributed.  The general objective of this study is to clarify how the cerebral cortex retains information in the short term for goal-directed behavior.  This project uses two methods of recording cortical activity in monkeys performing visual short-term memory tasks: the recording of surface field potentials and the recording of optical intrinsic signals. This combination will allow the study of neural network activity within and across cortical areas with high spatial and temporal resolution.  Correlation of location and time course will be examined between electrical and optical measurements during task performance.  Two specific hypotheses will be tested: (a) neuronal activation develops over prefrontal and parietal cortex during retention of spatial and nonspatial memoranda; and (b) in parietal cortex, that activation is more prominent during retention of spatial memoranda than during nonspatial memoranda.  Because of the phenomenological relation between active memory and consciousness, an understanding of the dynamics of active memory may help elucidate the role of the cerebral cortex in conscious states.  Analysis of electrical and optical signals should reveal underlying topographic specificity in the retention of memoranda within the cortical areas explored.  In addition, by contrasting the optical data against those from an established electrical method, this study should help substantiate the biophysical basis of optical imaging and its use in cognitive neuroscience.\r\n    Results will have an impact beyond cortical physiology by leading to a better understanding of memory and consciousness, and will be important to technological developments in optical imaging.\r\n",
