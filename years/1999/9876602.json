In the workshop they will experience and model all steps in the process by which students go from a broad topic of interest to a highly defined research problem.  The following academic year the teachers will attend five all-day Saturday sessions or a one-week follow-up session for out of state sites.  These sessions emphasize the acquisition of key skills by teachers needed to implement the high school research course.  The resulting high school research course is a three-year program of study.  In year one the student identifies a research problem, recruits a scientist mentor, and locates a research site.  Year two is devoted to doing research during the academic year and summer.  Year three continues the research work as well as emphasizing the communication of results in local, regional, and national symposia and student competitions.  It is anticipated that after five years 400 of some 800 public high schools and 30 private schools in NY State will have established a Science Research course.  To test the transportability of the model 80 teachers will be selected from outside NY State.  These teachers will come from California, Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, and West Virginia.  They will attend workshops in their state.  Participating teachers will receive three graduate credits in the Department of Educational Theory at SUNY-Albany.\r\n",
