 "awd_abstract_narration": "Induction motors have found considerable applications in industry due to their reliability, ruggedness and relatively low cost.  Because there is no mechanical commutation and no sparks are produced, induction motors have found broad applications in volatile environments.  In spite of these advantages, the induction motor presents challenging problems in the detection, diagnosis and isolation of motor faults and the control of the electrical machine.\r\n\r\nAccording to previous studies which have examined the reliability of induction motors and their associated failure modes, the three most probable failures are: mechanical failures in the rotor shaft bearings, short circuits in the stator windings, and rotor bar failures.  There is currently a significant need for the development of detection and diagnosis algorithms that can monitor, in real-time, the health of an induction motor.\r\n\r\nThe problem of modeling induction motors with a saturating magnetic circuit has always been an important subject.  It is well recognized that a linear magnetic circuit machine model does not capture all the dynamics of a real machine, especially the cross-saturation effects.  Although saturation modeling has been used for predicting the transient behavior of the motor, most of the previous work on control does not consider the effects of saturation on motor performance.  In controller synthesis, the common assumption of the linearity of the magnetic circuit is often justified by including the flux magnitude in the outputs to be regulated.  During machine transients the flux magnitude can exceed these saturation limits and the performance of the machine can be seriously compromised.  Also in many variable torque applications, it is desirable to operate in the magnetic saturation region to allow the machine to develop higher torque.\r\n\r\nThis proposal outlines a research program focusing on the development and evaluation (simulation and experimental) of algorithms for the detection and diagnosis of the most common types of motor faults and for the design of advanced control algorithms under a wide variety of motor operating conditions (e.g. magnetic and actuator saturation) and applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
