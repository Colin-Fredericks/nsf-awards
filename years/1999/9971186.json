 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on (1) data-driven estimation, testing, and multi-step prediction for non- and semi- parametric autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) models, in order to combine the exponentially decaying feature of classic ARCH models with nonparametric flexibility; (2) estimation and lag selection using plug-in bandwidths for non- and semi- parametric seasonal autoregressive models, with improved efficiency for the semiparametric models; (3) test of higher order interaction terms and a linearity test that leads to simpler models with easier interpretation, and improved estimation accuracy; (4) lag selection for multivariate time series and volatility functions, which aids in identifying parsimonious models and hidden structures among variables; and (5) nonparametric multi-step prediction for additive and functional coefficient autoregressive models.\r\n\r\nA time series consists of numbers observed over time.  Economic indicators such as the daily exchange rate of the Euro against the US Dollar and the monthly rate of unemployment in the United States are important financial time series. In the study of crimes, the number of crimes committed each month over several years are useful for finding patterns of crime victimization.  Time series analysis attempts to discover from the data how future observations relate to past ones, usually through some elementary functions.  Recent research efforts, however, have demonstrated the disadvantages of imposing simplistic structures on the series.  This research develops flexible new methods to understand the dynamic structure of a much broader class of time series data for which the relationship among observations are nonlinear, infinitely dependent and/or seasonal.  For instance, monthly unemployment rate data usually exhibit seasonal patterns that are best described by a semiparametric seasonal model.  This research enables one to predict future observations based on past information much more accurately. Improved forecasting of foreign exchange, stock and other volatile prices will provide crucial information about the future state of the economy.  New insights into the interaction of various economic indicators could lead to a more informed strategy of economic development.  The tools developed through this research have the potential for analyzing non-economic time series data as well.  For instance, seasonal forecasts of future crime rates may help law enforcement agencies to create a more effective crime prevention plan.",
