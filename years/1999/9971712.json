 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study the effects of polarization mode\r\ndispersion on fiber communication systems. Polarization mode dispersion (PMD)\r\nis caused by random birefringence of optical fibers. As the bit rate per channel\r\nis reaching tens of gigabytes per second, PMD has become a major limiting \r\nfactor on the system performance. The awardee will study the \r\neffects of PMD on both linear and soliton communication systems. In particular, \r\nhe will investigate the probability distribution of the differential group \r\ndelay for various birefringence models as a function of arbitrary fiber length \r\nin a linear transmission system. He also plans to examine the combined \r\neffects of PMD and weak nonlinearity on the statistics of the transmission\r\nspectrum measured through a polarizer at the output of a test fiber. \r\nIn addition, he will assess the effects of PMD on a soliton communication system.\r\nHe will examine the statistics of PMD-induced timing jitter, polarization\r\nfluctuations and dispersive radiation, and estimate limitations imposed by PMD \r\non soliton transmission. These problems are different but inter-related. \r\nThe results of these studies will provide theoretical guidance on various \r\naspects of communication system design. \r\n\r\nThis project studies the effects of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) on fiber \r\ncommunication systems. This is a phenomenon that degrades the performance of \r\noptical fiber communication systems.  It occurs randomly along optical fibers, \r\nchanges with time and is hard to control.  Therefore it is a major limiting factor for the \r\nperformance of optical telecommunication systems. The work will directly address the \r\nrealistic problem of PMD effects on current fiber communication systems\r\nthrough the develoment and analysis of mathematical models and will thus lead to \r\ndesign recommendations and performance bounds for such systems\r\n",
