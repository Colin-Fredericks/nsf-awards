At the core of IME is a\r\nmodel of evolving urban spatial structure already successfully applied\r\nto the Baltimore/Washington and San Francisco metropolitan areas.  This\r\nresearch drastically extends the capabilities of the previous model by\r\nallowing it to be combined with a variety of other models of natural\r\nand social processes affecting the urban realm, by strengthening its\r\ntheoretical and technical base and analytical utility, and by\r\nintegrating it within a portable user-friendly environment for the\r\ninvestigation of a variety of urban research and policy questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIME consists of two levels.  At the IME-1 level the focus is on the\r\nchanging urban spatial structure, as in the earlier model, but now a\r\nmuch more versatile and sophisticated range of urban growth models can\r\nbe built through the linkage with models of other natural and human\r\nurban subsystems.  The IME-2 level is for investigating more general,\r\nnot directly geographic urban research and policy questions, where\r\nurban spatial structure is one of several key factors.  The research\r\nplan consists of four interrelated tasks.  Task One develops the\r\ntheoretical and technical framework for the IME.  Task Two demonstrates\r\nand tests the validity of the approach at the IME-1 level through\r\nmodeling and analyzing the growth patterns of selected metropolitan\r\nregions.  Task Three demonstrates and tests the validity of the\r\napproach at the IME-2 level with a study seeking to predict land use\r\nintensity and population distribution through coupling of several\r\ndifferent models of physical and human processes, including a model of\r\nurban spatial structure.  Task Four focuses on the computational\r\nimplementation and dissemination of the IME.  Dissemination plans\r\ninclude the development of two (one undergraduate and one graduate)\r\nWeb-based courses on urban change.\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe project is multi-institutional, linking together the University of\r\nCalifornia Santa Barbara and two other major federally funded projects:\r\n the Urban Retrospectives/Urban Dynamics initiative at the United\r\nStates Geological Survey will provide the data for the metropolitan\r\nareas and assist with the more routine modeling work.  The Urban\r\nSecurity initiative at the Los Alamos National Laboratory will\r\ncontribute advanced expertise on the theoretical and technical aspects\r\nof complex dynamic models, and on the coupling of physical science\r\nmodels with urban models.  It will also provide access to\r\nsupercomputing resources where needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
