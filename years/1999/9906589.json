The proposal identified the following research projects where efforts will be made to continue involving and retaining more students:\r\nIntelligent Video Coding for Heterogeneous Networks\r\nHigh Performance Special Purpose Computer System\r\nTeleoperation over Heterogeneous Networks\r\n\r\nWhile increasing the participation of women and minorities in graduate education, the project will facilitate, enhance, and intensify research in CISE areas.  Through this effort, NCAT is expected to develop further its computer engineering research capabilities involving minority students in greater numbers, paving the way for the conferring of more doctoral degrees to under-represented groups, particularly African Americans and women in Computer Information Science and Engineering.  It is hoped that through these efforts, the nation might find a successful model that will help in building a better racially and ethnically balanced technological enterprise for the benefit of its present and future generations.\r\n\r\n",
