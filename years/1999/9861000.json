This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Visible Productions, LLC will focus on extending the technologies of a prototype system, which provide students with an opportunity to perform digital dissections, and on determining the feasibility of a robust Java-based implementation sufficient to support commercial scale use.  The implementation will consist of a Java client application tightly integrated into a Web-based interface to the image request server.  The integration of the Web interface and image server will allow for convenient image caching, retrieval, and management.  This architecture will provide a seamless interface, invisible to the user, between local computation and remote image generation.  In addition to offering a platform independent solution, the implementation of the client application in Java will be crucial to achieving this integration.  The project will involve research into several areas not addressed by the prototype system.  Specifically, performance of improvement of the digital staining algorithm required for Java implementation; management of local segmentation documents and transparent transmittal with imaging request to the server; Web-based user interface allowing students private, authenticated access to and management of the images produced from their requests; and beta testing with a small group of students.\r\n     This project proffers a pedagogically sound approach in the area of anatomy, which will combine laboratory computers with a high-end system through the Internet in such a way, that students can use this platform without requiring the institution to acquire high-end technology. \r\n",
