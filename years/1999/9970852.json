The first concerns risk-sensitive \r\nstochastic control on an infinite time horizon, with applications in \r\nfinance.  Investment control policies are sought which maximize \r\nthe long term growth rate of expected utility of an investor's \r\nwealth.  Infinite horizon robust control problems are considered as \r\ndeterministic, small noise intensity limits of risk sensitive \r\nproblems.  The second part concerns macroeconomic growth/debt \r\nmodels for developing economies in which interest and production \r\nrates are modelled stochastically.  In the models to be considered, \r\ncapital investment and consumption are being controlled.  Among \r\nthe modelling issues to be addressed are appropriate limitations on \r\nborrowing through either hard constraints or penalty functions.\r\n\r\nThis project concerns optimal stochastic control techniques for \r\nproblems of finance.  One area of application concerns investment \r\nportfolio optimization over long time horizons.  The goal is to \r\nsuggest investment control policies that provide good growth of an \r\ninvestor's wealth.  This is done by optimizing some risk-sensitive \r\nperformance criterion.  Another area of application is to \r\ninternational finance and debt.  Recent crises, especially in Asia, \r\nhave led to questions concerning the causes, how crises can be \r\nprevented and possible early warning signs of vulnerability.  The \r\ngoal of this research is to develop and analyze stochastic control \r\nmodels for the growth of developing economies in which interest \r\nand production rates are modelled stochastically.  The model \r\nperformance under optimal control policies may provide \r\nbenchmarks to indicate whether actual current account deficits and \r\nforeign debt are sustainable under current policies.\r\n",
