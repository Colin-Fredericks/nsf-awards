Gruner of the Department  of Physics of the University of California at Los Angeles  will investigate the behavior of some heavy fermion compounds and organic  conductors in the millimeter and microwave  regions of  the  spectrum  under  varying conditions  of  frequency, temperature  and  magnetic  field.   The  purpose  of  these studies  is  to  investigate the possible breakdown  of  the Landau  theory  of fermi liquids.  Previous  experiments  on uranium platinate  gave  results  that  suggest   that   a systematic  search for such breakdown would be  appropriate. This  topic  is of high current interest and stands  at  the forefront  of contemporary research in solid state  physics. The Landau theory has been very successful in describing the behavior  of  metals  but  it  may  not  apply  to systems characterized\tby   strongly  correlated  electron-electron interactions.  These are believed to active in systems  that exhibit\t high-temperature   superconductivity,    colossal magnetoresistance,  and  others.   The  objectives  of\tthe\r\nresearch  are therefore:  to test the validity of the  Fermi liquid  theory  of  the metallic state  with  heavy  fermion metals;  to determine the nature of the correlation  gap  in heavy  fermion  insulators; to explore the  various  quantum states  in quasi one-dimensional metals; and to examine  the Mott-Luttinger  gap  in these insulators.   The  experiments will  be  done  on  the  heavy fermion compounds  CeAl3  and CeRu2Si2,  and others.  Also, experiments will be  performed on  linear  chain  metal compounds, the so-called  Bechgaard salts, to explore the anisotropic electrodynamics.  Here the reason  for  these experiments is the recognition  that  for strictly   one-dimensional  metals  with   electron-electron interactions, the ground state is not that of a Fermi liquid and  that a magnetic field can change the dimensionality  of the  system.  The experiments will be performed with high  Q resonant  structures in which the samples form part  of  the structure.\r\n%%%\r\nThis  research will investigate the behavior of  some  heavy fermion  compounds and organic conductors.

An important  feature  of the  program  is the integration of research  and  education through training of graduate students in a fundamentally and technologically important area.\r\n***\r\n",
