 "awd_abstract_narration": "For groups to make high quality decisions members must have some proficiency at evaluating individual contributions to the discussion.  Recent research indicates that groups have some proficiency at making these assessments even on highly uncertain estimation tasks.  Subsequent investigation have demonstrated that groups can bec ome better at this with the assistance of strategic guidance or feedback.  These findings suggest the interaction cues and strategies that groups use when reaching consenus have some degree of validity.  While a few studies have investigated how groups can become better at evaluating member competence, no research has explored what cues and strategies are actually being relied on to make these assessments.  The purpose of the proposed research is to investigate the group judgment process by developing and validating an observational coding system for identifying that cues and strategies used during group interaction.  Results will shed light on the nature of the group judgment process and will help guide the design of group training interventions.  In the long term, this research program is intended to advance our knowledge of group decision making across a wide variety of experimental and applied contexts.",
