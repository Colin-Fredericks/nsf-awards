 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860838\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the use of redox polymer electrodes for the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide through electrochemical regeneration of redox catalyst.  Hydrogen peroxide is a clean oxidant with water as its reaction product.  It is therefore environmentally acceptable in many industries.  The market for peroxide in North America is expected to grow by 10% over the next five years.  The existing plants are operating to their full capacity and new plants are needed to meet future demand.  New technology using aqueous system that can replace the commercial anthraquinone process (using non-aqueous solvents) is desirable for the expansion.  This project involves the use of redox polymer catalysts for synthesis of hydrogen peroxide in a single reaction step through combined electrochemical and chemical reactions.  The Phase I proposal work includes preparation of a stable redox polymer catalyst for the production of hydrogen peroxide from oxygen or air and water.  Redox polymers will be characterized using IR and electrochemical techniques (voltammetry, rotating disc experiments).  A laboratory cell of simple design will be operated in the Phase I to demonstrate the process and measure peroxide production efficiencies.\r\n     The existing plants are operating to their full capacity and new plants are needed to meet future demand for production of peroxide.  New technology using aqueous system that can replace the commercial anthraquinone process (using non-aqueous solvents) is desirable for the expansion.  The outcome of the Phase I research would result in new process for both on site and central manufacturing facility.\r\n",
