 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860173\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has the goal of producing a 10W Non-Planar Ring Oscillator, similar in concept to the company's highly successful Lightwave Series 126, but borrowing ideas normally associated with lasers >1OW. LIGO interferometers rely on state-of-the-art single frequency lasers. The company has produced such lasers for these applications.  However, major simplifications can be made in the design, while improving performance. These new designs will be investigated.  The result of this research is expected to have long-lasting benefits, as various non-linear optical devices will be enabled through the technique of external resonantly-enhanced processes. This includes CW Optical Parametric Oscillators and CW second, third and fourth harmonic generation. The new design concepts proposed here reduces the size, cost and complexity of a 1OW LIGO-capable laser by a full order of magnitude. This factor of ten reduction is critical for commercial success of this useful technology.\r\n     Through non-linear generation of the output of the laser described here, a variety of applications, currently served by ion lasers, can adopt the much more favorable solid-state technology. These include laser projection display, stereo-lithography, and reprographics.\r\n",
