 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vodacek    Research will be undertaken in response to an Announcement of Opportunity (NSF 97-38) for   Coastal Studies in the Great Lakes.  This is a collaborative research project involving eleven    investigators from five academic research institutions.  The research is being conducted under the   auspices of the NSF Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) program and the NOAA Coastal Ocean   Program.  This collaborative, interdisciplinary 5-year research program will entail an integrated   program of field and laboratory studies and mathematical modeling to quantify the role of coastal   currents and thermal fronts in mediating cross-margin transport in Lake Superior.      The western shore of Lake Superior's Keweenaw Peninsula exhibits a dramatic coastal jet known   as the Keweenaw Current.  A strong, shore-parallel density front, the thermal bar, also is   characteristic of this region and persists long into the summer. The goal of the proposed work is to   determine the physical, chemical, and biological effects that arise from the intense physical forcing   on this system, and specifically, to elucidate how these effects interact temporally and spatially to   define distinct nearshore and offshore environments in Lake Superior.  This project represents the   first effort to model coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes in the coastal zone of   Lake Superior where both vertical and horizontal thermal structure and transport processes are   important.    The research team is divided into three subgroups: Physical Processes, Chemical Gradients, and   Biological Communities.  The Physical Processes group will examine the relative importance of all   forcing factors (e.g., wind-driven variability, baroclinic instability) that govern cross margin   transport using in situ observations, numerical modeling, and satellite observations.  The Chemical   Gradients group will characterize nearshore-offshore differences in distributions of chemical   species, evaluate chemical tracers of  water and sediment movement, and investigate differences   (inshore vs. offshore) in chemical cycles induced by the current.  The Biological Communities   group will determine how gradients in primary production, trophic structure, and rates of material   transformation develop. All three groups will interact closely throughout the project to obtain and   share complementary data sets and to derive a coupled physical/chemical/biological model of the   system.  The detailed, process-level understanding achieved by this project will advance our   quantitative understanding of the processes that regulate the transport, transformation and fate of   biologically, chemically and geologically important matter in coastal regions and provide a firm   basis for future management decisions on how best to preserve the pristine nature of Lake   Superior.        This particular project will contribute to the activities of the Physical Processes subgroup that will   measure  currents, thermal, and density structure in order to define the spatial and temporal extent   of the Keweenaw Current and thermal bar. After suitable algorithm development, satellite imagery will be used to track the transport of organic matter.",
