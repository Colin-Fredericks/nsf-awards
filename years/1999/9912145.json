 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Izmit, Turkey earthquake has resulted in significant loss of life, injuries to thousands, destruction of thousands of buildings and subsequent displacement of hundreds of thousands of people.  Lifeline systems have been damaged, causing disruption to infrastructure service delivery systems.  This earthquake holds many lessons for the U.S., and there is much to gain from studying the event.  The Anatolian Fault system is very similar to the San Andreas and Hayward systems in the San Francisco Bay area, and an earthquake of similar magnitude striking there would result in many of the same challenges.\r\n\r\nThis award is to support a workshop activity to be coordinated by the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI).  Through this workshop, the U.S. research community will be able to establish ties to counterparts in the scientific, engineering, planning, and policy communities in Turkey, and develop a plan to capture the lessons before perishable data are lost.  EERI has coordinated field visits to Turkey during August and September 1999, and early field reports point to dramatic geologic and geotechnical impacts including surface faulting and dramatic ground displacement and subsidence.  Structural engineers report on the poor performance of thousands of non-ductile concrete buildings, and the media has widely reported on the numerous challenges to emergency response that have developed.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will be convened to develop an integrated agenda of collaborative research and database resources, identifying topics that show the greatest promise for access and to advance the state of knowledge and practice in the U.S.",
