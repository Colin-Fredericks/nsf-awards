 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the late nineteenth century, the United States imposed high protective tariffs on imported manufactured goods. This period also saw the rapid industrialization of the United States, including a sharp shift in its trade structure, as it became a net exporter of manufactured goods for the first time in its history.\r\n\r\nThis period in U.S. economic history has recently become the source of controversy. Some current advocates of protectionism have sought to justify their position, in part, by arguing that the late nineteenth century U.S. experience demonstrates that high tariffs proved beneficial before and therefore should be considered again. Surprisingly, economists and economic historians have had little to say about the interaction between trade policy and industrialization and the factors accounting for the shift in U.S. trade position in manufactures.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to deepen our understanding of U.S. trade and trade policy during the pivotal period of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The research, which will be a part of the National Bureau of Economic Research's programs on the Development of the American Economy and International Trade and Investment, will address three main issues.\r\n\r\nThe first issue is the relationship between tariffs and the growth of infant industries.  The research will focus on evaluating the role of tariffs in promoting the tinplate industry, which has often been referred to as the best example of a successful infant industry policy during this period.  The approach will be to examine the counter factual question of whether and when the industry would have developed in the absence of tariff protection. This question is rarely posed or answered, yet it is key to determining the effects of infant industry protection.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is the political economy of the tariff. While there have been several studies that examine the economic and political factors behind specific tariff legislation during this period, the focus here will be on trying to evaluate the trade policy preferences of the mass electorate.  The presidential election of 1888, which is generally believed to have hinged on the tariff issue, will be studied. The two main political parties nominated candidates that had deeply opposing views on tariff policy. Cross-state or -county voting for the parties can be related to the economic and social characteristics of those states and counties and thus potentially reveal information on what accounts for the variation in the degree of support for higher or lower tariffs.\r\n\r\nThe third issue is the sharp change in U.S. comparative advantage in the mid-1890s that enabled the United States to become a net exporter of manufactured goods. Trade economists generally focus on changes in technology and factor endowments as altering trade flows. Neither productivity advances nor capital accumulation appear to account for the timing of the abrupt shift in U.S. comparative advantage toward manufactures around 1895. This research will focus on iron and steel exports, which were the main driving factor behind the U.S. manufactured export surge, and highlight the role of resource endowments (specifically, iron ore prices as a result of the Mesabi discoveries).  A simultaneous three-equation system that includes U.S. and U.K. production costs and foreign demand in a third market (Canada) will be developed to disentangle the various supply and demand factors at work in stimulating U.S. exports.\r\n",
