Song birds learn their songs in the first few months of life by imitating the songs of adult birds.  Song learning often leads to the formation of regional dialects, much as in human speech, which is also learned early in life.  It has been suggested that if both males and females learn their songs and then chose mates based on song, then gene flow between dialects will be restricted.  Nelson and Parker will study the song dialects of the Puget Sound white-crowned sparrow along\r\nThe northwest coast of North America.  A series of song playback experiments will be used to define dialect boundaries that are perceptually meaningful to the birds.  The researchers will then compare genetic variation between dialects using genetic markers produced from tiny blood samples taken from birds.  The genotypic data will also be used to follow dispersal of birds relative to dialect boundaries.  \r\n\r\nSince song dialects are one of the few examples of long-lasting culturally-transmitted traditions known in animals, they provide a useful model system for study of the vocal learning process, and how learned vocalizations (culture) may affect the genetic structure of animal populations.  This project will provide basic information on these issues, which may ultimately prove useful in understanding similar processes in humans.\r\n",
