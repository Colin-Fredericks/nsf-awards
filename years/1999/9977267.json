 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative research proposal being submitted by the University of Texas at Austin\r\n(PI: Simon S. Lam) and the University of Kentucky (PI: Kenneth Calvert).\r\nMost Internet applications are based upon the client-server paradigm and make use of unicast\r\ndelivery of data sent as independent packets.  The technical issues of securing unicast communi-\r\ncations for client-server computing are fairly well understood.  However, many emerging Internet\r\napplications are based upon a group communications model.  In particular, they require packet\r\ndelivery from one or more authorized senders to a large number of authorized receivers.  Further-\r\nmore, the data of many of these applications should be viewed as flows rather than as independent\r\npackets.  Conceptually, since every point-to-multipoint communication can be represented as a set\r\nof point-to-point communications, and every flow can be treated as a sequence of individual pack-\r\nets, the current technology base for securing unicast packets can be extended in a straightforward\r\nmanner to securing applications that employ flows and multicasts. Such extensions, however, would\r\nbe highly inefficient.  They will not be applicable to high-speed transmission and delay-sensitive\r\nows, nor scalable to large groups.\r\nThe objectives of this proposal are to investigate architectures and protocols for securing mul-\r\nticast and flow applications with emphasis on efficiency, latency, and scalability.  The researchers have obtained some preliminary results on scalable group key management and efficient digital signatures. These\r\nare essential ingredients for designing and implementing secure multicast services.  However, to de-\r\nsign a scalable service for secure multicast on the Internet, even with just best-effort delivery, several\r\nresearch issues remain, namely, performance comparison of alternative architectures, efficient and\r\nreliable delivery of rekey messages (and their impact on a wide area network), and deployment of\r\ntrusted components and active agents.\r\nThe researchers next propose to investigate the more difficult problem of reliable secure multicast.  For the\r\nInternet, this problem has been largely unexplored.  Initially, the researchers plan to approach this problem\r\nfrom two directions, namely, (i) how to make reliable multicast secure, and (ii) how to make secure\r\nmulticast reliable. In addressing this problem, their concerns are, first, correctness, and second,\r\nperformance issues such as latency and scalability.\r\nThere are many applications that can benefit from techniques and services for securing flows\r\nand multicasts, e.g., teleconference, pay per view, informaton services, virtual private networks,\r\ncollaborative work, software distribution, etc. The researchers propose to experiment with some of these applications.  In particular, they propose to investigate a less obvious application, namely, active networks,\r\nwhich raises some interesting research issues.  Securing active networks is an important problem\r\nwith many different concerns, some of which are being addressed by other researchers.  In the pro-\r\nposed project, the researchers are primarily concerned with characterizing the authenticity and confidentiality requirements of mobile code distribution in active networks and ensuring their satisfaction using efficient methods.\r\n",
