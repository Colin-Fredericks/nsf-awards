Within the past decade or so, the oxide superconductors, ruthenates, manganates, fullerenes and heavy electron materials have attracted attention.  Of fundamental interest are those properties that reflect quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale.  Such discoveries are challenging us continuously to extend our understanding of properties of matter.  New, inherently quantum phases of matter, such as quantum Hall states are discovered, as are new concepts, such as quantum phase transitions at the absolute zero of temperature between fundamentally distinct states of matter driven entirely by quantum mechanics.  Control over properties of quantum states of matter remains an engaging intellectual enterprise.  We are beginning to realize that underlying the materials science, there must be a set of physical principles, most likely simple in character; however, to discover these principles a genuine shift in thinking is needed.  The long-cherished ideas that have served us well for conventional materials have to be abandoned.  One can no longer think in terms of physics on single length and  energy scales, because the effects are entirely collective.  In contrast to high energy physics, the microscopic Hamiltonian is known with certainty, but the states of matter comprise unfathomable richness and complexity.  Thus, all such phenomena, by defintion, must be collective.  It appears that even the basic notion of an electron as a particle embedded in matter has to be revised because such a particle may not retain its integrity but break up into many, which is the notion of fractionalization of charge and spin.  The thrust of this research is this forward-looking view.  The chosen research topics relate directly to the phenomena reflecting the unusual nature of quantum mechanics.  Quantum phase transitions where matter is transformed from a metal to an insulator, or from a superconductor to an insulator is addressed.  Despite a long histroy these problems are unresolved in any deep sense of the word; proof of which can be found in the regular appearance of unexpected discoveries.  The theoretical difficulty is that we do not have the mathematical tools to treat strongly interacting degrees of freedom in matter.  An aspect of this grant consists of developing such tools from the perspective of field theory, as applied to the theory of matter.  In yet another direction, the grant concerns the development of a notion of superconductivity in which pairing results from the saving of the electronic kinetic energy of the normal state.  This is unabashedly unconventional because there is no notion of exchanging a quantum of excitation to mediate attraction between electrons resulting in superconductivity.\r\n%%%  \r\nQuantum mechanical properties of materials continue to produce novel and unexpected phenomena.
