 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop innovative techniques and software for so-called\r\n\"fast methods\" for n-body solvers and their applications.  An n-body solver\r\ncomputes the behavior of a set of interacting particles; examples run from\r\nthe solar system (9 planets interacting through gravity) to computer chips\r\n(billions of atoms that attract or repel electrons).  \"Fast\" methods for\r\nthese solvers use data structures such as trees to minimize the number of\r\ncomputations.  Typically, the data structure summarizes the interactions of\r\na group of particles, eliminating the need to compute all of the pairwise\r\ninteractions.  Managing the data structure makes these methods difficult to\r\nprogram, particularly on modern parallel machines.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses algorithmic issues, serial and parallel performance,\r\nportability, and I/O requirements for fast methods for particle dynamics in\r\nselected applications. Specifically, the project makes research\r\ncontributions in the following areas:\r\n\r\n* Error Control  and Boundary Conditions: This project will extend recent\r\nwork in variable degree multipoles to improve error bounds in non-uniform\r\nparticle distributions while minimizing the added computation.\r\n\r\n* Robust Parallel Algorithms and Libraries: This project will build\r\ncalibrated portable libraries of fast solvers capable of adapting to\r\ndynamic computational platforms like clusters of multiprocessors.\r\n\r\n* Data Analysis and I/O  Control: This project will investigate compression\r\nschemes capable of effectively handling the huge amounts of data generated\r\nby particle dynamics simulations.\r\n\r\nThe education plan includes a variety of initiatives at various levels. The\r\nComputer Applications in K-12 Education in Science (CAKE) program will\r\nintroduce pre-college students to the use of high performance computing and\r\nnetworking, using GUIs based on the research libraries as teaching tools.\r\nA series of courses, seminars, and workshops on parallel computing and its\r\napplications will extend the education to the undergraduate and graduate\r\nlevels at Purdue University.\r\n\r\n",
