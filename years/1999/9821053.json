 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the design and analysis of simple and efficient algorithms for a number of basic problems arising in parallel and distributed computing.  Problems related to caching, scheduling and sorting are considered.\r\n\r\nEfficient caching strategies are critical to the performance of virtually any computing system, be it sequential, parallel, or distributed.  As a consequence, such strategies have been intensively studied for decades.  Unfortunately, the time-tested techniques that successfully optimize cache performance in many existing systems do not seem to scale well to complex wide-area networks such as the Internet.  Two major goals of this project are to develop suitable abstract models of such complex networks, and to design simple and efficient caching strategies for these abstract models.\r\n\r\nEfficient scheduling of dynamically generated tasks is a central problem in parallel computing.  Scheduling determines when and where to execute each task and can dramatically affect performance.  Traditionally, such scheduling decisions are left to the programmer, an approach that allows for the possibility of optimal performance, but makes parallel programming difficult.  The work-stealing algorithm is a simple and provably efficient \"automatic\" task-scheduling method.  However, the practical utility of such a scheduler depends critically on the amount of overhead that it incurs.  This project explores methods for improving the performance of distributed data structures as the concurrent deque used in the work-stealing algorithm.\r\n\r\nTwo sorting-related problems are addressed in this project.  The first is concerned with the analysis of a simple periodic scheme for sorting on a two-dimensional mesh.  The scheme is well-suited for VLSI implementation and is conjectured to achieve optimal average-case performance.  The second sorting-related problem is concerned with the analysis of a simple randomized n-imput circuit that is conjectured to map the inputs to the outputs according to a near-uniform random permutation.  Such a circuit has a number of applications in cryptography and in the design of efficient routing networks.\r\n\r\n",
