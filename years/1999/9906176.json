 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tTeaching SMART, a program of Girls Incorporated of Rapid City (South Dakota), a division of Youth & Family Services, is an equity-based, comprehensive three-year teacher professional development program designed to produce systemic change in the classroom by improving science education at the elementary school level.  The mission of Teaching SMART is to encourage the performance and persistence of all students, particularly girls and minority youth, in elementary science.  To achieve this end, Teaching SMART provides instruction and hands-on training for third through fifth grade teachers which increase their awareness of and comfort level in using equitable, hands-on, inquiry, and exploration based approaches to teaching science.  The success of the program is based on its long-term commitment to educational reform, which can only be accomplished through a comprehensive professional development training model such as Teaching SMART.  \r\n\tThe Teaching SMART National Teacher Training and Technical Assistance Program seeks to replicate the Teaching SMART program in five diverse urban and rural school districts across the nation:  Greater Atlanta, Georgia; New Orleans, Louisiana; Bay City, Michigan; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Fairmont, West Virginia.\r\n",
