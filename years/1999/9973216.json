 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Christopher Magri  AST 9973216\r\n\r\nThis observational program will make use of the newly upgraded radar system at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico to study carbonaceous mainbelt asteroids (MBAs). Carbonaceous asteroids are thought to be relatively unaltered from the primordial solids that condensed in the outer solar nebula.  The outermost asteroids probably have complex organic molecules on their surfaces.  The radar-derived data will be used to set constraints on target shape, topography, rotation state, composition, and near-surface roughness to define similarities and differences between the various taxonomic classes containing dark objects and between carbonaceous MBAs and other asteroids. The project is a logical outgrowth of recent statistical analysis of all MBAs detected by radar prior to the Arecibo upgrade. Many asteroid targets will be detected at moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using Doppler-only (continuous wave) techniques. These first-time detections will be used to build up data samples within each of the carbonaceous taxonomic classes. A smaller number of targets will produce echoes with high enough SNR that time-resolved signals can profitably be utilized. The \"delay-Doppler\" images that result from binning the echo, both by arrival time and by frequency, will be used as the input to shape-modeling analyses. The analyses will yield constraints on the target's pole-on silhouette for datasets with SNR approaching 100, and can also involve three-dimensional shape reconstruction for SNR values of several hundreds.  The software tools to be used will include both commercial packages and radar-specific programs developed by a research group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \r\n\r\n",
