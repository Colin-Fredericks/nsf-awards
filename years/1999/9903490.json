 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal involves several problems in complex hyperbolic geometry.  The first problem involves  an\r\nalternate proof of a discreteness result for complex hyperbolic ideal triangle groups which was recently\r\nproved by Richard Schwartz after being conjectured by Goldman/Parker.  The proposed proof uses estimates of exponential sums which arise from certain trace identities.  The geometric interpretation of these\r\nestimates should become apparent from Schwartz's computer software for visualizing the boundary of complex hyperbolic 2-space.  Such a proof might lead to a new approach for attacking other discreteness problems.\r\n\r\nThe other proposed problems are related and use an approach involving hermitian matrices which has been utilized in several recent papers written by the PI and Jeff Hakim.  The first of these problems is to find algebraic invariants which characterize the holomorphic isometry classes of m-tuples of points in hyperbolic n-space  by generalizing the approach already implemented to establish the critical case of\r\nm= n+1.   The algebraic invariants may then be used to show that the holomorphic isometry classes\r\nmay also be characterized by the various side lengths, together with additional geometric invariants.  Such a geometric description would provide a convenient coordinate system for studying the theory of linkages in (real or complex)hyperbolic space.  A possible application to discrete subgroups of U(n,1) is the\r\ncharacterization of the finite configurations of the bisectors which bound Dirichlet fundamental domains.  Applying our methods over finite fields, one can count both the size and number of the isometry classes.  This\r\nshould yield interesting functions of n and the characteristic p which may have unanticipated combinatorial properties.  The latter properties could reveal new structure which also occurs over infinite fields.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is to be carried out at the University of Maryland.  This POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
