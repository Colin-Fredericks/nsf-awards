 "awd_abstract_narration": "People vary:  Some people are tall, others are short.  Sometimes this variability comes in clusters.  For example, most people are right handed, fewer are left handed, but there are shades of ambidextrousness in between.  These are observable features of people, but unobservable features of people are likely of a similar character.  For instance, thought processes are unobserved, but different people may use different thinking strategies to solve the same problem.  But how many different thought strategies might be expected, what proportion of the people use which strategies, and which strategies seem the best?  Such questions might seem impossible to answer, but they can often be answered using statistical ideas.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to develop statistical solutions with plausible assumptions regarding the unobservable processes of focus.  Such procedures have many potential applications.  One is to identify different kinds of thought processes as a prelude to helping children develop more adequate ones.  Similarly, it is important to understand what changes in thought take place and when they occur.  Another is to identify early on those children who have advanced thinking processes which might otherwise go unrecognized.  In this research, statistical methods are developed to test for the presence of multiple strategies, assess the number of such strategies people have available, and estimate the probability that an individual employs a particular strategy when confronted with certain thinking tasks.",
