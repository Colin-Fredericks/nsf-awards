 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two main thrusts: 1) forming a collaborative with school districts, centered on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) course work and research for the purpose of recruiting and training science teachers; and 2) bringing TEM into high school and undergraduate science curricula. The project is being adapted for use with a TEM facility from the K-12 microscopy collaborative project at CSU-Hayward called MAGIC (microscopy and graphic imaging center) which focuses on the use of the  SEM.  The project is forming  a professional collaboration between Humboldt State University and local school districts.  During the summer, science teachers learn TEM in a course in which they are paired with university students who are interested in science teaching, and high school students from their classes. The groups include teachers and students from Native American communities in our area.  After the summer experience with TEM, the university students join the science teachers and high school students in their classrooms. The university students assist with instructional delivery of cell biology topics, an introduction to TEM, and field trips to the university to see the TEM facility in operation as well as other campus science labs. This experience begins the process of recruiting and training future science teachers, and may eventually lead to a science student teaching placement in the classroom of the teacher with whom the university student was paired. It is expected that university students enter student teaching with a greater knowledge of the profession than they do currently. High school students also learn about science teaching as a career, science careers in general, and how one pursues these careers. Local science teachers receive invaluable professional growth, and become an integral part of a professional collaborative for recruiting and training future members of their profession.  This project also brings TEM into high school biology and lower-division biology classes at the university level, involves upper-division students directly in the development of TEM materials for instructional use in a variety of biology courses, and provides an arena for research by high school students, university students, high school teachers, and university faculty.",
