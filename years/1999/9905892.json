This competition is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the automotive industry in support of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) program.  It has the goal of designing and competing commercially producible automobiles that are simultaneously comfortable, safe, roadable, commercially viable, and highly fuel-efficient.  The goal of the PNGV program is the development of technologies that will enable cars that have a fuel efficiency of 80 miles per gallon.  Under the FutureCar Competition, a number of universities compete annually in this event.  This award provides funding to support the competition and to offset costs for expenses such as team prizes, communication and safety equipment rentals and other competition expenses.",
