The US co-organizer is Dr. Keith Pennypacker of the University of South Florida and the Polish co-organizer is Dr. Leszek Kaczmarek of the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.   Recent research has indicated that a handful of transcription factors may exert dramatic influence on brain physiology and pathology.  An understanding of this influence and dissecting it into specific components is the major challenge at present as it should lead to advancing our knowledge of signal transduction in the brain.  This workshop will bring together a group of specialists from various countries to present their recent results and to discuss their implication for approaching this challenging scientific question.\r\n\r\nThis neuroscience workshop fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\r\n",
