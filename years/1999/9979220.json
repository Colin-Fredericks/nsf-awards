 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AAAS Project on Science, Technology and Disability proposes to initiate within the National Science Foundation (NSF) its highly successful project, ENTRY POINT!  ENTRY POINT! is a national effort to discover and develop talent among students with disabilities and place them in paid summer internships.  The program seeks out students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, science education, mathematics, all fields of engineering, and engineering technology.  The long-term goal of the project is to increase the diversity of the Nation's science and engineering work force.\r\n     AAAS will provide orientation activities and materials for the interns to assist them in quickly learning about NSF needs and operations.  These will include orientation packets for student interns before they begin their summer internships.  Information on disability accommodations will also be provided to managers and co-workers.  Site visits will be made to each intern during the summer, and follow-up interviews will be conducted in the fall.\r\n     AAAS has extensive experience in identifying students with disabilities at postsecondary institutions across the country facilitating a broad and deep recruitment effort for identifying highly qualified undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities pursuing science and engineering disciplines.  AAAS will screen the students as candidates for paid 10-week summer internships.  NSF will provide interns with meaningful job assignments, building their skills and complementing their academic studies, and assign mentors to the students.  The project will provide stipends, worksite accommodations as needed, and limited travel funds to those who relocate.\r\n     Prior to, during, and after the summer internships, AAAS will maintain regular contact with the students, advising them on academic and employment issues, and connecting them with users and developers of assistive technology.\r\n",
