 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research investigation is to compare the impact of institutional arrangements vs. broad socio-economic and demographic factors on resource conditions, and to examine whether different types of institutional regimes lead systematically to different resource related outcomes.  Property rights are the form of institutional arrangements that will be the focus of research.  Forests constitute the resource type to be studies.  \r\nThe research is carried out in the Kumaon region of the Indian Middle Himalaya where nearly 5000 village-level community forests exist side by side with privately held forests and other forests managed by the Revenue and Forest Departments of the Indian government.  The investigator selects 100 cases and, in each case, four different forms of tenure over forests exist.  The existence of different tenurial forms in the same region provides an ideal setting in which to examine l) the effect of pro0perty rights in comparison to other factors that are often asserted to influence the condition of resources (the research pays specific attention to population, migration, market, and cultural perceptions about resources), and 2) the different impact of variations in property regimes on forest condition, and 3) the importance of different monitoring and enforcement mechanisms in the effectiveness of property rights regimes. \r\nThe data set constructed and analyzed through the research complements an earlier data set created by the investigator through research in the Kumaon region to study intensively forest management institutions in 24 villages.  The existing data was collected using a stet of ten questionnaires that allow researchers to relate resource condition to biological, climatic and edaphic, socio-economic, demographic, and institutional variables.\r\nBy locating and identifying the processes and precise means whereby institutional arrangements influence resource management and conditions, the research lends greater specificity to attempted policies on the subject.  In addition, few studies have undertaken a comparative examination either of the relative importance of property rights in comparison to larger socio-economic or climatic variables, or of the variable influence of different property regimes.  Thus, this research enhances significantly our understanding of the topic.\r\n\r\n",
