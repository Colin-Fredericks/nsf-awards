 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses a combination of experimental and computational approaches to study the mechanisms of gas phase organic reactions.  the gas phase work provides information on the intrinsic reactivity of species in the absence of solvation.  Comparision with condensed-phase data will give insight into the effects of solvation and ion-pairing on the mechanism.  Using a substrate in which one ion undergoes a chemical reaction while another remains intact, mass spectrophotometric data will be obtained for characterization of the reaction product.   In this way, gas phase substitution and elimination reactions will be studied.\r\n\r\nWith this Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Scott Gronert of San Francisco State University.  Professor Gronert's research explores the outcomes of chemical reactions in the gas phase, in the absence of solvent molecules.  In this way, it may be possible to more fully understand the fundamental nature of these reaction and, by comparison with the same reactions carried out in solvent, conclusions may be reached with regard to the role of solvent molecules in mediating chemical reactions.\r\n",
