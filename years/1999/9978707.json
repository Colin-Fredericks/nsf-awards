 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDamage to concrete structures is caused by overloading, fatigue damage,\r\nthermal damage, or a combination of these and other factors. The repair of\r\ndamaged concrete structures costs federal, state, and local governments\r\nbillions of dollars annually. Quantitative assessment of damage using\r\nnondestructive methods is essential for determining the structural\r\nintegrity of structures and for predicting the remaining usable life. The\r\nproposed research will address these needs through the study of ultrasound\r\npropagation in concrete at frequencies higher than those typically used for\r\nconcrete inspection. The combined experimental and theoretical study will\r\nprovide insight into the propagation, scattering, and dissipation of\r\nultrasound. The influence of overloading, fatigue damage, thermal damage,\r\nand structural reinforcement on diffuse ultrasound propagation will also be\r\ninvestigated. The proposed high frequency (> 100 kHz) approach will improve\r\nthe detection of smallscale damage by using wavelengths that are shorter\r\nthan those most widely used. The objectives of the proposed research during\r\nthe threeyear period are to:\r\n\r\n(1) Develop a model describing the propagation, scattering, and dissipation\r\nof ultrasound through both undamaged and damaged concrete,\r\n(2) Corroborate the developed model experimentally, and\r\n(3) Examine the effects of overload damage, mechanical fatigue damage, and\r\nthermal cycling damage on diffuse ultrasound propagation.\r\n\r\nObjectives (1) and (2) will be achieved using analysis techniques already\r\ndeveloped to describe wave propagation through heterogeneous media. Similar\r\ndiffuse-field techniques have been particularly successful for\r\ncharacterizing polycrystalline microstructures and geophysical media.\r\nConcrete inspection research has not yet benefited from these new\r\ntechniques. Objectives (2) and (3) will be achieved using both contact\r\ntransducer techniques and ultrasonic immersion tank methods which have been\r\ndeveloped for the study of diffuse ultrasound propagation.\r\n\r\nThe scientific merit of the proposed research lies in: (i) the statistical\r\nwave propagation approach used, (ii) the highfrequency diffuse ultrasonic\r\nmethods employed, and (iii) the combination of theoretical and experimental\r\nresearch which will provide experimental corroboration of the developed\r\ntheories. It is anticipated that the research will lead to new techniques\r\nfor assessing damage in concrete structures. The proposed research also\r\nwill have significant impact on the educational training of graduate and\r\nundergraduate students in nondestructive evaluation techniques applied to\r\nessential infrastructure materials.",
