 "awd_abstract_narration": "9970943\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious probability problems will be studied.  The principal ones deal with systems of weakly interacting random walks and with rho-percolation.  In the random walk systems one starts with one particle at each site of the integer lattice in d dimensions and lets each particle perform a continuous time random walk on this lattice.  Interactions occur only when a particle jumps to a site which is itself occupied or is adjacent to an occupied site.  In this case the particle which just jumped may coalesce with one of the particles at or adjacent to the site to which it jumped.  In another version the particle which just jumped may annihilate another particle.  The asymptotic density of such systems will be investigated.  Rho-percolation has the same set-up as ordinary site percolation.  The sites of a lattice are independently chosen to be occupied or vacant with probability p or 1-p, respectively.  One says that rho-percolation occurs if there exists an infinite self-avoiding path on the lattice whose lower density of occupied sites is at least rho.  The proposer intends to investigate analogues of various power bounds which are already known or conjectured for ordinary percolation.\r\n\r\nThis research will study problems about systems of particles which undergo random motion and which have an interaction which removes particles from the system when two particles come close to each other.  One motivation for studying such systems is that they can be viewed as crude models for certain chemical reactions.  It is hoped that the variants of the model proposed for investigation here are somewhat more realistic than the models usually considered.  Another, unrelated, class of problems in the proposal considers a system which undergoes a phase transition.  Almost all materials have phase transitions at some temperature or magnetic field.  Even though a great deal is known in statistical physics on the non rigorous level about phase transitions, they are still only poorly understood on a mathematical level.  It is hoped that interesting and instructive calculations can be carried out for the relatively new model of rho-percolation.\r\n",
