 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies problems of wave propagation in\r\ncomplex media, using both analytical and numerical techniques.\r\nLong range propagation of seismic and other waves in domains that\r\ninvolve both external boundaries and sharp interfaces between\r\nrandom media with different characteristics are studied.  The\r\ncorrect boundary and interface conditions are analyzed from first\r\nprinciples (wave equations) for smooth and random interfaces.\r\nThey are used to derive the interface conditions in the diffusion\r\napproximation that is more tractable for numerical simulations.\r\nAnalytical and numerical methods for the analysis of the matrix\r\nvalued radiative transport equations for polarized waves are\r\ndeveloped.  Effects of inhomogeneous turbulent flows on acoustic\r\nwave propagation and in some other problems (front propagation in\r\ncombustion problems) are also addressed.\r\n     Wave propagation is one of the most fundamental physical\r\nprocesses.  Many physical applications require consideration of\r\nwaves in highly inhomogeneous media.  These include such basic\r\nphenomena as acoustic wave propagation in the atmosphere, seismic\r\nwaves in the Earth, and many others.  Direct application of wave\r\nequations to such problems is beyond reach of even the fast\r\ncomputers available today.  The radiative transport theory is a\r\nvaluable approximation that describes energy propagation of waves\r\nin complex media with rapid fluctuations of the material\r\nproperties.  One of the most promising applications is in seismic\r\nwave propagation, where this theory has been successfully applied\r\nin the last ten years, in particular to model propagation of\r\ndisturbances caused by earthquakes.",
