The objective of this meeting is to evaluate the current research results in the field, and discuss future research directions and technological developments.   Engineers, chemists and physicists from academe and industry will attempt to identify common principles and approaches and develop collaborations.  The conference is organized in nine technical sections, including overviews, synthesis, theory, characterization, various properties, and applications.  Established and young researchers from Americas, Europe, Japan and Russia will participate.  There will be about 40 invited speakers.   This workshop is addressing topics related to nanoscale structures, critical length scales for given properties, tailored assembling of the nanoscale building blocks, and various areas of application.   Ample time will be allowed for questions and discussions.  A purpose of the meeting is to facilitate the establishment of long term cooperation among researchers in academe and industry in the area of nanocomposite materials.",
