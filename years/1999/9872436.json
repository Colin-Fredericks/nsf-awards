 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to Princeton University, under the direction of Dr. Harold V. Poor, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, \"Dynamic Adaptivity: Enabling Technology for Emerging Wireless Systems.\" This is a joint project with Cornell University, Dr. R. C. Johnson, co-P.I., that involves the development of courses and courseware in the field of adaptive signal processing for wireless communications.  The development is intended to bring the latest research results in this area into the classroom.  To mesh with the P.I.s research, the courses will focus on two main areas: equalization and multiuser detection.  Wireless systems for mobile telephony and data transmission are currently undergoing very rapid development due to recent international agreements opening new regions in the radio spectrum to such services.  This area has been one of the most active in Electrical Engineering over the past few years, and promises to continue to be so in the foreseeable future. In particular, this project plans to  develop, deliver, and assess courseware (including CAD-oriented experiments) to teach the needed material both to practicing engineers in the telecommunications industry, and to master's level graduate students expecting to enter this industry.  The material will be delivered first in short-course form to industrial partners, who will participate in on-campus delivery as well.  Significant use of new technology is expected through the McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning and through the Friend Center, an innovative facility for engineering instruction at Princeton.  The initiation of longer-term projects, such as the preparation of a suitable subset of the material to the advanced undergraduate level, will also be a part of this effort.",
