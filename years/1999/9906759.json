 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Project is the third biennial, international Gordon Conference on thermodynamics.  It will be held 18-23 April, 1999, at Il Ciocco in Tuscany, Italy.  The Conference sites oscillate between the U.S.A. and Europe, in large part because of the many scientists and engineers working\r\nin this area in Europe.  \"Thermodynamics\" is interpreted very broadly for the purposes of these meetings.  The session topics will be:\r\n1. Energy analysis today and tomorrow;\r\n2. Engineering design;\r\n3. Thermodynamics of complexity;\r\n4. Thermodynamics of computation;\r\n5. Thermodynamics of phase change and phase equilibrium in small systems;\r\n6. Thermodynamic optimization in naturally organized systems;\r\n7. Quantum statistical mechanics and surface kinetics;\r\n8. Thermodynamics in economics.\r\nAs of 2 April, 1999, 128 people had registered. Realistically, we do not expect this number because several have applied from Russia and will probably have insufficient funds to attend.  However the expected set of\r\nparticipants will include at least one Nobelist, many young scientists and representatives from at least 21 nations.  The format will be that of traditional Gordon Conferences, with formal presentations in mornings and evenings, including time for considerable discussion, and informal discussion during the afternoons.  Also in keeping with Gordon Conference regulations, there will be no formal conference proceedings or citations without explicit author's permission of work presented at the Conference. \r\n",
