 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to increased demand for science-based curricula, this Junior College has instituted a Natural Science program and is developing science courses for serving nonscience majors. A new interdisciplinary course entitled Environmental Quality is being developed to satisfy new science core requirements for majors in the Liberal Arts and Education Transfer programs. This project seeks matching funds for the acquisition of equipment for student-based environmental quality assessments of the Lackawanna River, its tributaries, and other water sources which are contaminated with acid mine drainage and combined sewer overflows. Assessment strategies will be based on examining actual and potential impacts on water quality and biota, specifically metals, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, and benthic macroinvertebrates. Portable field analytical instrumentation, in addition to a new laboratory spectro -photometer, will be used to estimate pollutant loads and to evaluate levels of chemical constituents in areas of suspected impact and non-impacted control (reference) sites. Students will become familiar with the scientific methodologies involved in sample collection and analysis, as well as the interrelationships between the biological, chemical, and hydrological components of the environment. Results of the project will be evaluated in terms of scientific validity, contributions to environmental databases, and its impact on student learning. Dissemination of results will occur through research publications and conference presentations.",
