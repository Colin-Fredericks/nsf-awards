The majority of the faculty which will benefit from the new instrumentation are of multi-disciplinary origin,\r\ni.e., bioorganic, biochemical, bioinorganic, medicinal, and environmental. The principal investigators are engaged in multi-disciplinary research that involves the synthesis of molecules of biological and fundamental importance.  Research areas which require this instrumentation include: 1) synthesis of\r\nfluorine-containing molecules, 2) synthesis of indole analogs and unnatural amino acids, 3) synthesis of chelating agents for environmental remediation, 4)synthesis of new metalloid-containing amino acids 5)study of bio-incorporated nuclei via NMR spectroscopy, and 6)synthesis of technetium and rhenium complexes.  Research in these areas may lead to techniques that can be exploited in a variety of important areas, such as the pharmaceutical industry (drug design) and environmental clean-up operations.  It is a known fact that both health and environmental problems lie ahead in the 21st century and will need to be\r\naddressed.  The atomic level understanding of chemical structure is necessary to challenge these hurdles. The most important tool for elucidating the structure of compounds studied in these research areas is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These studies require analysis of a variety of atomic nuclei for proper characterization.  For our purposes, these nuclei include hydrogen, carbon, phosphorus, fluorine, boron, silicon, selenium, and tellurium.  The requested instrumentation is capable of being tuned to all of these nuclei. \r\n\r\nTennessee Tech is a predominantly undergraduate institution that has a rigorous program in undergraduate research. The chemistry department sends 10-15 students per year to national and regional meetings where they present the results of their research findings. The acquisition of this instrumentation is\r\nvital to both the faculty research programs and to the department's continued development of this undergraduate multidisciplinary research program. Tennessee Tech is located midway between Nashville and Knoxville, serving the east-central portion of Tennessee. Most of the department graduates plan careers in the medical or biotechnology profession and ultimately attend graduate schools, professional schools, industry, or medical schools. Most research is carried out by faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates.\r\nThe department has sixteen full-time faculty members. \r\n",
