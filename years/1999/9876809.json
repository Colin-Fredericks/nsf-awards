 "awd_abstract_narration": "With about 14,000 vertebrate individuals represented in its holdings (mostly birds), the Burke Museum Genetic Resources Collection at the University of Washington (UW)is among the top five such collections for birds in the United States and is actively growing at a rate of about 1,500 individual vertebrate representatives per year.  The Collection is surprisingly broad for its size, with recent major acquisitions of frozen tissue specimens from northern Asia, Nicaragua, South Africa, Argentina, Australia, the Solomon Islands and the North Pacific Ocean.  Two of the most valuable attributes of the collection are its focus on general, as opposed to research-driven, collecting, and its near complete representation of individual tissue specimens as voucher and extended wing specimens in the Ornithology and Mammalogy Collections.  The increasing momentum of the Genetic Resources Collection is evident in several recent appointments, including a Curator of Genetic Resources, a Curator of Mammals, and a Manager of Genetic Resources.\r\n\r\nIn the last five years, the Collection has distributed over 1,700 samples to systematists, evolutionary biologists and biomedical scientists in 8 countries at a rate that continues to grow.  The Genetic Resources Collection has provided samples that have contributed to over 35 publications in the last five years, and in several cases has provided the core materials for doctoral dissertations both at the University of Washington and elsewhere.  The Collection is curated by a Curator of Genetic Resources and a full-time Manager of Genetic Resources.  Nonetheless, increasing demands on specimen storage and Curation of the collection, due both to increased specimen acquisition from University and privately funded field expeditions and to increased demand for specimens from inside and outside the UW, necessitate funding for further storage equipment, computers and labor to reduce the backlog of specimens not yet integrated into the Collection and database.\r\n\r\nTo meet this increase in demand, this project will assist in the (1) purchase two additional upright -80C freezers and associated CO 2 backup systems, racks, storage boxes, specimen tubes and electrical modifications; (2) purchase an improved database backup system; (3) employ a graduate student to transfer a backlog of 1,500 tissues stored in large vials of lysis buffer and alcohol to 2 ml tubes for freezing; to inventory, transfer to 2 ml vials, install and enter data for 550 heterogeneous frozen tissues not yet inventoried; and to print and affix computer generated labels to all tubes in the collection; (4) purchase an\r\nice maker and dry ice storage vessel for superior storage of tissues in the field and for streamlining the tissue loan protocol; (5) purchase a computer and monitor dedicated to the Genetic Resources Database.  The availability of extra freezers, dry ice storage, and an ice maker will increase the quality of tissues when transferred from local field sites and the ease with which tissues from recently returned expeditions can be organized and accessioned.  The computer will increase self-sufficiency of the Curator and Manager in curation and management of its database.",
