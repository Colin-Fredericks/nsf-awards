 "awd_abstract_narration": "The City University of New York (CUNY) proposes to use the NSF/MGE Program to increase the number of Black and Latino students receiving doctoral degrees in the following disciplines: Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth & Environmental Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, and Speech & Hearing Science. This proposed project, Minority Access/Graduate Networking in Sciences, Engineering, and Mathematics (MAGNET-SEM), seeks to extend and evaluate a model for recruitment, retention and support that effectively links multiple layers of higher education across a multi-campus system. Incorporated in the model are four components: a) a supportive community of minority scholars; b) academic opportunities; c) systematic faculty and peer mentoring; and d) financial support. Building on previous successful experiences with minority-targeted programs, the project will combine social services, academic and non-academic types of support, and technology in the recruitment and retention efforts. Financial support of students will be a shared effort among the project, the CUNY system, and the individual colleges. Participating faculty and administrators are committed to the importance of early preparation, a network of communication, minority role models, and peer and faculty mentoring. Research preparation and financial support are also critical for developing minority students' interests and for translating those interests into successful degree completion.",
