 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the next five years North Carolina State University and North Carolina A&T State University will triple their numbers of doctoral students prepared for faculty careers in science, math and engineering (SME). The North Carolina Minority Graduate Education Partnership is a comprehensive recruitment and mentoring initiative designed to change institutional cultures as it develops interest in SME research, and particularly in academic careers, among underrepresented minority students from their junior undergraduate year through completion of doctoral education. Components include intensive faculty-mentored research experiences for minority NC State University SME undergraduate students and for students from NCAMP colleges. NC A&T will identify and recruit NCAMP students to participate in STAR, a transition and retention program for graduate students. Special cluster groups will tackle graduate problem solving and career exploration. Both universities will offer mentored training programs to prepare selected SME doctoral students for future faculty positions. The partner universities will jointly offer research training and student development seminars throughout each year. NC State University will launch a training program for participating faculty designed to develop skills in mentoring diverse populations; a seminar series open to all graduate students and faculty will focus on themes of inclusiveness and issues of diversity.",
