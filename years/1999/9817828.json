Tunable femtosecond lasers now make it possible to study dynamical information about solids in great detail.  Femtosecond lasers probe these systems on the same time-scale as that of scattering processes.\r\n\r\nImprovements in femtosecond laser technology within the last decade have led to the rapid development of new capabilities.  Pulses shorter than five femtoseconds are now possible.  In addition, improvements have occurred in tunability, peak power, and the ability to perform programmable pulse shaping.  This has opened up new opportunities for study including probing carrier dynamics; creating coherent electron/phonon states; pulse shaping and quantum control; and, optoelectronic/photonic applications.\r\n\r\nThis research will extend previous theoretical work in the above areas to further study new and fundamental properties of coherent and incoherent electrons and phonons in condensed matter systems.  Specifically, we will investigate four-wave mixing and differential reflectivity spectroscopy in new materials such as GaN (both coherent and incoherent effects); coherent and incoherent spin relaxation in dilute magnetic semiconductors; extend our work on the theory of coherent phonons to superlattices and superconductors and include the effects of dissipation; and, study wave packet dynamics/quantum control in superlattices and further investigate how a correlated wave packet loses its coherence.\r\n9817828\r\nThis is a grant for theoretical research on the ultrafast dynamics of coherent and incoherent electrons and phonons in solids.
