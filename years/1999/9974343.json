This phenomenon, termed polyamorphism, introduces new perspectives to our perception of the amorphous state of matter. It is therefore indicated to conduct an assessment of this phenomenon and determine its impact on future directions in glass research. To this end, a conference dedicated to this issue will be held, on the occasion of the Annual Meeting of the American Crystallographic Association, May 22-27, 1999, in Buffalo, NY. The purpose of this conference is to critically evaluate the leading findings that suggest polyamorphism, assess the importance of this concept, and its implications for design and processing of glassy materials. The meeting will also address the new challenges ensue for structural characterization, which in this context is facing new challenges.  Polyamorphism is a fairly new concept and researchers in this area come from various backgrounds, including materials science, condensed matter physics, applied mathematics, chemistry, geology, etc.  This diversity is reflected in the list of invited speakers.  The invited speakers represent most of the researchers from around the world who have conducted pioneering work on this subject matter.  The three symposia that comprise this conference are entitled:  Dynamics at and Below the THz; Alternative Methods for Structural Characterization; and Structural Transitions and Poly(a)morphism.  Each of the symposia will be led off with 1 or 2 invited talks and then followed by contributed papers.  At the end of each day time has been set aside for discussion.  The results of this conference will be available as a proceedings.  \r\n%%%\r\nThis conference on polyamorphism in non-crystalline materials will be held in conjunction with the annual American Crystallographic Association meeting.  The consensus of the scientific community is that our understanding about the structure of non-crystalline materials is incomplete.  Recent work by a variety of researchers indicates that the several amorphous states, or phases, may exist for one material.  This conference will allow researchers to compare results of their work and thus enable them to develop new ideas and directions for research in glass science and technology.\r\n***\r\n",
