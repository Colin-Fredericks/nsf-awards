Each season would consist of 40, daily, half-hour shows -- each including a number of science and/or mathematics segments.   A unique aspect of ZOOM is that every idea and activity on the show comes from a child who writes or e-mails the show and who is credited on-air for his or her contribution.  Production staff and a working group of advisors with expertise in science and math education take these raw ideas and develop them into program segments and outreach projects designed to encourage \"habits of mind\" -- a set of problem-solving skills and dispositions toward science and math that has been developed in concert with the advisors.  Three over-arching science and math-based themes also guide the way science and math are presented over the course of a season.  \r\n\r\nOutreach for Seasons II and III will build on the solid base of outreach developed for Season I, and will consist of:\r\n\r\n ZOOMerang:  Every child who communicates with ZOOM will get something back such as a compilation of science and math activities, jokes, poems, recipes and a series update.\r\n\r\n ClubZOOM:  A set of standards-based science and math activities will be developed along with guidance for how to create after-school clubs.  This effort will be pilot tested at 20 sites.\r\n\r\n ZOOMzones:  These are areas in science-technology centers and museums that are devoted to ZOOM and include opportunities for youth and families to interact with science and math content featured on ZOOM.  Ten pilot ZOOMzone sites were developed for Season I (from 80 applications).  The number of ZOOMzones will be increased and continuing support will be offered to existing sites during Seasons II and III.\r\n\r\n ZOOMdays:  During Season III, WGBH will develop ZOOMdays at shopping malls to reach youth who may not have access to ZOOMzones or ClubZOOM.\r\n\r\n ZOOMweb site:  This web site provides an outreach extension to the TV series by collecting and sharing submissions; illustrating and producing science and math activities; creating a ZOOM community; providing research links to other sites; and aiding adults who are interested in furthering ZOOM's science and math activities in their homes, classrooms, museums and after-school programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
