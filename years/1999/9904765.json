 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK-II) is a widespread and multi-functional protein kinase involved in the regulation of ion channels, the cytoskeleton and cell growth.  Over two dozen isozymes are generated from four CaMK-II genes through alternative splicing in a central variable region and at the C-terminus.  This research project is based on the hypothesis that the central variable region is necessary for targeting CaMK-II to specific intracellular locations and thus to its proper substrates. Of particular interest are isozymes of delta CaMK-II which are down-regulated in transformed cells and activated in differentiated cells.  Delta CaMK-II isozymes concentrate in the perinuclear region and extend discontinuously along cytoskeletal tracks.  Constitutively active mutants of delta CaMK-II arrest cell division and induce the formation of cellular extensions in NIH/3T3 cells.  Isozymes of beta or gamma CaMK-II do not exhibit this effect, have different localizations, and lack the delta CaMK-II-specific proline-containing sequences.  To test the role of these sequences, this research will define the minimum sequence motif necessary to target delta CaMK-II to the cytoskeleton by using fluorescence microscopy to visualize the effects of deletion and point mutations on proteins tagged with green fluorescent protein. This research will ultimately lead to the identification of proteins to which CaMK-II is anchored, information which will be critical to understand the substrates and thus mechanism of action of this important protein kinase family.  These studies have potential implications for many basic biological activities of cells in which this enzyme has been implicated.\r\n",
