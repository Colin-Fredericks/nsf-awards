The Principal Investigator is Professor Musharraf Zaman, of the Department of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science, University of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma.  The Bangladeshi organizer is Dr. A.K.M. Kamaluddin Choudhury of the Asia Pacific University.  The topics will cover: climate change, green house gas emission, global warming, sea level rise (SLR), social impacts of SLR, mean sea level determination and monitoring, land subsidence (natural and induced), coastal sedimentation and erosion, and climate change mitigation measures.  The objectives of the three-day workshop are: (1) review and discuss the current knowledge regarding factors contributing to seal level rise and the effect of SLR on land accretion and erosion, and (2) identify potentially productive areas for collaborative research.  The scientists plan to visit some of the sites most susceptible to damage as a result of sea level rise.\r\n\r\nScope:  This project will bring well known US specialists in climate studies, coastal area research, and in social science research with their counterparts in Bangladesh, and with participants from other countries, to develop an agenda for joint research in an important area of global change that is of interest to the two countries.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting international workshops that are likely to increase collaboration in areas of mutual interest.  \r\n",
