 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use modem pedagogical methods and computer data acquisition technology to improve biology education at Goshen College. Goshen College has a reputation for strong science programs, but the current curriculum is weak in the area of modem physiology. This project will develop a large number of inquiry-type physiology lab exercises. Students, working in groups, will develop a hypothesis, design a way to test it, collect appropriate data, and present the data. In these exercises, students will develop a range of analytical and collaborative skills. Appropriate concepts and laboratory techniques will be embedded in the process.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funding for equipment, personnel time, and related costs to effect these changes. Goshen College will match the amount requested. The equipment will provide capability for computer data acquisition and access to data analysis and presentation tools. The project will focus on student work in laboratories of two classes: (I)Vertebrate Physiology; and (2)Human Anatomy and Physiology. Many of the key exercises in these classes will be adapted from work previously funded by the NSF. Students will make more limited but significant use of the equipment in courses in Health, Biological Principles, and Physiological Psychology.\r\n\r\nThe new inquiry activities will be offered in the 1999-2000 academic year, involving 200 students. Revised activities, final assessment and dissemination of results will occur in the 20002001 academic year. Student work will be evaluated by regular oral and written reports. An independent evaluator will review student work at the beginning and end of each semester. Evaluations will focus on student's quantitative, analytical, and collaborative skills, and on their communication of experimental data. Laboratory exercises and examples of student work will be posted on the web, and presented at local and national conferences.\r\n",
