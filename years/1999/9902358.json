The research effort will be headed by Dr. Daniel J. Dorney of Virginia Commonwealth University and Dr. Victor Saren of the Central Institute of Aviation Motors in Moscow.  This study expects to improve the efficiency of gas-turbine compressors through the use of (1) bowed airfoils, which are airfoils designed to reduce blade loadings near endwalls, and thus minimize secondary flows, and (2) airfoil clocking, which is adjusting the circumferential location of airfoils in adjacent rotating and non-rotating blade rows to reduce unsteadiness and total pressure losses.  The experimental portion of the program will be performed by scientists in Moscow, while the computational portions of the program will be undertaken by researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University, Texas A&M University, and Boston University.\r\n\r\nThis research in engineering fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
