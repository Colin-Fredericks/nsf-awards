A goal of the exploratory synthesis area is to escape the intellectual confines of our knowledge base and to discover the unexpected.  There has been much emphasis recently on the development of new materials by design.  Indeed, our present understanding is such that many important materials problems can be addressed using this rational approach.  However, it would be intellectually arrogant to believe that the most spectacular new properties of materials will be confidently predicted from our present knowledge base.  Exciting classes of materials that have eluded us likely require special synthesis techniques or have complex structures and compositions.  Oxides generally have advantages over other materials both in ease of synthesis and in terms of high stability in the presence of air.  A new aspect of this program will be the exploratory synthesis of oxides as thin films.  When a significant discovery is made, exploitation of that discovery will begin immediately.  This exploitation could include systematic and applied studies.  In the case of materials showing negative thermal expansion, a systematic approach to their discovery is being developed and actively pursued.  Students will be trained to understand the interrelationships of chemistry, structure, properties, and applications.\r\n%%%\r\nIt is the goal of this project to discover new materials that are useful, inexpensive, nontoxic, and easy to manufacture.  Many new compounds will be prepared in the course of this project, but only a small percentage will have potentially useful properties.  Some of the new materials will have a significant impact on science, technology, and society.\r\n***\r\n",
