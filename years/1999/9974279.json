 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using concepts and measures drawn from developmental psychology, social psychology, and social neuroscience, this research examines factors that create, trigger, and maintain violence and neglect in family relationships. It is proposed that a focus on competitive power within close relationships acts to increase the risk of violence. Those parents who are overly focused on maintaining a power advantage in the family are expected to respond inappropriately to their children's behavior. In this research, parents who are at risk to become abusive are identified before the birth of a child. Families are then studied for the first two years of the child's life. It is expected that parents who are initially \"power-oriented\" (and especially if their children have a \"difficult\" temperament) will respond in maladaptive ways to their very young children. Such parents are expected to be more likely to (a) show physiological stress responses (e.g., increased production of cortisol; elevated levels of blood pressure), and (b) exhibit biased interpretation and recall of children's behaviors (e.g., interpretation of children's actions as intentional challenges to their authority). These responses, in turn, are expected to increase the likelihood that such parents will show ineffective caregiving tactics, and will either physically abuse or neglect their children.  If predictions are confirmed, our understanding of families under stress will be improved, and new insight will be gained into the kinds of prevention efforts that are most likely to prevent child maltreatment.\r\n",
