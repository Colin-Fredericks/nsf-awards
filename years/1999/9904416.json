 "awd_abstract_narration": "9904416\r\nSrivastava\r\nThe long term goal of this research is to investigate the molecular basis of substrate specificity, conformational changes, and catalysis in recombinant human liver medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD). The specific aims are: (A) To determine the roles of fatty acid and coenzyme-A fragments of acyl-CoAs in modulating the catalytic efficiency and substrate specificity of the enzyme, and (B) To establish a detailed mechanistic description of the roles of  dynamics of the protein conformational transitions on the electronic structures of the enzyme-bound ligands, and the enzyme catalysis. Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is a flavoenzyme, which catalyzes the a-b dehydrogenation of acyl-CoA substrates during the mitochondrial b-oxidative pathway. Preliminary spectroscopic, kinetic, thermodynamic, and model building studies have led to the following hypotheses: (i) The fatty acid and coenzyme-A fragments of acyl-CoAs coordinate in stabilizing the ground and transition state structures during the enzyme catalysis, and (ii) The enzyme-ligand interactions and the enzyme catalysis proceed via obligatory changes in the protein conformation. These hypotheses will be tested via the use of  uv/visible spectroscopy, steady-state and rapid kinetics, isothermal titration microcalorimetry, and computergraphic model building techniques, involving the wild-type and selected site-specific mutations of  MCAD.  This award provides research facilities and training to 3 graduate students, who are currently working in the PI's laboratory toward obtaining their Ph.D./M.S. degrees. \r\n\r\nThis research will unravel several intrinsic features of the role of the protein structures in modulating functions. Despite the availability of the 3-dimensional structures of several proteins, the role of the molecular forces responsible for steering and immobilizing different types of ligands at their cognate protein sites during the course of binding and catalysis is not clearly understood. Such properties are of utmost importance in modern biotechnology, particularly from the point of view of designing novel enzymes, pesticides, and other commercially valuable products.  Preliminary data from the principal investigator's laboratory have led to the suggestion that medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of fatty acids to generate energy) is one of a class of unique enzymes, which exhibit a fairly broad range of substrate specificity and coordinate among different regions of the substrate structures. These features provide an opportunity to use medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase as a model system for delineating the sequence of events involved during the course of ligand binding and catalysis among enzymes in general. \r\n\r\n",
