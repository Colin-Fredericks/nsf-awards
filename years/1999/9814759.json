 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to study stability and sensitivity of flow control protocols for best-effort or available bit rate (ABR) traffic on integrated networks.  Rigorous mathematical analysis will be carried out to produce a general stability and sensitivity theory for ABR flow control. The theoretical results will be obtained via extensive simulations and analytical derivation. Robust flow control protocols to combat spatial, temporal, and integration variations will be designed and tested.                                                                                            \r\nThe following tasks will be carried out:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1.      A general theory of stability and sensitivity of rate-based ABR flow control protocols will be developed. The concepts of stability and sensitivity will be formalized. The new theory will use the concept of control but the formulation will be based on combinatorial analysis of the distributed asynchronous operations of the protocols. Various factors affecting the stability will be investigated and classified. The emphasis will be on the control laws themselves.\r\n2.      The spatial aspects of the stability and sensitivity theory will be further investigated in conjunction with existing protocols. The emphasis will be on the robustness of the protocols in the face of network uncertainty, transient behaviors, and misbehaving components. A model spatially robust protocol will be developed.\r\n3.      The temporal aspects of the stability and sensitivity theory will be further investigated in conjunction with existing protocols. The emphasis will be on the temporal variations of background traffic and disparity of feedback latencies. A model temporally robust protocol will be developed.\r\n4.      The integration aspects of the stability and sensitivity theory will be further investigated in conjunction with existing protocols. The emphasis will be on interactions between protocols and traffic control mechanisms from networks of distinct architectures. The aim of this theory is to provide\r\nguidelines on how to seamlessly integrate multiple networks or multiple protocols. A model interactively robust protocol will be developed.\r\n5.      Well-known and widely deployed protocols and the new protocols developed in this project will be extensively simulated and tested in various integrated network configurations for stability and sensitivity. The purpose is to verify the theories derived and to test the protocols developed from this project.\r\n",
