 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little Rock Lake in northern Wisconsin has been the site of a whole-lake acidification experiment since 1983.  The lake was divided into a reference basin that was left unmodified and a treatment basin that was acidified between 1985 and 1990.  During the three, 2-year phases of increasing acidification, the PIs documented a wide range of responses to the acid additions.  Since 1991, the PIs  have been evaluating the natural capacity of the lake to recover from the direct and indirect effects of acidification.  The lake has largely returned to pre-acidified chemical conditions.  By spring 1995, the lake's pH was close to the 6.1 value that occurred prior to the manipulation.  In contrast, some biological characteristics of the lake exhibited a substantially slower recovery.  In particular, through 1996, the taxonomic composition of the treatment basin's zooplankton community remained different from the community occurring in the reference basin.  By 1997, however, there were signs that the zooplankton were beginning to be similar in the treatment and reference basins.  This project will complete the PIs evaluation of Little Rock Lake's recovery and test the hypothesis that the treatment basin's zooplankton community will be essentially the same as that in the reference basin in 1999 and 2000, 9 and 10 years following the last acid additions.  The PIs will also evaluate an analytical technique to distinguish whether the zooplankton community in the treatment basin has formed a long-standing community distinctly different from that in the reference basin or if there was a delayed response in its recovery. Large-scale experiments such as the Little Rock Lake project operate at an interface between applied and theoretical ecology.  Completing the PIs evaluation of the lake's recovery will allow the PIs to complete the  documentation of Little Rock Lake's full range of reactions to acidification and to evaluate some of the basic processes that control long-term dynamics in lakes.",
