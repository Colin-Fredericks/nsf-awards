 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to Illinois State University supports the research of Professor Lisa F. Szczepura.  The theme of the research is the investigation of the mechanism of ligand substitution of supraoctahedral transition metal clusters of the form (M'M6X8)n (where M' and M are transition metals and X = S, Se, or Te) that are important for understanding cluster reactivity.  In particular, the effects of spectator ligands on the rates of ligand exchange will be examined.  A second goal is the study of the redox reactivity of supraoctahedral clusters.\r\n\r\nThe clusters studied in this project are part of a class of substances called Chevrel phase materials, which exhibit superconducting properties even in high magnetic fields.  However, other applications include use as heterogeneous catalysts and as cathode materials in rechargeable lithium and lithium ion batteries.  Studies of these types of clusters have a significant impact on the development of new lithium batteries with increased cycle life.\r\n",
