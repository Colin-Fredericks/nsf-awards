 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry is actively pursuing reform throughout the undergraduate curriculum, particularly at the introductory level.  We are developing a unique model for interactive learning adapting a studio approach that integrates the laboratory and lecture portions of a chemistry course into one seamless experience through the use of web-based instruction.  This approach represents a radical departure from the traditional \"blackboard style\" lecture format, and emphasizes a hands-on, learn by doing, approach that is structured around a series of activities.  Computers are being used for both communication during class meetings and for data acquisition using the multifunctional computer-interface module called LabWorks, which allows a beginning student to design experiments, acquire data, and interpret results.  Communication is by means of a course web page that students follow during class meetings to obtain instructions and acquire additional background.\r\n\r\nThis project most closely adapts the studio approach developed for chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and California Polytechnic State University.  The project also adapts elements of the guided inquiry approach used at Franklin and Marshall College, the Workshop Chemistry peer-led team learning approach developed by the Chemistry Initiative led by CUNY City College, and the modular approach developed by the ChemLinks Chemistry Initiative led by Beloit College.\r\n\r\nStudents also use the computers for electronic homework and for accessing the huge array of free educational software available on the world-wide web.  We believe that the cumulative effect of the studio approach will promote learning and also increase student enthusiasm for chemistry.  This model can be easily transferred and improved upon at practically every institution that imparts instruction at the undergraduate level.  It also should be transferable to high school chemistry classes, especially those on block scheduling.",
