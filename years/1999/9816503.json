 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project from Prof. Luis Echegoyen at the University of Miami is focused on the electrochemical properties of substituted fullerenes, with the promise that electrodeposited thin layers of such materials will exhibit unique and exploitable properties.  The first area of research focuses on compounds that tether a crown ether moiety to the fullerene base.  As cations move into the crown ether, the electrochemical properties of the entire complex are changed.  A second part of the proposed research is the induced isomerization of malonate complexes of the fullerenes, with the promise that this isomerization reaction can be controlled to provide a synthetic route to otherwise inaccessible compounds.  Finally, controlled potential electrolysis of functionalized fullerenes is used to produce free fullerenes that are trapped within a molecular box framework.   Prof. Echegoyen's research group has an excellent record for the education of professional chemists from underrepresented groups, based on past record, and that tradition is expected to continue.\r\n\r\nThis project takes advantage of some recently discovered chemistry of \"buckyballs\", namely the ability to derivatize them and control their electrochemical reactivity, and the ability to trap species inside of the buckball cavity to accomplish the same goal.  The diversity of chemical groups that link to the buckyball substrate is broad, and so the range of reactive tunability is correspondingly large, allowing surfaces with specific properties to be devised.  Such a skill is useful in creating better electrode materials and better sensors for chemical analysis.\r\n",
