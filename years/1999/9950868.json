 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is adopting the modular approach to teaching chemistry courses specifically to a non-Science, Math, Technology, and Engineering (non-SMET) audience. We are adapting three modules previously developed by ChemConnections (ModularChem Consortium and ChemLinks Coalition) for use in a new, environmental chemistry-based non-SMET chemistry course. Six new modules also are being developed, tested, and refined. Three of the new modules are for use in a course with a \"Chemistry of Materials\" theme, while the other three modules are being created for a course with a \"Chemistry in Society\" theme. Several new laboratory explorations are planned for use with the new modules. We are incorporating Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry into these explorations.\r\n\r\nDissemination of the results of this project is occurring through presentations at regional and national meetings. Additionally, we intend to publicize the availability of the new modules through ChemConnections and electronically disseminate them to anyone wishing to adapt them for use at their own institution.\r\n",
