 "awd_abstract_narration": "9907724\r\nBierman\r\n\r\nHuman hands have changed dramatically the New England landscape over the past 250 years.  Only 100 years ago, much of now-forested New England was cleared of trees as agriculture and development drove the rapid conversion of forest to farmland.  The bare hills of post-colonial Vermont eroded rapidly and sediment surged down hillslopes, choking the region's rivers.  Just as importantly, landscape response to natural events including floods and windstorms affected post-colonial settlers and their livelihood.  Currently, geologic archives of landscape response to climate change and human impact (pond and alluvial fans sediments) are being read by NSF CAREER-funded graduate and undergraduate students pursuing a variety of research projects at the University of Vermont.  The investigators will integrate this funded research with the hands-on education of high school students and explore another archive, one that preserves evidence of human-induced landscape change at an instant of time.  In an integrated research and education program designed to involve high school science students and their teachers directly in active, on-going geologic research, the project will build a digital library of photographs documenting two centuries of landscape change.  Specifically, students across Vermont will compile historic photographs that show first hand, human/landscape interaction in New England including clear-cutting, gully erosion, storm damage, and landslides.  Students will scour their own community and personal resources locating images that show Vermont landscapes as they were 75 to 150 years ago.  Such photographs can be found in the student's homes, in the homes of their older relatives, in local historical societies, and in local libraries.  The investigators will work directly with teachers and their classes in 18 different Vermont high schools.  Using for guidance a standards-based manual, teachers will assist students as they find at least two historic photographs clearly showing human/landscape interaction.  The students will attempt to relocate the place from which each photo was taken.  The site will be mapped using hand-held GPS and the scene rephotographs in detail using local reference sources including interviews, library research, and field observations.  All images will be brought to the students' schools and scanned using equipment that will be loaned to each school for 6 to 8 weeks.  The final result will be a pair of photographs, new and old, georeferenced and captioned by the student to explain the historic impact and the landscape response.  As each class finishes its town, a statewide database, housed and available publicly on the Web, will grow.  Created by students involved in on-going research using modern technology, this photo archive will be a digital resource for people around the world.  The impact will be long lasting in terms of both formal and informal science education.  The long-term goal is for the archive to include photographs from every town in Vermont showing human-induced geologic change.  The effort will be supported by the University and local foundations interested in education reform.\r\n",
