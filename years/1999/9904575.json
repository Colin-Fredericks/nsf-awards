 "awd_abstract_narration": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) receives, folds, and sorts proteins that are secreted from the eukaryotic cell or that are targeted to other intracellular organelles.  To facilitate the import, or translocation, of these proteins into the ER, a myriad of cytoplasmic and lumenal factors associated with the ER are housed in multi-protein machines.  Included in these machines are molecular chaperones, factors that play vital roles during protein folding and degradation in the cell and that have been shown to regulate multi-protein complexes in vitro. Compromising the activities of molecular chaperones arrests the import of some proteins into the ER.  The mechanism by which these factors facilitate protein translocation is poorly understood, in part because pleiotrophic defects in many cellular processes occur when the activity of a single chaperone is compromised in vivo.  To circumvent this problem in order to understand the specific effects of chaperones on ER import, reconstituted in vitro systems have been developed.  The subsequent isolation of novel chaperone mutants from the model yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and their analysis in such in vitro assays, permits a molecular detailing of which chaperone activities are required to support protein translocation.\r\n\r\nChaperones required for protein translocation in yeast include the hsp70 ATPases BiP and Ssa1p in the ER lumen and cytoplasm, respectively, and the DnaJ homologues Sec63p and Ydj1p in the lumen and cytoplasm, respectively.  Hsp70s and DnaJ proteins are known to cooperate and facilitate a number of cellular processes in all species in which they have been identified.\r\n\r\nA recent analysis of new dominant lethal BiP mutants indicates that an ATP-dependent conformational change is imperative to support the interaction between BiP and Sec63p and is necessary to drive protein import into the ER.  This project includes biochemical studies to determine why dominance arises in these mutants.  The results of these experiments will indicate which essential role(s) BiP plays during protein import, and may either validate or refute existing hypotheses describing the action of molecular chaperones during protein translocation.  \r\n\r\nThe mechanism by which the cytosolic chaperones Ssap1 and Ydjp1 facilitate translocation and the requirement for ATP hydrolysis by Ssa1p during import remains mysterious.  To unravel this mystery, novel ATPase-defective ssa1 mutants were constructed and the resulting proteins purified during the preceding funding period.  In this renewal project, the mutant and wild type proteins will be subjected to a battery of established biochemical tests to elucidate how Ssa1p ATPase activity is coupled to protein translocation.  \r\n\r\nYdj1p plays ill-defined roles during both translocation and protein translation on ribosomes; therefore multicopy suppressors of a ydj1p temperature sensitive mutants were obtained, one of which was a gene encoding an uncharacterized hsp110 chaperon, Sse1p.  The contribution of this chaperone to the translocation and translation reactions, both in vivo and in vitro, will be determined.  \r\n\r\nBecause of their vital, diverse roles in cellular processes, studies of molecular chaperone function have yielded clues regarding the fundamental mechanisms underlying DNA replication, protein degradation and phosphorylation, and cell cycle control.  The continued analysis of chaperone functions using novel biochemical, cell biological and genetic tools will undoubtedly continue to contribute to the understanding of these and other cellular functions.\r\n",
