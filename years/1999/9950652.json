 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n9950652:\r\nWe recently recognized four areas for improvement in undergraduate education: greater use of technology, increased student-faculty research, emphasis on innovative teaching strategies, and enhanced interdisciplinary study. Accordingly, the Departments of Geography-Earth Science, Biology, and Teacher Education at SU are developing the \"Burd Run Interdisciplinary Watershed Research Laboratory\" to improve undergraduate science education. Some existing courses are being improved through new field and laboratory exercises based on state-of-the-art equipment. Perhaps more importantly, learning is being linked across courses and disciplines, allowing students to build and integrate scientific skills throughout their education using the watershed as a common case study.  \r\n\r\nThe watershed laboratory is expected to: (1) provide intensive undergraduate field training through collection and analysis of related environmental data from a single watershed, (2) establish a comprehensive watershed database and digital map library using a geographic information system (GIS), (3) provide access to the database through enhanced computer laboratories and a project internet site supporting interdisciplinary student studies in a wide variety of environmentally related courses, and (4) facilitate similar approaches at other institutions through conference presentations, publications, and internet access to the database and instructional/curricular materials.\r\n\r\nThis project is improving earth-space science and biology education curricula by providing pre-service teachers with intensive training in scientific methods as applied in a field and laboratory learning environment.  The watershed laboratory is being made available for use by public school classes, giving pre-service teachers opportunities to observe their intended careers in action.  This project is also promoting faculty development through campus-wide instructional innovation workshops providing instruction on project equipment and GIS skills, and increasing field opportunities for women through related university programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
