This is the case even though it is a classical problem and one \r\nfundamental to an understanding of turbulent flow. Friedlander will \r\ncontinue to exploit the concept of a \"fluid Lyapunov exponent\" which \r\nprovides an effective means for detecting high frequency instabilities in \r\nthe essential part of the spectrum. Instabilities may also arise in the \r\ndiscrete spectrum and in this situation no general approach is, at present, \r\npossible. Analysis of the eigenvalue problem will be given for a specific \r\n2-dimensional flow with a \"cat's eye\" type structure which appears to \r\ntypify an interesting class of flows containing both oscillatory regions and \r\nhyperbolic stagnation points. Friedlander also proposes to extend the range \r\nof applicability of a result of Friedlander et al that proves under certain \r\nconditions that linear instability in a PDE implies nonlinear instability. \r\nFriedlander et al recently proved that in two dimensions any steady flow \r\nthat is sufficiently \"close\" to a nondegenerate unstable flow is also \r\nunstable. The harder problem of robustness of instability for 3-\r\ndimensional flows will now be investigated. A novel type of flow on a \r\ntorus with nonzero flux will be investigated using techniques from free \r\nboundary problems.\r\n\r\nThe issue of stability of liquids or gases presents an important example of \r\na physical question that may be addressed through sophisticated \r\nmathematical techniques. The answers have direct physical interpretations: \r\nstable flows are robust under inevitable disturbances in the environment \r\nwhile unstable flows break up rapidly. The question of stability or \r\ninstability of a fluid flow is fundamental to studies of physical phenomena \r\nincluding those in the oceans and the atmosphere. In the view of many \r\nscientists, waves and instabilities lie at the heart of our attempts to use \r\nmathematical models for long term weather prediction and to better \r\nunderstand global climate change. However there are important open \r\nquestions connected with the fundamental equations that underlie all \r\nmodels for fluid behavior. This proposal seeks the answers to some of \r\nthese questions related to fluid instabilities.\r\n",
