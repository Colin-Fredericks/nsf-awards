 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971417\r\nMarker\r\n     The field of logarithmic-exponential series was introduced by van \r\nden Dries, Macintyre, and Marker to study the field of real numbers with\r\nexponentiation.  This field has a natural derivation and provides a\r\nuseful algebraic framework for asymptotic analysis.  For differential\r\nequations over the real numbers, there seems to be a strong connection\r\nbetween having formal solutions in the logarithmic-exponential series\r\nand having real non-oscillating solutions at infinity.  Marker will\r\ncontinue to study this connection.  Marker will also work on more\r\ngeneral problems in the model theory of differential fields.  This is\r\na fascinating area requiring a sophisticated mixture of ideas from\r\nstability theory, differential algebra, and algebraic geometry.  In\r\nparticular, he hopes to work on problems in differential Galois theory\r\nand on applying geometric ideas of Hrushovski to understand the\r\ngeometric behavior of solutions of generic equations.\r\n     In recent years, tools from mathematical logic have provided new\r\ninsights into problems in classical mathematics.  Model theoretic methods\r\nhave been remarkably successful in proving new results on the geometry\r\nof solution sets to exponential algebraic equations and general\r\nalgebraic differential equations.  This work has already found\r\napplications in asymptotic analysis, control theory, micro-local\r\nanalysis, number theory and neural networks.  One aspect of Marker's\r\nwork attempts to use logical and algebraic tools to understand the\r\nasymptotic behavior of solutions to differential equations.  Another\r\naspect is attempting to understand the geometry of the solution sets\r\nto very general differential equations.\r\n***\r\n\r\n \r\n",
