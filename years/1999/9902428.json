A full day of tutorials is planned for educators.  Targeted schools include primarily undergraduate institutions, including historically African American colleges, women's colleges, and other colleges with large minority enrollments.  This travel grant will provide partial support for selected individuals from such institutions to attend and participate in the conference and tutorials.  By strengthening faculty knowledge of recent research trends and results, the quality of programming languages and compiler courses will be improved at these institutions and, further, its is expected that interest will be generated among individuals from these underrepresented groups such that some of them will consider careers in computer science.  For the selected participants, travel and subsistence costs are shared between NSF and ACM SIGPLAN and the organization will also provide the registration fees for the tutorial and conference.\r\n\r\n",
