 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intent of the proposed research is to investigate the estimation of fire hazard in the Los Angeles basin using techniques from multivariate point process analysis.  The strategy is to model fire occurrence as a marked spatial-temporal point process whose conditional rate depends not only on the record of previous fires but on other covariates as well.  These covariates include local environmental factors such as temperature, altitude, humidity, precipitation, vegetation, and soil characteristics.  An important component of this research is the assessment of various different models via likelihood analysis (based on past data) and the evaluation of forecasting performance (employing data obtained after the models are fitted).  Using the model, which performs best, the investigators intend to construct quantitative predictions of local fire hazard accompanied by estimates of uncertainties in these predictions.  They also plan to integrate these predicted hazards to form detailed, regularly-updated, maps of the risk of fire within the Los Angeles basin and to make these hazard maps and corresponding numerical local hazard estimates available to fellow scientists and to the public by posting the results, with appropriate explanations, on the World Wide Web.  The investigators' methodology is of interest to scientists studying various other fields besides fire hazard in Los Angeles. Of statistical interest is the use of modern techniques in point process theory such as the application of multi-dimensional branching, Markovian, and multi-stage point process models and the use of the multi-dimensional random time change theorem in assessing such models.  In addition, the methods used in the analysis is applicable not only in obtaining estimates of fire hazard in other regions, but also in quantifying similar types of dangerous occurrences, including floods, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, disease epidemics, etc.\r\n\r\nSome of the most devastating natural disasters in the history of the United\r\nStates have been caused by wildfires.  However, the threat of fire has been examined with insufficient scientific scrutiny and mathematical precision to date. The immediate practical goal of this proposed research is to obtain and disseminate detailed local estimates of the hazard from wildfires in Los Angeles County. The basic strategy is to exploit local trends in fire occurrence and relationships between the incidence of fires and other environmental factors.  The resulting fire hazard estimates, as well as the relationships discovered between fire incidence and other variables, are needed in urban and in the study of how best to mitigate the potentially disastrous effects of fires in and near urban areas.  Of particular concern is the effect of public policies such as aggressive fire suppression and prescribed burning on fire occurrence rate and overall fire hazard.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly supported by the Statistics Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS.\r\n",
