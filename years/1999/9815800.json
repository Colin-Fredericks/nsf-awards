These genes, called major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) genes, will be cloned and sequenced to understand the rates and pattern of DNA changes that have taken place during the evolution of this gene family.\r\n\tMhc genes are of great interest to immunologists because they encode proteins that play a critical role the body's defense against disease in vertebrates.  Mhc genes are of interest to evolutionary biologists because they are the most variable regions of the genome of vertebrates. Most work on these genes, however, has been done on mammals.  By understanding how bird Mhc genes evolve, this research will permit a better understanding of how gene families in different groups of vertebrates change, and, by extension, whether or not the genomes of different groups of vertebrates change in appreciably different ways.  As large-scale genome projects near completion, it will be important to understand how the Mhc genome and the families of genes in it differ and change compared to those in other groups of animals.  This information is important for understanding the diversity of life and genetic change on earth, as well as for understanding how animals such as birds defend themselves against diseases and parasites. \r\n",
