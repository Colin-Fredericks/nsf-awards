The project provides a three-year hands-on science program for 9th-11th graders; peer, faculty and graduate student mentoring; internships; and, opportunities for students to interact with role models.  An outreach component to a grammar school and to Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. is also part of the program.  Over 900 female high school students have participated in the hands-on science program.\r\n",
