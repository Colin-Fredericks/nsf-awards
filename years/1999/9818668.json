 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support project focuses on patterns of enforcement in government regulation of occupational safety.  The project develops and tests a theory that explains how the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), in cooperation with state agencies, enforces the Occupational Safety and Health Act.  The project's central aim is to advance the state of knowledge in political science on the way in which uncertainty about compliance alters how the law is enforced.  The project does so by showing how uncertainty about compliance leads to 1) the development of enforcement routines that reflect strategic decision-making and 2) the adoption of evaluative procedures for enforcement personnel based on easily observed policy outputs.  These routines and procedures directly determine regulatory outcomes and further condition the success of powerful groups seeking to influence policy outcomes.\r\n\r\nTesting the theories involves an examination of how individual cases are treated throughout the enforcement process.  Therefore, a data set has been constructed that disaggregates the OSHAct enforcement process by distinguishing inspection targeting, penalty imposition, and post-penalty negotiation and litigation.  This data set includes information about all private facilities subject to OSHAct regulation, allowing the investigator to diagnose both the treatment of facilities that are filtered into the enforcement process and those facilities that avoid inspection altogether.  Furthermore, with access to information about actual safety conditions at individual facilities (information that is not available even to OSHA's own field offices), the investigator can compare the treatment of \"similar\" facilities in different stages of the enforcement process, under different levels of uncertainty about compliance, and in a variety of group influence environments.  The data are collected through interviews with personnel in a sample of OSH and state agency field offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
