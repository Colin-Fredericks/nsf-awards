 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Detroit Public School District (DPS) proposes to advance significantly the science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) education of all K-12 students through the Detroit Urban Systemic Program (DUSP).  The DUSP accomplishes this task by building on the existing infrastructure developed by reform effort that began in 1991 and was catalyzed by the Urban Systemic Initiative, beginning 1994-present.  The foundational tenets include a strong K-12 leadership team, a standards-based curriculum for science and mathematics based on the Michigan Core Curriculum Framework that is directly linked to the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP).  The core structure is also characterized by a state-driven school accreditation plan coupled with high-stakes accountability measures for districts and schools, and a resolution that requires SMT teaching for grades K-12.  The infrastructure also features converged fiscal and intellectual resources, and significant external support for the implemented curriculum from multiple institutions of higher education (IHE), business partners and the at-large community.\r\n\r\nThe DUSP goals parallel those of the USP that seeks: (1) to improve the urban school district's implementation of a standards-based curriculum; (2) to increase the competency and diversity of the science and mathematics instructional workforce; (3) to promote collaborations with colleges and universities relative to teacher education; (4) to increase the number of skilled entrants to the technology-based workforce; and (5) to employ research as an effective tool in improving the teaching and learning of science and mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe existence of an established infrastructure is validated by four Cornerstone Initiatives and implementation of the standards-based curriculum based on student-centered concepts.  An array of instructional materials supports the implemented curricula that are reviewed, adopted, and adapted for classroom use on an annual basis.  The implemented curriculum features embedded technology, integration of disciplines, community links, problem-based instruction, and writing across the disciplines. \r\n\r\nKey components of the implementation plan include scaling up the institutionalization of the\r\nK-12 standards-based curriculum, research on practice, improvement in the quality of the science and mathematics instructional workforce, and collaborations with IHEs to improve teacher preparation.\r\n\r\n",
