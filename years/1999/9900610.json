 "awd_abstract_narration": "A virtual machine (VM) is a level of abstraction that implements a virtual instruction set architecture on a hardware platform executing a native ISA.  This research focuses on VMs implemented via the co-design of software and hardware using an implementation-dependent instruction set architecture.  Because the hardware-supported architecture is implementation-dependent, performance optimizations can be more easily passed from software through to hardware, and performance feedback information can be more easily passed from hardware up to the software.  Optimizations can be performed by software dynamically, as the program runs. A co-designed virtual machine will include adaptive hardware performance features, continuous hardware performance feedback, and on-the-fly optimizing re-compilation by the VM.\r\n\r\nSpecific research topics include:\r\n\r\n1) The development of a VM co-design framework -- this framework is based on the widely used Simplescalar architecture toolset.\r\n\r\n2) Application of the VM framework to a number of currently important topics in high performance architecture -- these include (but are not limited to) advanced control flow prediction and speculation, hardware-assisted program specialization, and cache management techniques for object-oriented applications.\r\n\r\n3) The study of higher level issues related to VM co-design and dynamic optimization -- these include performance tradeoffs involving the division of work between hardware and software and the development of performance monitoring architecture as an integrated part of an overall architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
