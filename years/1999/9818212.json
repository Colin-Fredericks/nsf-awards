The equipment enables studies in image and video understanding and\r\nanalysis, specifically the research projects cited.  Work in computer vision and image analysis is highly computationally intensive, owing to the large datasets and complex algorithms involved.  All of this computing activity is sandwiched between the data acquisition (imaging) step and the display or other dissemination of results.  The facility will provide a flexible and powerful testbed for the development\r\nand implementation of distributed algorithms for image and video understanding, based on Bayesian network formalisms, as well as the acquisition of high-quality digital imagery and video.  To this end, the facility incorporates a commodity supercomputer (Beowulf cluster) and image analysis workstations with sufficient storage and network bandwidth to handle the demands of image and video processing datasets and algorithms.\r\nBecause many of the applications studied involve high resolution aerial imagery, (near) real-time demands, or motion, this capability and flexibility is crucial.  To maximize the utility of the installation, many input sources and image storage facilities, such as digital cameras and camcorders, framestores, satellite digital video receiver, and 3D scanner are included.\r\n\r\n",
