It is expected that the structure of the underlying passive film will affect the structure and properties of the polypyrrole top coating.  The objective of the proposed study, therefore, is to systematically investigate the effect of process variables on the formation of passive films and coatings on steel during aqueous electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole (Py) and aniline (ANi).  Under investigation are the structure and properties of the passive films, of the coatings and of the passive films-PPy/PANi interface.  The composition, structure and orientation of the passive films and coatings are determined by Attenuated Surface Reflectance Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometry (XPS).  These factors are correlated with the process parameters, such as the applied current, pH and monomer concentration.  The substrates are examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDAX) and XPS to determine the surface morphology, orientation and elemental composition of the passive coatings and passive coatings-PPy/PANi coatings interface.  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) are employed to determine the effects of process variables on the corrosion protection of the coatings.  The work of adhesion and toughness of the coatings formed on passivated steel is determined by dynamic contact angle analysis and the double cantelever beam test.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research is important to understanding the relationships between the electrochemical process variables and the structure and properties of the coatings.  The results should provide information on the mechanism of in-situ passivation and coating of steel and the potential for corrosion prevention by electrodeposited conductive polymers, either as barrier coatings or by anodic protection.\r\n***\r\n",
