The workshop organizers have secured multi-agency (NSF, NOAA, NASA, ONR, EPA, and MMS) support for this effort.  They intend to invite approximately 75 participants who are recognized for their research on coastal ecosystems and/or development and use of in situ sensors for a four-day workshop. In addition, 15-20 observers from government agencies are expected to attend.  The workshop's overall goal is to evaluate the need for in situ measurements and real-time telemetry, promote more effective \"end-to-end\" linkages between measurements, data assimilation, synthesis and applications; and catalyze comparative analysis of environmental issues. \r\n\r\nThe workshop participants will be asked to address three related issues: 1) detecting and predicting change in coastal ecosystems; 2) monitoring-capabilities and information needs; and 3) the design and implementation of integrated, multidisciplinary coastal observing systems.  The product of the workshop will be a report that will present a coherent and comprehensive plan for designing and implementing integrated coastal observing systems that are responsive to user needs.  Results of the workshop will be presented at AGU, ASLO and EFR meetings within one year of the completion of the workshop.\r\n\r\n",
