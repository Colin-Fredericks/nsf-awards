The work integrates seismic data, inferred stratigraphic relationships and subsidence, sedimentation, and erosion rates, and numerical modeling techniques in this area of high sediment fluid flux, high organic productivity, and active vertical tectonism.  These characteristics place the Peruvian margin as an end-member in continental margins with documented hydrate and BSR occurrence.  The research will serve as a baseline for the proposed Peruvian Margin drilling (ODP drilling proposal 355-Full 7).  The field program will occur aboard two R/V Sonne cruises in 2000, and will consist of \"piggyback\" ocean bottom seismometer work involving the deployment of German ocean-bottom seismometers.  The proposed work will provide a test of the hypothesis that vertical tectonics may suppress the formation of gas hydrates, with a subsequent lack of BSR formation.\r\n***",
