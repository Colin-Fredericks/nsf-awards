The instrument will be equipped to satisfy the needs, current and foreseen, of Materials Science researchers fabricating thin films and multilayer structures at the University of Puerto Rico, and those studying samples through external collaborations.  It will allow high precision measurements on crystalline or highly textured films and epitaxial multilayered structures.  The particular instrument requested is of a very adaptable nature, making it suitable for many specific applications, including precision measurements in nearly the full diffraction space, as well as grazing-incidence reflectometry.  This instrument will not duplicate existing XRD instrumentation in Puerto Rico.  Instead, it will complement and complete current resources, enabling fundamental structural characterization of materials now being produced, as well as advanced materials which will be developed in the future.  In order to provide access to the greatest number of researchers, a self-serve facility for qualified users will be established.  A significant number of researchers at the Mayaguez and Rio Piedras campuses of UPR, along with their graduate students, will benefit immediately or in the near future from access to this facility.  It is expected that this substantial improvement of the infrastructure for Materials Science research will be conducive to improved quality of the crystalline materials and structures produced and will stimulate additional work in this area for years to come, and enrich the education and training of students\r\n%%%.\r\nThis equipment will enable the faculty to expand their research activities in several areas, and significantly improve the infrastructure and capability to integrate research and education.\r\n***\r\n",
