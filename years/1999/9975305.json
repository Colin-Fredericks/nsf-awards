 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will search for mid-latitude irregularities in the ionosphere using two very high frequency (VHF) radar systems located in Puerto Rico.  These irregularities are fairly common in the equatorial regions, but have only recently been observed at mid-latitudes.  These earlier detections did not feature a comprehensive set of measurements by which scientists could study the source and evolution of the irregularities.  Because two VHF radar systems were deployed in Puerto Rico last year to support a NASA rocket campaign, there is a unique opportunity to observe mid-latitude irregularities using a variety of different observing instruments.  Especially important is the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar whose field of view roughly coincides with that of the VHF radars.  The Arecibo radar is the world's most sensitive incoherent scatter radar, offering the means to study the ambient electron density and ion and electron temperatures within which the irregularities form.  Most of the time, the 1000 ft antenna at Arecibo is used for radio astronomical observations, but the investigators have acquired observing time during 1999 to make the coordinated measurements with the VHF radars.  This unique data set can be used to study the origin and evolution of mid-latitude sporadic E and spread F, both of which can potentially have deleterious effects on navigation and communication systems.",
