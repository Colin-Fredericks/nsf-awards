 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves investigations in Partial Differential Equations,\r\nwith particular attention to two areas.  One involves the development\r\nof microlocal methods in spectral and scattering theory.  Wave equation\r\ntechniques continue to be important in the analysis of functional calculi\r\nfor many important self-adjoint differential operators.  One type of\r\nproblem in this area is the fine behavior of convergence of generalized\r\neigenfunction expansions for the Laplace operator on a broad class of\r\ncomplete Riemannian manifolds.  Both in this study and other studies\r\nin spectral theory, such as spectral theory for quantum Hamiltonians \r\nfor gauge fields, there arise problems in the Fourier analysis of\r\nFourier integral distributions associated with transversally intersecting\r\nLagrangians.  The project will also treat some inverse scattering\r\nproblems, in which microlocal techniques for eigenfunction expansions\r\nappear as useful tools to filter out that part of the data whose\r\nmeasurement leads to ill posedness.  The other general area involves the \r\nstudy of PDE in various nonsmooth settings.  Some of the work here has \r\nbeen stimulated by work on equations of fluid motion in nonsmooth \r\ndomains.  This work has also led to other problems, such as applications \r\nof layer potential methods to PDE with nonsmooth coefficients, on \r\nLipschitz domains.  This work in turn stimulates work on classes of\r\npseudodifferential operators whose symbols are not regular.\r\n\r\nThe studies of wave motion and fluid motion are fundamental in science and\r\nmathematics.  Reception of wave motion enables one to decode such motion\r\ninto information about the source.  This may involve hearing a bell ring\r\nand inferring its size and location from the tones into which the sound \r\nwaves resolve.  It may involve recording readings of waves generated by\r\na blast in the ground, and drawing conclusions about the ground\r\nunderneath.  The relation between the study of waves produced by a \r\nsource and the set of tones produced, the `spectrum,' is a central topic\r\nin mathematical analysis.  This project will further develop mathematical\r\ntools to study waves and spectra.  It will tackle questions on how \r\ndiffraction effects of waves influence the reconstruction of functions\r\nfrom their spectra, and questions on how to reconstruct an object from\r\nthe waves it scatters.  It will also tackle the equations of fluid motion,\r\nusing techniques of harmonic analysis that are also germane to the study\r\nof waves.\r\n",
