 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this CAREER project focuses on rapid prototyping of bioceramic implants and intends to investigate the following aspects: what are the effects of pore size, pore volume and pore distribution on biocompatibility, bioactivity and the biomechanical properties of porous ceramic implants?  It will examine the effectiveness of various controlled interconnected pore structures on different types of porous bioceramic implants.  This objective will be accomplished using an interdisciplinary approach that integrates advanced manufacturing techniques, fundamental ceramic processing, materials characterization, and biomedical engineering.  Net-shape and near net-shape bioceramic implants will be fabricated via indirect and direct processing routes using rapid prototyping (solid freeform fabrication) technique. Novel three-dimensional honeycomb structures with controlled interconnected porosity and desired shapes will be fabricated.  Pore size, pore distribution and total pore volume will be varied to study their effects on tissue ingrowth and biomechanical properties using in-vitro testing in simulated body fluids. Undergraduate and graduate students will be educated through hands-on research experience in advanced processing and manufacturing.  Local junior/senior high school students will be recruited every summer to participate in the project under an outreach program.  \r\n     The project is expected to make significant advance of the current knowledge on rapid prototyping of ceramics for bioengineering applications. This knowledge will directly benefit selective college and high-school student through the project's education effort.\r\n\r\n",
