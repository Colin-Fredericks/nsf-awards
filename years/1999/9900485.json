Their research involves the development of probabilistic models of diagnostic reasoning and testing of new algorithms developed by the US investigator. Both groups are concerned with performance improvement of robots through error identification and failure recovery.  The investigators propose that iterative performance will improve by embedding abductive reasoning in the robot's environment.  \r\n\r\nThe US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in schema-based abduction, a form of causal reasoning, which employs Bayesian Networks as the underlying representation.  This is complemented by the Edinburgh group's expertise in intelligent systems and takes advantage of learning experiments utilizing their NOMAD robot.  Collaboration with the Edinburgh group provides an opportunity to study the cognitive plausibility of the US investigator's proposed model of diagnostic reasoning.\r\n",
