 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this research is to derive a molecular evolutionary history of Madagascar's extinct giant lemurs using DNA from the maternally-inherited mitochondrion (mtDNA).  The subfossil lemurs represent extremes in body size and morphology and are thus evolutionary enigma.  All of the species to be included in the study have been extinct for approximately 1000 years, leaving only their skeletalremains for scholarly analysis.  Recent studies have shown that if the preservational environment has been favorable, DNA often persists for many thousands of years and can be retrieved for phylogenetic analysis.  These \"ancient DNA\" techniques will be employed to generate mtDNA sequence data from two protein-coding genes (cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase subunit II) and from the mitochondrial control region (D-loop).  The acquired sequences will be analyzed both as separate data sets and as a combined mtDNA data set.  As a long-term goal, the genetic data will be combined with morphological data and analyzed with maximum parsimony.  This strategy for phylogenetic resolution has proven to be highly informative for extant Malagasy primates and thus promises similar resolution for the extinct taxa.  \r\n\r\nThe results of the study will be significant for reconstructing the biogeographic history of Madagascar as well as for understanding morphological and ecological evolution in one of the world's most diverse assemblages of mammals.  Moreover, the technical challenges and successes specific to this study will add to the growing body of knowledge germane to ancient DNA methods.  Preliminary activity has demonstrated that intrinsic DNA, though highly-fragmented, exists in sufficient quantities to be extracted, amplified, and sequenced in many if not all subfossil lemurs. The legitimacy of these data has been confirmed in an independent laboratory.  Most significantly, the promise of clear evolutionary resolution is evident from analysis of these preliminary data.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
