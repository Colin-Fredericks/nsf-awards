 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, applies surface science methods to the investigation of the detailed mechanisms of hydrocarbon reactions on platinum and nickel surfaces.  Professor Francisco Zaera and his coworkers at UC-Riverside use photon and electron induced excitation of precursor molecules to prepare important surface intermediates.  Isothermal kinetic studies of surface reactions are carried out, and work is focussed on the effects of weakly bound intermediates in hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reactions.  Structure-activity correlations are being made, and differences in behavior between various transition metals that catalyze these reactions are examined. \r\n\r\nAn understanding of the detailed mechanisms of the addition and removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons catalyzed by platinum and nickel surfaces is the focus of this research project.  Preparation of transient intermediates and weakly adsorbed species which may be involved in these reactions helps to provide detailed mechanistic information for these reactions.  Fundamental knowledge about surface reaction mechanisms and rates is central to the development of new and better catalytic materials.\r\n\r\n",
