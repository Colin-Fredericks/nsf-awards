Until recently, scientists have had to rely on the scant fossil evidence available from just a few known species of the Mesozoic Era to draw conclusions about the historical relationships of early birds.  Lately, however, the situation has changed dramatically with the discovery of many new Mesozoic bird species.  A wealth of new evidence is now available for analysis and interpretation.  This project will include a comprehensive genealogical study of all available species of early birds.  It will include anatomical studies of species including some as yet undescribed, and build upon existing genealogical analyses of early birds. The work will yield new hypotheses of relationships for all species of early birds (approximately 40 so far known).\r\n",
