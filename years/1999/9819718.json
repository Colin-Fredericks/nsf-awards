 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Stewart E. Novick of Wesleyan University will study free radicals using pulsed-beam Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy (FTM).  Detailed spectral line positions and structures will be determined for a number of carbon-based radicals containing acetylenic groups, including C5H3, various radical isomers of C4H5, two isocyanide radicals C3N and C5N, as well as the phenyl radical, C6H5.  Vibrationally excited states of weakly bound non-radical complexes as well as weakly bound complexes of pure carbon chains produced in these discharges will also be examined.  \r\n\r\nA free radical is a reactive transient molecular species that is highly reactive, elusive, and difficult to produce and to study.  Radicals are important as intermediates in chemical reactions, and many of the interstellar molecules detected by radio astronomy are radicals.  This work therefore has a direct impact on likely candidates for radio astronomical detection.  In addition, it may impact other fields where the presence of radicals is important, such as in understanding the mechanisms of combustion.\r\n",
