Real time, in situ experiments which determine the type, quantity, and energy of gas-phase species during thermal and plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) are the focus of the research activities. The aim is to progress toward a mechanistic understanding of how gas-phase species interact with a surface in thin film growth. Molecular beam mass spectrometry will be used to analyze gas-phase species during thermal and plasma CVD reactions. The quantity of gas-phase neutral, ion, and radical species, and their kinetics and mechanisms, will be correlated with CVD process variables and film properties. The chemical system chosen for these studies is the thermal and plasma-enhanced CVD of Ti-Si-N ternary diffusion barriers, which are candidates for future metallization technology in semiconductor devices. Chemical precursors include tetrakis(diethylamido)titanium and TiI4 as titanium sources, silane and disilane for silicon sources, ammonia and hydrazine as N sources.\r\nThe education aspect involves the design and implementation of a new upperclassmen/first-year graduate student laboratory-based course on Materials Synthesis/Processing and Characterization. The course features three concurrent, semester long, inquiry-based laboratory projects drawn from industrial interactions and current research in materials science. Students are required to formulate, implement, and defend research objectives. The course will have an interdisciplinary enrollment from chemistry, physics, and engineering. The course has dedicated equipment including: differential scanning calorimeter, thermal gravimetric analyzer, dynamic mechanical analyzer, gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer, gel permeation chromatograph, four-point conductivity probe, powder/thin film x-ray diffractometer, sputtering system, and a CVD reactor.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic materials and advanced devices/circuits. The scope of the project will expose students to challenges in materials synthesis, processing and characterization. An important feature of the program is the emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and education.\r\n***\r\n",
