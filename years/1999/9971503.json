Each equivalent class is characterized by a distinct state of matter.  Some of the better known examples include Fermi liquid; superconductor and superfluid; band, Mott and Anderson insulator; and, quantum Hall liquid.  A simple theoretical model can be used to represent an equivalent class as long as it captures the qualitative aspects of the corresponding state of matter.  Through the study of these models one can build up a set of \"fixed points\" which serve as the basis for future understanding of nature.  The objective of this theoretical research is to understand all of the current equivalent classes and discover new ones.  Among the projects to be undertaken:\r\n\r\nWhat are the manifestations of strong correlation in the optical properties of Mott-Hubbard systems?\r\n\r\nIs the half-filled Landau level a new state of matter, and what is the relation between the recently developed neutral fermion theory and the composite Fermi  liquid theory?\r\n\r\nWhat does one learn from the I-V characteristic of edge tunneling in strong magnetic fields?\r\n\r\nWhy is the Josephson effect in superfluid 3He so different from that of superconductors?\r\n\r\nThese efforts, and others, will be closely coordinated with ongoing experiments.\r\n%%% \r\nThis grant supports theoretical research, closely coordinated with experiments, on a wide variety of strongly interacting states of matter.  Common characteristics will be investigated in each state, with the expectation of discovering new states of matter, in addition to gaining a deeper understanding of existing states.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
