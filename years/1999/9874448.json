 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nNuclear receptor complexes have long been known as ligand-activated transcription factors.  Recent cell culture work strongly suggests that nuclear receptor dimers can act negatively as well as positively on a single promoter.  Nuclear receptor-mediated repression depends on nuclear receptor co-repressors which bind to ligand free nuclear receptor dimers.  These co-repressors are displaced by ligand, removing repression, and allowing activating factors to bind.\r\n\r\nIn order to study the in vivo role of nuclear receptors and their co-repressor partners, experiments will examine the role of RXR-containing dimers in the regulation of cell fate, differentiation and the coordination of development, using the Drosophila eye as an experimentally amenable system.  To allow genetic, developmental and molecular approaches to the problem, in the context of otherwise normal development, experiments focus on the role of ultraspiracle (usp), the Drosophila RXR, in control of morphogenetic furrow movement and the earliest stages of cellular differentiation in the eye.\r\n\r\nThe developing Drosophila eye offers an excellent model to study an RXR-mediated activation/repression system.  The eye primordium is marked by a visible constriction, the morphogenetic furrow, separating the posterior and anterior regions.  The morphogenetic furrow moves from posterior to anterior across the primordium.  Cells in the anterior region are undifferentiated and have not committed to any particular fate.  In the posterior cell commitment and differentiation occur in a reproducible and stereotypical manner.\r\n\r\nNormal movement of the morphogenetic furrow and normal differentiation posterior to the furrow require the function of ultraspiracle.  In the absence of ultraspiracle, the furrow moves more quickly than normal and cell commitment in the posterior occurs more rapidly.  These phenotypes suggest repression by ultraspiracle-containing dimers and the possibility of both relief of repression and activation near or within the morphogenetic furrow.  A candidate co-repressor is expressed in the eye.\r\n\r\nWork will be directed at the role of usp, its dimerization partners and co-repressor partners in the control of furrow movement and post-furrow differentiation.  Experiments will test the independence of pre-furrow and post-furrow functions of usp as well as specifically addressing the mechanism of anterior repression and the possibility and mechanism of ligand-induced activation within the morphogenetic furrow.  The most likely nuclear receptor partner for repression and activation by usp will be tested for function in this system using in vitro produced dominant mutations.\r\n\r\nThe high degree of similarity between the regulatory systems operating in the Drosophila eye development and in mammalian limb, heart, eye and nervous system makes it extremely likely that the results of these studies will give insight into multiple processes in other organisms.",
