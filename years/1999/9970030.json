The complex \r\nirreducible characters of a finite group G separate \r\nnaturally into blocks with respect to any prime p dividing the \r\norder of G. Each such character has a defect, which depends only \r\non the power of p dividing the degree of that character. \r\nIn 1992 the principal investigator of this project formulated a conjecture \r\nrelating the number of characters with a fixed defect in a fixed \r\nblock of G to the numbers of characters with the same defect in \r\nrelated blocks of certain p-local subgroups of G. This conjecture, \r\nif true, would imply several other important conjectures about \r\nblocks of group characters. Furthermore, a very strong form of it \r\nwould hold for all finite groups G if it held whenever G is \r\nsimple. Since the finite simple groups have been classified, this \r\ngives some hope of proving a number of major conjectures about \r\ncharacters of arbitrary finite groups by verifying this one \r\nstrong conjecture for all blocks of finite simple groups. This \r\nverification for any given group involves a long, delicate calculation. \r\nIt has been carried out in detail by several people for a large number of \r\nindividual simple groups and a few infinite families of such groups. So \r\nfar it has always proved to be correct. We hope it will continue to do \r\nso.\r\n\r\nGroups in mathematics grew out of the notion of symmetry. We regard \r\nthe symmetries of any object in physics, chemistry or mathematics as \r\ntransformations of that object onto itself preserving all relevant \r\nproperties of the object. Then the composition of two such symmetries is \r\nagain a symmetry of the object. So is the inverse of any symmetry. In \r\nmathematical terms, this means that the symmetries form a group. This \r\nsymmetry group is an important invariant of the object, and is much \r\nstudied. In quantum mechanics, differential geometry and algebraic number \r\ntheory the relations of this group with other invariants of the object are \r\noften expressed using representations of the group by complex matrices, \r\none for each element of the group, which behave under multiplication as \r\nthe corresponding group elements do under composition. When the group is \r\nfinite, such representations are completely determined by their \r\ncharacters, which are the functions mapping each group element into the \r\ntrace of the corresponding matrix. The relations between finite groups \r\nand their characters have fascinated mathematicians for over a hundred \r\nyears. While many of the rules governing such characters are known, \r\nexamination of examples suggests that other rules exist. There are many \r\nconjectures about such rules, but they tantalize us by remaining beyond \r\nour powers of proof.\r\n",
