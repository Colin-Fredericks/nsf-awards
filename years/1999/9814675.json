 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this study the researchers consider a large population of mobile stations which are interconnected by a multihop wireless net. The applications of this wireless infrastructure range from ad hoc networking (eg, collaborative, distributed computing) to disaster recovery (fire, flood, earthquake), law enforcement (eg, crowd control), search and rescue and battlefield.  Key characteristics of this system are the large number of users, their mobility and the ability to operate without the support of a fixed (wired or wireless) infrastructure.  The last feature sets this system apart from existing cellular systems and in fact makes its design much more challenging.\r\n\r\nIn this environment, the researchers propose to develop routing and multicast strategies which scale well to a large number of nodes and which can handle mobility.  The combination of large number and mobility makes the problem very hard.  In fact, large networks can be effectively handled with hierarchical routing, if nodes are stationary.  When nodes move, the hierarchical partitioning must be dynamically changed - a significant challenge.  Mobile IP solutions work well when there is a fixed infrastructure supporting the concept of fixed \"Home Agent\".  When all nodes move, the Home Agent strategy is less obvious. In addition to large number and mobility, we address also the need to support multimedia communications, with low latency requirements for\r\ninteractive traffic and QoS support for real time streams (voice/video).\r\n\r\nIn the wireless routing area, several schemes have already been proposed and implemented (eg, hierarchical routing, on-demand routing etc). The researchers will discuss the pro's and con's of the existing schemes, and will introduce two new schemes - hierarchical, mobile routing and Fisheye routing - which overcome some of the limitations of the existing schemes.  In the wireless multicast area, we review the traditional schemes used in wireline networks (eg, Source Trees, Core Based Tree, etc) and show how they perform poorly in highly mobile networks. We then introduce a new concept, Forwarding Group Multicast, in which the Tree is replaced by a mesh of Forwarding Nodes - the latter being much easier to maintain than the tree in the face of mobility. The researchers propose to extend the on-demand routing strategy to such structure to handle large scale.\r\n\r\n",
