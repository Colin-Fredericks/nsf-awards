 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to study laws for continuum mechanics, describing the conservation\r\nor balance of physical quantities such as mass, momentum, energy, etc. The\r\nmathematical description of those laws are complicated nonlinear systems of\r\npartial differential equations. The systems contain certain terms representing\r\nthe dissipative mechanism such as viscosity, heat conduction, frictional damping,\r\nrelaxation, species diffusion, etc. On one hand, the nonlinearity of the systems\r\ntends to generating singularities (shock waves) in the flows. On the other hand,\r\nthe dissipative mechanism eases such a tendency, but gives rise to richer wave\r\npatterns at the same time. The overall behavior of the flows then depends on\r\nthe competition between the two. The difficulty of the problem lies in the fact\r\nthat the dissipation exists only in certain equations (laws) of a system. For\r\ninstance, physics dictates that the conservation of mass should not have any\r\ndissipation. Such a fact then further complicates the competition between\r\nnonlinearity and dissipation. In different wave directions, one or the other\r\ndominates. It is then easy to understand that in general there is no explicit\r\nformula for a solution. In fact, even the existence of a solution can be an open\r\nquestion. In this project, the awardee will study when a solution can\r\nexist all the time. Furthermore, if a solution exists all the time, what is\r\nits qualitative behavior? To this aim, the awardee will first reduce the system\r\ninto a set of simplified, decoupled equations. Each of them represents a wave\r\nalong a particular direction, and can be solved explicitly. These waves together\r\ngive the time asymptotic wave pattern of the original system. Next, the awardee\r\nwill study how well the asymptotic solution approximates the actual solution.\r\nThrough such a study, the understanding of the underlying physical phenomena can\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\nThe problems addressed in this research can be illustrated by an example. \r\nWhen a space shuttle returns to the earth, the temperature of the air \r\naround it becomes so high that the internal structure of the molecules in the air \r\ngets excited, and chemical reactions occur. The air then loses its local thermodynamic \r\nequilibrium state. The departure from equilibrium in turn provides the ``driving force\" for \r\ninternal changes. The air relaxes towards its local equilibrium state through\r\nmolecular collisions. Such relaxation processes have significant influence in\r\nthe acoustic directions, but not the particle path direction. The awardee\r\nwill study how the relaxation processes change the overall behavior of\r\nthe air flow in this situation.\r\n\r\n",
