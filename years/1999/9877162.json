 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peter Armentrout of the University of Utah is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies of gas phase organometallic ion chemistry and chemical dynamics, utilizing the techniques of flowing afterglow ion production and guided ion beam mass spectrometry.   Detailed kinetic and thermodynamic data will be obtained by accurate measurement of absolute reaction probabilities at thermal and hyperthermal energies.  Experiments will focus on reactions of atomic and partially-ligated metal ions with a range of neutral reagents, emphasizing heavier (second and third row) transition metals.   The characterization of the changing effects of spin-orbit coupling on the chemistry as transition metal centers get heavier is of particular interest.  Studies of the effects of sequential ligations on the thermochemistry and reactivity of metal centers will be performed as well.  The outcomes from this work are expected to permit better correlations between the detailed information available from gas phase studies and condensed-phase organometallic and catalytic reactions where coordinatively unsaturated transition metal centers are known to be key intermediates.  \r\n\r\nLearning about trends in the energy that is evolved or required to carry out chemical reactions is important for understanding and predicting a wide range of chemical behavior.  The thermochemical database that is established with the outcomes of this research has useful impacts in chemical catalysis and organometallic chemistry in condensed phases, with broad industrial implications. \r\n",
