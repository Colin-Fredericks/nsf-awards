The grant supports the development, testing and dissemination of web-based courseware derived primarily from research carried out by the Department of Energy ASCI Alliance Center on Simulation of Accidental Fires and Explosions (C-SAFE) at the University of Utah.  The courseware is being developed in conjunction with Northern Arizona University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute as dissemination sites.  Thus, the course material is being utilized by three very different undergraduate audiences: (1) a Research 1 institution, (2) a private institution whose primary mission is undergraduate education, and (3) a four-year institution serving a significant Native American student population.   It is expected that the courseware, combined with research activity, both at the University of Utah and at the national labs, will create a national center for large-scale simulation science and education.\r\n",
