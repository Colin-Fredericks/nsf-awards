Wood\r\n\r\nThis award will support outside speakers in the Connecticut Logic\r\nSeminar, which usually meets at Wesleyan University and draws\r\nparticipants from New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.  The\r\nseminar provides a forum for recent work in a wide range of\r\nlogical topics, including model theory, set theory, recursion\r\ntheory, proof theory, and computer science.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the number of connections between logic and other\r\nparts of mathematics has increased, as evidenced by applications\r\nof model theory in algebra, number theory, and analytic function\r\ntheory.  This has resulted in attendance at the seminar by\r\nresearchers from areas outside logic, a trend which the\r\norganizers expect to continue and plan to foster by including\r\nspeakers whose work is of broad interest.  Speakers and\r\nparticipants include representatives of every career stage, from\r\ngraduate students through distinguished senior leaders, and past\r\neditions of the seminar have led to new collaborations between\r\nresearchers and shaped the training and theses of graduate\r\nstudents.\r\n",
