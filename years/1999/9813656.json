This is a joint science program between the Arctic Natural Sciences Program,  the Office of Naval Research and the operational Navy. SCICEX 99 will be the sixth cruise in this program. The initial SCICEX submarine cruises to the Arctic Ocean have provided a much more detailed view of the geographic distributions of Arctic Ocean properties than has been recorded previously. This project will address the respiration of organic matter in the basins of the Arctic Ocean and the extent to which this carbon is redistributed beneath Arctic ice. The permanent Arctic ice cover profoundly alters biological and chemical conditions. The ice both restricts the light available for the creation of organic matter, as well as prevents much of the respiration signal in surface waters from re-equilibrating with the atmosphere. These unusual conditions create a situation in which the flux of carbon in this basin may be dominated by horizontal processes. Samples obtained from the 1996 cruise of the USS Pogy provided a geographically broad and coherent data set for the major variables in the ocean carbon system: the dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon pools as well as the particulate carbon (PC) pool. In addition, the submarine mapped oxygen distributions in the surface waters of each basin, providing important evidence as to where the respiration of organic matter occurs in the Arctic. The comparison of these variables in the Canada, Makarov, Amundsen and Nansen basins are now underway with fall data from the SCICEX-96 cruise. The sampling program in 1999 will gather analogous information in the late spring months and extend coverage into the waters near the Canadian Archipelago. These measurements will be critical to sort out the importance of locally produced versus advected respiration signals as well as to determine how much of the large amount of organic matter that enters the Arctic from rivers escapes remineralization. Such rates are critical for understanding the Arctic's role in the carbon cycle of the ocean and atmosphere.\r\n",
