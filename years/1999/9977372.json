 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nBrown\r\n\r\n    The Mathematics Department and the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University will undertake a program of integration of research and education, supported by a grant from the NSF VIGRE Program. We will develop activities on the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral level which will strengthen and provide better coordination for the mathematical sciences program of the two departments. Through the participation and support of the members of the Mathematics and Applied Mathematics departments, in particular VIGRE Postdoctoral Instructors, VIGRE Graduate Trainees and Brown undergraduates, our program will forge scientific communication and research interaction between participants at all levels of mathematical experience and seniority. \r\n    The VIGRE program is an opportunity for the Mathematics Department and the Division of Applied Mathematics to review and reshape their graduate and undergraduate programs, responding to changes in the discipline, research priorities and the evolving landscape of career opportunities for Mathematics degree holders with experience in research.  We plan to rethink our programs, broaden their scope and deepen their contributions to graduate education, without enlarging the size of the mathematical sciences program at Brown.  Our main objectives are to develop innovative activities in our programs which will serve (1) to provide modes of scientific interaction between practicing research mathematicians and students of mathematics at all levels, (2) to give our graduate and undergraduate students more in-depth contact with areas and material of current research interest, and (3) to produce graduate students who are more scientifically literate and more articulate, and who possess the basic skills for a wider range of career possibilities after completing their degree.\r\n\r\n    This program will support 12 graduate students as VIGRE graduate trainees (GTs), 3 VIGRE postdoctoral fellows (VPs) and up to 12 undergraduate research projects (UTRAs) at a time.  These resources will be shared equally between the two mathematics departments as described below.  The VIGRE program at Brown will consist of the following components:\r\n   (1)  a graduate traineeship program (GTs)\r\n   (2)  an undergraduate tutoring and research program (UTRAs)\r\n   (3)  a postdoctoral fellowship program (VPs)\r\n   (4)  support for a mentoring program for women in sciences (WiSE) and under-represented minorities in sciences (ExSEL)\r\n   (5)  a graduate and peer tutoring resource center in mathematics for undergraduates (MRC)\r\n   (6)  a program of outreach to gifted high school students at local area high schools\r\n   (7)  a program of outreach for disadvantaged high school students, resumed education students and their teachers\r\n   (8)  a program of internships with industry and with the National\r\n        Laboratories\r\n\r\n    Graduate Traineeships (GTs) sponsored by VIGRE are opportunities for students to complete a graduate education in mathematics in a stimulating and research productive  environment, with a balanced number of research and teaching semesters, and with adequate summer support.  Postdoctoral Fellows (VPs) will have the opportunity to work closely in research groups, with reduced teaching load and with close contact with both senior faculty and graduate students.\r\nPrincipal features of the graduate, undergraduate and postdoctoral programs include:\r\n   (1)  A series of VIGRE graduate seminars, modeled on the example of a 'literature seminar' and/or a 'lab meeting' that is common in experimental sciences.\r\n   (2)  Additional advanced graduate/research level seminars, on a broad set of current topics in mathematics and applied mathematics.\r\n   (3)  A seminar course series in the graduate program focusing on scientific communication and effective mathematics instruction.\r\n   (4)  A focus on individual undergraduate research activities (UTRAs), directed by faculty and VIGRE Postdoctoral fellows.\r\nResources for these activities will come both from the VIGRE program grant and from an increased level of coordination and cooperation between the Mathematics Department and the Division of Applied Mathematics.\r\n      Graduate Trainees supported by VIGRE will expect support for five years of study, and teach between two and four semesters during their tenure at Brown.  They will also participate in the VIGRE activities outside of their usual course work, which they will be directly involved in coordinating.  Activities involving undergraduates include (1) UTRA research seminars, (2) mentoring activities with the WiSE women in sciences undergraduate support group, and with the ExSEL minority sciences support group, and (3) organization and participation in the MRC, mathematics drop-in resource centers for undergraduates. Activities which involve the local community include (4) participation in outreach programs to Providence area schools, aimed both for gifted and for disadvantaged students and for teachers, and programs in community continuing education centers.\r\nGraduate Trainees will be encouraged to broaden their scientific background, past the confines of their particular research specialization and across department boundaries.  In particular the VIGRE program intends to make the interface at Brown between Mathematics and Applied Mathematics substantially more permeable.  Furthermore, there will be regular programs of summer internships with industry and national labs.\r\nVIGRE Postdoctoral Fellows will benefit from the strong research environment in both the programs in mathematics and applied mathematics, and they will be expected to contribute to the VIGRE graduate seminars.  They will be required to teach one course each semester that they are on campus.  They will also have opportunities to collaborate with research staff at national labs and in industry, and they are expected to benefit from communication with the Brown departments of Chemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, and the campus-based group in cognition (computer and natural vision, artificial and natural intelligence).\r\nObjectives:   We intend to provide our finishing PhDs with a broader view of mathematics and science, with perspective on the relationship of their particular discipline within it.  They should be aware and prepared for the many possible careers both in and outside of academia that are open to degree holders with mathematics research experience.  Graduate students will receive training in scientific communication and in mathematics instruction.  We intend to increase the quality of our incoming graduate classes, through a focussed identification and recruitment program, and to increase the proportion of women and under represented minority students in our program.  The Brown VIGRE program will pay particular attention to the problem of retention of these students. VIGRE resources will increase the number of research support semesters for participants, and as a result we expect to lower the average time to degree. We intend to produce better prepared undergraduate mathematics concentrators, who already have some research experience, many of whom are expected to go on to graduate school and subsequently a career in the mathematical sciences. We expect our VIGRE Postdoctoral Fellows to have an additional competitive advantage in the academic job market, from the breadth of their research experience at Brown, from the increased opportunity for collaborative research, from the availability of contacts with industry and national labs, and from the focus on instruction and communication of mathematics, and their experience teaching at a high quality undergraduate institution.\r\nImpact:  We expect that we will be able to increase the numbers of American undergraduate majors in mathematics, and to increase the subset of the pool which goes on to graduate school in mathematics.  We expect to increase the proportion of Am",
