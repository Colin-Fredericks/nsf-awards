The similarity between two objects is represented with a distance metric.  Two existing approaches for handling similarity search are addressed.  The first is based on mapping to low-dimensional geometric space (making use of data structures such as the R-tree), while the second directly indexes the objects based on distances (making use of data structures such as the M-tree).  For both approaches, the development of new incremental algorithms for nearest neighbor search are being investigated.  The algorithms will have the property of reporting their result one-by-one in order of\r\nsimilarity, with as little effort as possible expended to produce each new result object.  The incremental aspect provides significant benefits in situations when the number of desired neighbors is unknown in advance.  The application of the algorithms to problems in fields such as multimedia databases, medical application, as well as others, are being investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
