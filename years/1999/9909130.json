 "awd_abstract_narration": "Machining involves very extreme physical phenomena that occur over a wide range of time and length scales.  This has hindered progress in predictive modeling of machining processes.  Many different types of models ranging from theoretical to empirical have been developed, but the wide variety of the models makes inter-comparison difficult. Better predictive models of manufacturing processes could enable manufacturers to: (1) eliminate or reduce empirical testing when developing new manufacturing process plans for new products; (2) improve understanding of the physical limitations of processes; (3) reduce variability of performance; and (4) allow operations to be performed more aggressively. The goal of this project is to provide a clear, consistent, well-measured and relevant data set, and use that data set to benchmark the predictive capability of machining models.  The project will involve four participating laboratories from Ford, General Motors, NIST and Caterpillar. These labs will generate machining data, and machining modeling research groups will be invited to make predictions of the generated data.  The predictions will be collected and compared to the experiments, and the results will be disseminated broadly to the research community.  A workshop based on the effort will then be held at NIST, and a roadmap for future research in modeling will be developed.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this effort could enable manufacturers to identify means to more accurate prediction of tool wear in turning processes, resulting in significant cost savings for the machining operation.  Companies will no longer need to use conservative settings and conservative tool-change policies when machining.  \r\n",
