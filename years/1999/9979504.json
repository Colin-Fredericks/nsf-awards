 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is using the systemic reform efforts already underway at two schools, under the NSF funded Texas Rural Systemic Initiative (TRSI), as a laboratory for introducing GK-12 fellows to issues of national consequence concerning how students are taught and learn high quality SMET K-12. The Beeville school district, located in South Texas, enrolls 4,305 students and employs 173 mathematics and science teachers K-12: 63% of students are economically disadvantaged and 68% are Hispanic. The Hereford school district, in the Texas Panhandle, enrolls 4,501 students and employs 176 mathematics and science teachers K-12: 61% of the students are economically disadvantaged and 71% are Hispanic, of which over a quarter are from migrant agricultural families. Participants in the program are being immersed in the systemic reform efforts at these two schools. Rural schools are under-served in access to SMET resources and expertise, and often under-served by policy makers on issues of rural education; e.g., resources, geography (distance and isolation), demographics, poverty, and community.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
