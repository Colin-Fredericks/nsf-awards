Fintushel have shown out that there are many more smooth 4-manifolds than previously expected. These examples also indicate that the current technologies, i.e. the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants, are insufficient to provide a classification of smooth 4-manifolds. The goal of this research is to develop new constructions of smooth 4 manifolds in the hope that a general picture begins to emerge.  To begin, there is a conjectured classification (up to blow-up) of (simply-connected) symplectic 4-manifolds; namely they are the fiber sums of holomorphic Lefschetz pencils along holomorphic submanifolds. Surprisingly, most of the new constructions of symplectic 4-manifolds can be shown to be obtained in this manner. The veracity of this conjecture will be the focus of the first part of this proposed research. A very effective method, introduced by the PI and R. Fintushel, which retains the homeomorphism type of a smooth 4-manifold X which contains a homologically essential torus with trivial normal bundle but alters its diffeomorphism type is the \"knot surgery construction\". Here, given a knot K in the 3-sphere, there results a 4-manifold X(K) homeomorphic to X with the following properties: 1) X(unknot)=X, and  2) if X(K) is diffeomorphic to X(J), then the Alexander polynomials of J and K are the same. The second part of this proposal is to better understand the role that the isotopy classes of knots play in this knot construction.   \r\n\r\nWith time included, our world is four dimensional, but the large-scale structure of our four-dimensional space is still unknown. The underlying mathematical issue is to provide a complete list of four-dimensional manifolds; i.e. objects which are locally modeled on Euclidean 4-space. This turns out to be an important unsolved problem in mathematics. Strangely enough, manifolds of dimension larger than 4 are very well understood; yet it is the dimension in which we live and operate that provides major mathematical challenges. Using difficult techniques from analysis, geometry, and topology, the PI and R. Fintushel have developed surgery techniques and workable topological strategies for counting solutions to differential equations (the Yang-Mills and Seiberg Witten equations) which effectively distinguish four-dimensional manifolds. Prior NSF supported research allowed for the construction of an unexpectedly large number of four-manifolds which provided counterexamples to all the conjecture classification schemes. This project will more closely examine these techniques and create new constructions in the hope that a general picture begins to emerge.  \r\n",
