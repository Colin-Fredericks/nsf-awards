To date, the most convincing evidence for a set of climatic oscillations that parallel  the  Bolling/Allerod and Younger Dryas of Europe and North Atlantic comes from the Sajama ice core, Bolivia. A site that lends itself to testing the Sajama record is the nearby  Lake Titicaca. Titicaca is an deep lake with ancient sediments, but one in which a hiatus at 16,000 to 9,000 years ago exists in all previous cores. Core NE98-1PC was raised from 170 m of water and contains  the  first  continuous sedimentary sequence covering  the  last 23,000 years. Other collaborators are working on a wide array  of proxies, and this proposal seeks funds to provide fossil pollen and charcoal data  for this core. These data would  provide  the  first continuous record of vegetation movement, fire,  and  inferred climate change from the Bolivian Altiplano.  Indeed,  they would become one of two or three continuous sedimentary records from the neotropics south of the equator that date to the glacial maximum.\r\n",
