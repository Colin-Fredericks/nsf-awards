 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GK-12 project is a collaborative effort by Vanderbilt University, Meharry Medical College, and the Davidson County Metropolitan School District to enhance 7-12th grade science and technology education through the use of teaching fellows as resource persons for teachers.  Teacher-mentors who are recognized as expert teachers by their peers and supervisors are participants in this program. Twelve graduate and two advanced undergraduate teaching fellows from Vanderbilt and Meharry are participating in the project each year. Faculty members from graduate programs in chemistry, physics, biological sciences (eight departments), chemical engineering, biomedical engineering, and environmental engineering are serving as mentors.  The teaching fellows are assisting the teachers in the implementation of an integrated 7-12th grade science curriculum, as well as helping teachers to match the local core curriculum with national and state science standards. The main objectives for 7-12th grade students are to increase inquiry-based activities, enhance science literacy, develop positive attitudes about science, provide individual attention for students through tutoring and mentoring, and provide role models for students. The objectives for teachers are to increase science content knowledge and the use of computer technology, and enhance communication links between teachers and the learning community.  Goals for teaching fellows include learning how to transform their science knowledge into an appropriate form for understanding by students and teachers (and the general public), and developing an appreciation for the professionalism of teachers.",
