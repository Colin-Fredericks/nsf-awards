 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovatione Research Phase II project from Collaborative Motion Control, Inc. will result in the development of Intelligent Materials Handling systems of a type that complements the physical and sensory capabilities of the human workers who use them.  This technology will bring aspects of robotic control, particularly the interface to computers, to the widely used \"manual assist devices\" which until now have been almost exclusively mechanical.  Building in part on Phase I research results, Collaborative Motion Control is entering into a product development relationship with a major manufacturer in the materials handling industry.  The resulting overhead-rail assist devices will offer simple and effective power-assist and provide ergonomic and productivity benefits.  However these devices will not offer task-level programmability.  Phase II research will add task-level programmability to the new class of assist devices.  Core cobotic components will be further developed and will make possible the implementation of virtual guiding surfaces.\r\n     Commercial applications include automobile assembly, textile mills, food and beverage industry, and the many other segments of the materials handling industry in which human workers are essential, yet physical assistance and computer interface are needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
