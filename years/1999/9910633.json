The field of Computational Geometry has made impressive strides  in the last twenty years in providing an algorithmic foundation  for the solution to many geometric problems in computer graphics,  computer vision, robotics and manufacturing, and many other  application areas. The purpose of this proposal is to develop a  set of novel geometric representations and algorithmic techniques  that will make computational geometry more useful in modeling  physical-world objects and processes. The aim is not to obtain  universal, domain-independent solutions --- such as a complete  solution to robustness concerns in geometric computing. Instead  the focus will be on certain key issues, such as scale-  sensitivity, shape variability, and motion, that arise in many of  the important uses of geometry in modeling physical objects and  systems. Geometric models that properly capture certain key  aspects of the uncertainty or variability in models of physical  objects and processes will be investigated, and efficient  algorithms for manipulating these models effectively will be  developed.  It is expected that this set of research directions  will generate new mathematical and algorithmic problems that will  be interesting and worthy of study on their own right, in  addition to producing geometric tools that are well-tailored to  physical world applications.  ***\t\r\n",
