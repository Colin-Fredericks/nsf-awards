 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an intellectual-historical study of the American social scientist Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929). The focus of the study is the development of Veblen's theoretical, methodological, and social-critical ideas in the early years of his intellectual career. This formative period in Veblen's life has not been subject to systematic historical investigation since Joseph Dorfman's widely-influential, but seriously flawed, study Thorstein Veblen and His America, published in 1934.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the work of Dorfman and the several generations of scholars who have followed him, this study seeks to understand Veblen's intellectual development by locating Veblen in the specific local interdisciplinary contexts in which his ideas took shape, giving particular attention to debates then underway in the biological sciences at the academic institutions where Veblen studied and taught:  Johns Hopkins, Yale, Cornell, and the University of Chicago. Through examination of these contexts, the project seeks to reconstruct the turn-of-the-century intellectual and institutional debates to which Veblen was oriented and, in so doing, to uncover the basic questions that he sought to address in his own work and the various tools (concepts, methods, assumptions) that he employed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nTo reconstruct the debates present in the several local contexts where Veblen's ideas took shape, the study analyzes as fully as possible (for the period preceding and including the years of Veblen's involvement in the these contexts) the published and unpublished writings and correspondence of the social and biological scientists who were active players in these settings, with particular attention to the scientific questions raised in these works, the concepts and methods used to achieve their scientific and institutional aims, their assumptions and points of agreement and disagreement, and the complex relation on these ideas to the development of Veblen's own theoretical, methodological, and social-critical views. Insofar as these contemporary materials are unpublished, the study includes extensive research at several archives in the Midwest and on the East Coast.\r\n\r\nBy situating Veblen in the contexts in which his ideas emerged, the project seeks to challenge the nearly universal claim by Veblen scholars that the heterodox features of Veblen's social thought took shape because he was an \"outsider\" to the academic world of his time. Through an analysis of Veblen's intellectual development, the project also seeks to refine and extend a new perspective on the history of the American social sciences -- a perspective that gives emphasis to contexts that are both local and thoroughly interdisciplinary.",
