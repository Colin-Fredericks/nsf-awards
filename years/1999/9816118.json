The project, by a cultural anthropologist from New York University, will study how race, class and ethnic differences interact to influence the responses of local communities to urban restructuring.  The neighborhoods are Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Carol Gardens/Park Slope, and Red Hook, all located in West Brooklyn yet composed of socially and ethnically diverse populations.  Using participant observation over two years the investigator will examine how the four communities respond to development projects including the siting of a waste-transfer station on the waterfront; the reconstruction of an expressway; the construction of a rail freight tunnel, and the private development of large malls, multiplex cinemas and other private facilities.  The focus of the project will be on the creation of coalitions across racial, cultural and class lines.  This research will provide valuable information on how local sub-communities organize to cooperate over issues of common interest.  The analysis of how such coalitions function will be a valuable corrective to the common view of such urban neighborhoods as unable to construct a civil society because of the inability to cooperate and bridge internal divisions.  The new information to be collected will be of interest to planners and politicians in New York City as well as in other similar urban places.\r\n",
