 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because FT-NMR spectroscopy has become a powerful, routine tool for the elucidation of structure and mechanism in chemistry, it should be a critical component of any undergraduate chemistry program. In order to compete effectively it is imperative that students receive hands-on experience with this valuable technique. A multinuclear high field FT NMR spectrometer is having a vitalizing impact on virtually every chemistry course offered for science majors at our institution. New experiments introduced in our laboratories include: structural isomerism in carboxylic acids; quantitative analysis of amine/alcohols mixtures by 19 F NMR without prior separation; microscopic protonation equilibria of polybasic molecules; T1 s to probe dihydrogen vs. hydride ion bonding in iridium complexes; stereoisomerism in tris(trifluorocetylacetonate) aluminum(III) complexes. \r\n\r\nWe are using a systematic, graduated approach to our students' four-year NMR spectroscopy learning experience. In the first year laboratory, students identify a simple carboxylic acid unknown using an experimental Gram Equivalent Weight in conjunction with their interpretation of the acid's 1 H NMR spectrum. Students are guided to see the differences between isomeric compounds by comparing their experimental results. This NMR spectroscopy-based, experimental excursion into the molecular level gives beginning students a refreshingly modern introduction to chemistry and hopefully attracts talented students to elect further studies in chemistry. The integration of NMR into the undergraduate teaching/ research laboratory draws significantly upon the experience of two NSF projects: NSF-DUE 9351303, NMR in an Integrated Advanced Laboratory; and an RUI-CIP, Acquisition of a High Field NMR Spectrometer. \r\n",
