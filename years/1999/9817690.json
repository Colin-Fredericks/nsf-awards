The urban planning endeavor is complicated by the existence of multiple competing objectives that require trade-offs based on the relative importance of objectives.  However, it is difficult for planners to numerically quantify the relative weight that the public places on each of the objectives.  In this research, a new approach will be taken to search for a set of plans which are pareto-optimal.  The beauty of the pareto set is that it is independent of the relative importances of the objectives.  A non-pareto plan will be noncompetitive regardless of the relative importances of the objectives since a pareto plan exists which is better in every objective.  This project will develop a genetic algorithm to search over millions of plans to obtain a pareto set.  With the computing and modeling power that exists today, urban planners can consider many plans and this approach eliminates the vast number of non-pareto plans from consideration by decision-makers. \r\n\r\nMany of the research ideas were initially developed in a previous NSF-supported project in which a genetic algorithm was used to obtain pareto-optimal urban plans for a single high-growth city in Utah.  There are five goals for this current project:   \r\n   1) obtain pareto plans for a multi-city metropolitan region.  Application to a region (the Wasatch Front metropolitan region) rather than a single city is a significant conceptual leap because regional planning must allow the individual cities to exercise a certain degree of planning autonomy.  A two-level approach will be investigated in which macro-planning occurs at the regional level while micro-planning occurs at the city level.   \r\n   2) expand plans to include additional regional objectives from the human environment.  In addition to minimizing traffic congestion, cost, and change, metrics will be developed for the maximization of affordable housing and the maximization of economic development.   \r\n   3) include regional objectives from the natural environment.  In particular, metrics will be developed for the control of air pollution and the preservation of natural and open spaces in the planning process.   \r\n   4) develop a graphical way in which information from the pareto plans may be assimilated by decision-makers.  The project will use slider-bars and real-time graphics to convey the planning trends in the pareto set that are implied by the various competing objectives.  \r\n   5) develop procedures based on formal decision theory to assist decision-makers in narrowing the pareto set to a final plan or plans. \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
