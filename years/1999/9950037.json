 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project addresses the industry need for information technology technicians with a specialized degree in applied Internet technologies and answers the need for an integrated information technology curriculum that is articulated from high school through the community college to the university level. By expanding the full articulation concept to include an option for dual enrollment, students least-served by higher education have the opportunity to train in this high demand occupation while still attending high school. The project provides in-depth training for high school teachers in this new field so that they, in turn, will be able to provide high school students with appropriate training. In addition, this project provides activities designed to increase high school students' knowledge of information technology careers and training required. The beneficiaries of the project are entering college students, high school teachers, and high school students, the majority of whom are members of minority groups.  \r\n\r\nActivities include curriculum development, development and publication of the guide and manual, development of a dual enrollment course, training for high school teachers, increased knowledge about information technology careers for high school students and evaluation and dissemination of the project.\r\n\r\nProject outcomes include: (I) a series of nine courses for a new A.A.S. degree in Applied Internet Technology, (2) a dual enrollment course with accompanying Instructor's Guide and Student Lab Manual, both with interactive CD-ROM, (3) workshops in technology curriculum development and curriculum delivery using technology, and (4) articulation of the A.A.S. degree to Illinois public universities.",
