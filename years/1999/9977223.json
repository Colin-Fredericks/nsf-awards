 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project is an analysis of the link between the growth of the Cold War aerospace/defense industry and the rise of a distinct and key part of the American suburban middle class. This project's final product will be a historical narrative based on an extensive examination of published and unpublished government and aerospace company documents and the critical recollections and analyses of former aerospace engineers and production workers. More specifically, the project focuses on the impact of the U.S. civil space program on American society, the public and private lives of aerospace engineers and production workers, the effects of state-sponsored science and technology on engineers and technical laborers, the complexities of American middle class identity, the meanings of American patriotism, and the realities of corporate welfarism from the late 1950s through the early 1970s. It is a study of the socioeconomic, cultural, and professional lives of the engineers and production workers of the Grumman Aerospace Corporation's Space Division from the birth of the Space Age in 1957, through their triumphs with the Apollo Lunar Modules and Orbiting Astronomical Observatories during the 1960s and early 1970s, to the company's loss of the space shuttle contract and its layoff of one out of every three employees by the recession of 1973. This project will provide an overview of what aerospace engineers' and production workers' lives were like during the \"glory days\" of the Apollo program and an examination of how a number of Americans personally profited from the Cold War because of their work for the U.S. civil space program. Support for this dissertation research project will facilitate the completion of this project by providing funds to primarily conduct a survey and interviews of  Gumman engineers.",
