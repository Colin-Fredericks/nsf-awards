The main objective of this four-year CAREER project is to design a generic high-quality video-based storage system.  The goals are (1) to search for efficient processing algorithms for the static video file allocation problem, (2) to develop the theoretical framework for dynamic video file allocation problem, (2) to develop the theoretical framework for dynamic video file reallocation and (3) to investigate efficient software design for emerging serial storage interfaces.  A video-based storage system (i.e., middleware solution) with guaranteed application quality over high-speed communication networks is designed.  The research includes both theoretical performance evaluation and measurement through an experimental system.  The integration of research and education is achieved by developing a series of multimedia system design courses and a research laboratory to provide students a facility to design, implement, and test the proposed high-performance video-based storage system over high-sped LANs.\r\n",
