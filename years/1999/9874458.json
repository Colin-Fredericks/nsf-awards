 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall aim of this project is to use the techniques of structural and molecular biology to understand how an enzyme active site can control the chemistry of a bound cofactor, specifically, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP; vitamin b6).  Many enzymes use organic cofactors as partners to assist them in catalyzing chemical reactions;  the dietary requirement for vitamins comes about because these cofactors are derived from vitamins and are essential for the reactions of the enzymes that use them.  PLP is an extraordinarily versatile cofactor: in solution it produces several very different products when it reacts with other molecules.  However, when PLP is bound in the active site of an enzyme its chemistry is directed along one path and only one product is produced.  Somehow, the unique environment provided by the enzyme is able to control the chemistry of PLP.  If we could understand how this control is exerted, we would be closer to one of the central aims  in all studies of catalysis: how to get the right product from a reaction.  \r\nWe have selected several PLP utilizing enzymes for study.  They react with the same or very similar substrates, but produce completely different products in each case.  To understand the mechanisms by which this occurs, we will determine the three-dimensional structures of these enzymes by high resolution x-ray diffraction.  Then we will determine structures for complexes of these enzymes with substrate analogs.  From these studies we will formulate hypotheses for the roles of protein residues in the active site that interact with cofactor (PLP) or substrates.  These hypotheses can be tested by using the techniques of molecular biology to change these residues into others; the properties of the mutant proteins produced in this way will help us refine our hypotheses.  Finally, we hope to be able to change one type of PLP enzyme into another, thereby showing that we really have learned the rules for the control of cofactor chemistry.\r\n\r\n",
