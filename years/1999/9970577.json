(1) Study of Monge-Kantorovich\r\nmass transfer problem in nonhomogeneous media, which include transport\r\non manifolds with obstacles, and in anisotropic and nonsmooth spaces.\r\nAlso, related evolution problems will be studied. Recently a progress was \r\nmade by many authors in studying mass transport in the Euclidean space. \r\nNonhomogeneous media is a natural next step. (2) Study of existence of\r\nconvex viscosity solutions of geometric evolution equations, including \r\nnonlocal curvature motion, in the spatial dimensions three and higher. \r\nSuch geometric evolutions are related to Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer. \r\n(3) Free boundary problems: existence and stability of solutions, and \r\nregularity of free boundaries.\r\n\r\nMethods of mass transfer theory were used recently in several applications \r\nincluding mathematical models in economics, meteorology, fluid dynamics, \r\nsandpiles growth and collapse, non-Newtonian fluids, plasticity. Free \r\nboundaries and moving interfaces arise naturally in many models.\r\nMathematical analysis of such problems improves our understanding of \r\nqualitative properties of models, and is a necessary ingredient in \r\ndeveloping of fast and reliable numerical algorithms. In addition, \r\nmathematical study sometimes discovers unexpected connections between \r\ndifferent models (for example, partial differential equations and transport \r\nproblems), and such interplay is useful in applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
