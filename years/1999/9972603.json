 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to compare the food mechanics, and food processing behavior of tufted capuchins (Cebus apella) and weeper capuchins (Cebus olivaceus) at the Iwokrama Rainforest Reserve, Guyana.  Capuchins are New World monkeys ranging from Central to southern South America.  The genus Cebus exhibits two distinct morphological types; the tufted or \"robust\" type consisting of a single species and three species of  untufted or \"gracile\" types, including C. olivaceus, the species of interest to this study.  The tufted type is noted for its more \"robust\" and powerful masticatory system.  However, little is known regarding differences in the mechanical properties of foods eaten by each species and how such differences relate to capuchin anatomy.  The main objectives of this study are to collect behavioral data on species differences in patterns of food preparation and processing (manual and oral), and detailed seasonal data on the physical properties of the foods they ingest. \r\n     The study of ecomorphological distinctions between \"robust\" and \"gracile\" species of extant capuchin offers a unique opportunity to test questions concerning variability in the feeding ecology of other \"robust\" and \"gracile\" primates such as extinct primates in human ancestry.  This is due not only to the masticatory similarities they share with early human-like ancestors, but also to the broad set of features they share with great apes and modern humans, such as slow infant development, tool-use in various contexts, and the largest relative brain size of any primate except humans.  In addition, research concerning the relationship between the mechanical properties of foods and the masticatory systems of primates has seen growing interest over the last decade.  Data on differences in masticatory morphology and on the mechanical properties of available fruits and seeds have provided critical insight into species-specific differences in anatomy and feeding ecology.  This project will add to this knowledge by identifying more discrete mechanical categories for foods, and by relating these categories to more subtle morphological differences between congeneric primate species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
