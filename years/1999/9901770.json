 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop and commercialize a unique class of  laser and nonlinear optical crystals for application in telecommunications, materials processing, optical computing, medicine, and food safety.  The goals of the Phase I Program were met, and as a result, a promising class of materials with many potential commercial applications was developed.  In Phase I the feasibility of the approach was demonstrated by identifying crystal-growth procedures for several derivatives, evaluating their crystal structures, and studying their optical properties.  Finally, we modeled their optical properties and predicted performance as both laser-host and NLO materials.  As a result, we have identified the following candidate materials for further development in a Phase II program.  The objective of the Phase II program is to apply the knowledge gained in Phase I to further develop crystal growth procedures to produce crystals of quality for incorporation into prototype devices, in preparation for Phase III commercializertion.  We believe that a new class of optical products will be developed with significant commercial potential.\r\n\tSuccessful completion of the Phase II Program will lead to the development and commercialization of a unique class of laser and nonlinear optical crystals for application in telecommunications, materials processing, optical computing, medicine, and food safety.\r\n\r\n",
