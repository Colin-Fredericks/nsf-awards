Technical\r\n\r\nThis work involves a combined research and education initiative aimed at\r\nthe development of structure-based models of biological function, which can\r\nbe used as research tools in biochemistry and cell biology labs as well as\r\nin structural and biophysical labs.  The research component involves the\r\ndevelopment and experimental validation of an ensemble-based description of\r\nmolecular recognition.  This computational model, which will provide a\r\nquantitative link between structure and energy, will be tested and refined\r\nby comparison to the experimentally determined thermodynamic parameters for\r\nthe binding of the Src-homology-3 (SH3) domain  SEM5 with numerous variants\r\nof its putative peptide ligand, Sos.  The resultant ensemble-based view\r\nshould not only provide the structural and thermodynamic origins of the\r\naffinity, it should allow access to the determinants of specificity as\r\nwell.  As the model is intended to be used as a research tool for deriving\r\nhypothesis, interpreting results, and directing research efforts,  all\r\nelements of this algorithm will be coded into Mathematica  notebooks which\r\ncan be distributed upon request to suitably equipped labs both within UTMB\r\nand outside of the University.  The education component involves developing\r\na Mathematica-based curriculum in the Department of Human Biological\r\nChemistry and Genetics (HBC&G).  In addition to the co-development of a\r\nMathematica -based syllabus for three courses, the education plan centers\r\naround introductory courses for students and faculty, wherein students (and\r\nfaculty) are taught various strategies for incorporating computational\r\napproaches in their own research.\r\n\r\n2. Non-technical\r\n\r\nRecent advances in computer technology, coupled to the near exponential\r\ngrowth of biological databases have spawned the rapidly growing field of\r\nbioinformatics.  From within this emerging field, numerous computational\r\nefforts have focused on integrating different types of data in tackling\r\ncomplex biological problems.  Indeed, such is the case in this work, where\r\nresearch efforts are centered on integrating the structural (e.g. Protein\r\nData Bank) and thermodynamic databases to derive models for molecular\r\nrecognition, allosterism, and signal transduction.  The task at hand in\r\nthis new computational era in biology is not only to develop the methods\r\nthemselves, but to provide a medium through which these methods can be\r\ndisseminated among groups, and to provide access to strategies for\r\nincorporating these methods in a diverse array of research specialties.\r\nThe goal of this combined research and education initiative is to promote\r\nthe use of these computational approaches by developing useful methods,\r\nimplementing a convenient and accessible medium of interaction (i.e.\r\nMathematica ), and providing students and faculty with training in both the\r\nmethods and the medium.\r\n\r\n",
