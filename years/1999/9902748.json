 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development  of  software  in  OO  languages  has   become   very\r\nwidespread  in  every sphere of computing. On the hardware front,\r\nmultithreaded  high-performance  workstations  and  future   VLIW\r\nmachines  or  SMP  workstations  have  emerged  as  an affordable\r\nalternative  to  distributed  and   parallel   computing.   These\r\nmachines, single- or multi-CPU, are often equipped with operating\r\nsystem supported multithreading and are usually connected through\r\na  communication  network.   This  proposal  intends to develop a\r\nplatform  for  partitioning  and  scheduling  OO   programs   for\r\nconcurrent execution on a multithreaded system. The first step of\r\nproposed work is to perform coarse-grained  program  partitioning\r\nof  the  flow  graph into tasks. We have successfully implemented\r\nsuch an experimental framework for programs written  in  C  using\r\nthe  Unravel flow graph and Metis graph partitioning package. The\r\nnext step of our approach is to build  a  framework  for  runtime\r\nconcurrent  execution  of the partitioned flow graph based on our\r\n>experience of the Threaded-Executor model.   We  plan  to  extend\r\nthis  implementation  to  experiment with our recently introduced\r\nScalable Task Duplication Based Optimal Scheduling Algorithm.  We\r\nalso   propose   to   investigate  opportunities  for  extracting\r\ninstruction  level  parallelism  more   aggressively   for   VLIW\r\narchitectures  as  a result of better static type information and\r\ninterprocedural analysis.\r\n",
