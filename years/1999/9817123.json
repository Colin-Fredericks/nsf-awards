 "awd_abstract_narration": "The activation of signal transduction pathways in response to extracellular signals is a basic mechanism used to regulate the growth and differentiation of cells.  As more is learned about how extracellular signaling pathways regulate cell fate determination it has become clear that in many cases individual cells are receiving input from several signaling pathways at once and that cells must integrate this information in order to differentiate correctly.  How signaling pathways interact at the molecular level and how cells integrate multiple signals are poorly understood processes.  Therefore to better understand how the diversity of animal cell types is generated during animal development, it is essential to understand these processes in more detail.\r\n\r\nDr. Eisemman's laboratory studies the function of extracellular signaling in the induction of the vulva of C. elegans, a process regulated by a Ras signaling pathway.  A mutant screen designed to identify novel factors acting in vulval development has been carried out.  Mutations in the bar-1 locus were identified in this screen and it was shown that bar-1 encodes a  C. elegans homolog of beta-catenin, a protein known to function in Wnt signal transduction pathways.  Further characterization of the bar-1 gene suggested that a Wnt signaling pathway may be functioning during vulval development, and that conserved Wnt and Ras pathways interact during this and other processes in order to regulate the activity of an important class of target genes, the Hox genes.  Therefore, this is an opportunity to investigate at the molecular level how two well-characterized signal transduction cascades interact to control differentiation via the regulation of an important class of transcriptional regulatory molecules, and to pursue this study in a model system that is well suited for genetic and molecular analyses.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to extend the results on the role of Wnt signaling in vulval development, and the interactions of the Wnt and Ras pathways in the regulation of lin-39 Hox activity in the Vulval Precursor cells.  First, he will identify additional factors acting during this process by studying the function of known Wnt pathway components in vulval development, by characterizing a second gene identified in the mutant screen which could be a downstream Wnt pathway target, and by identifying factors which physically interact with the BAR-1 protein.  Second, he will determine the mechanisms by which the Wnt and Ras pathways control the activity of their common downstream target, the homeodomain protein LIN-39, and begin to examine the role of LIN-39 in cell fate specification.  The results from this proposal will extend out knowledge of how these two conserved pathways function in normal development and how cells integrate multiple signaling pathways during development.\r\n",
