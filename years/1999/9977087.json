 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inflorescence architecture, the patterning of reproductive branches, affects fruit and seed yield in natural and agricultural settings.  The diversity of architectural patterns contrasted with the highly conserved nature of essential flowering genes provides an intriguing puzzle for developmental and evolutionary biologists.  Multiple pathways lead to inflorescence development.  An in-depth comparative analysis of several model systems with distinct inflorescence typologies will lead to an understanding of the shared pathways in inflorescence development, as well as the genetic modifications resulting in diversification of inflorescence types.  Pea (Pisum sativum) is a good model system for the comparative analysis of inflorescence development because it has a one-step more complex inflorescence (compound vs. simple raceme) than the extensively studied Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum systems.  Also, homologs of two key flowering genes in Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum have been cloned and have a mutant phenotype in pea:  PFLO[unifoliata (uni)] and PSQUA [proliferating inflorescence meristem (pim-1].  The mutant phenotypes are similar to those in the other systems, but have distinctive effects on the overall architecture of the plant.  Ten genes have been identified that have a primary role in specific regions of the inflorescence.  A model will be constructed explaining how these genes interact with themselves, the environment, and genes that regulate flowering time through the production or control of transport of a floral inhibitor and a floral promoter.  Two genes that regulate inflorescence development will be investigated.  Mutants of COCHLEATA (COCH) affect both vegetative and reproductive growth.  A subtle asymmetry in size and shape of stipule pairs is greatly enhanced in each of the four coch alleles being investigated.  This results in a 'front-back' asymmetry that is inconsistent with a model of leaves being initiated spirally.  COCH is responsible for a graft transmissible factor.  Wild-type scions grafted onto coch mutants develop aberrant flowers similar to those found in the mutants.  Sepal number varies and secondary flowers often form in the axil of the first sepal initiated.  The double mutant coch pim-1 does not flower which is indicative of two partially redundant pathways of flowering.  The role of COCH in regulating shoot architecture will be analyzed by: 1) developmental morphological studies; 2) grafting and tissue culture experiments; 3) investigation of interactions of coch with other flowering mutants and environmental factors; 4) genetic and histological comparisons of the stipules and sepals in coch and COCH plants to assess the relationships between leaves and sepals; 5) investigations of the expression patterns of the PFLO and PSQUA in coch; and 6) testing of the hypothesis that COCH is the homolog of FRUITFULL (FUL) in Arabidopsis, since ful-1 has many phenotypic similarities to coch.  Genes that regulate the number of pods produced by an axillary inflorescence branch will also be characterized.\r\n  Understanding how inflorescence development is regulated has the potential to increase crop yield.\r\n",
