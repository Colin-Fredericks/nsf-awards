 "awd_abstract_narration": "9979331\r\nLevi\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to develop a new class of RF-photonic device for use in power-efficient, small, light-weight, mobile wireless communication applications. These objectives will be achieved at the University of Southern California (USC) by bringing together the needed interdisciplinary expertise in RF-design, photonics, and systems in a university-based effort which leverages resources at the government Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The initial focus of research is realization of efficient RF-to-optical conversion. The research challenges include creation of high-Q microresonators, low-loss optical coupling, and efficient coupling of RF power to microresonators. An initial system-level goal is detection of utW RF power and the demonstration of a wireless receiver using a 60 GHz RF carrier.\r\n\r\nFuture mobile wireless communication devices will operate using RF carrier frequencies in the range 10 GHz to 100 GHz (3.3 cm to 3 mm wavelength). Conventional RF design makes extensive use of electronic mixers and intermediate frequency stages to extract base-band information. Such designs are inherently power hungry due to the large number of components and the lossy electronic RF circuit environment. However, novel, potentially revolutionary, device concepts can have a dramatic influence on how RF signals are received and processed at these frequencies. For example, carrier frequency may be increased from RF to 200 THz (1.5 gm wavelength) by direct conversion to the optical domain. The resulting photonic signals may then be processed in a low-loss, ultra-fast photonic signal-processing environment. An additional advantage of this optical approach is the potential for reduced weight, size and power consumption - all of which scale with photon wavelength.\r\n\r\nEfficient RF to optical conversion is a key challenge. This proposal identifies a solution which involves the intimate integration of high-Q RF and microphotonic components. Recent studies of microsphere and microdisk photonic resonators have shown that Qs exceeding 109 can be achieved in microspheres and very small, sub-micron diameter, multiple quantum well microdisk lasers can also be realized. These remarkable microphotonic components achieve their high-Q due to total internal reflection of whispering gallery photon resonances at the curved air-dielectric interface of the structure. The confinement of photon field to a region near the dielectric interface and the long photon lifetime of the resonance enhances nonlinear interaction with the material. By careful electromagnetic design it is possible to optimize the overlap between the RF-field and the nonlinear optical response of the resonator, thereby ensuring power-efficient RF-to-optical conversion in a small volume.\r\n\r\nIn a mobile wireless application, a microsphere or microdisk is optically pumped using a laser diode. Direct RF-to-optical conversion is via the nonlinear optoelectronic response of the material. Two approaches will be explored. In the first the microresonator will be fabricated from lithium niobate and the electro-optic modulation response of the device investigated. The second approach will use the incident RF field to induce stimulated atomic transitions in optically pumped ruby. In addition to component-level research, the program will also study system design issues and develop models capable of predicting the impact of these technologies for mobile wireless applications.\r\n***\r\n",
