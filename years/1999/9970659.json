 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polynomials are present in nearly every area of mathematics. They have\r\nalways been and are likely to remain one of the central topics in Analysis,\r\nin particular. The major goal of this proposal is to study several vital\r\npolynomial problems in Classical Analysis and Analytic Number Theory, by\r\nusing the methods of Complex Function Theory, Potential Theory and\r\nApproximation Theory as a unifying approach. We have recently made a number\r\nof significant advances in the areas spanning from sharp inequalities for\r\nproducts and factors of polynomials, and Markov, Bernstein, Nikolskii type\r\ninequalities, to orthogonal polynomials, Faber polynomials, Bieberbach\r\npolynomials and Bergman kernel methods in approximation of conformal\r\nmappings. The considered problems represent a nice blend of a few subjects,\r\nwith applications in numerical approximation and symbolic computation. We\r\nhave also introduced new methods, related to potential theory with external\r\nfields, in a long-standing problem on integer Chebyshev constant (integer\r\ntransfinite diameter) and integer Chebyshev polynomials.\r\n\r\nThe methods and results of the proposed research help to solve very basic\r\nand important problems, such as factoring polynomials in the most efficient\r\nway, approximating functions by polynomials and studying the properties of\r\ncertain special polynomial families. Approximation problems considered here\r\nprovide tools for numerical ways of finding conformal mappings, which in\r\nturn have a number of interesting applications in engineering, physics and\r\nother sciences. Many special types of polynomials, such as orthogonal\r\npolynomials, are extensively used in various branches of natural sciences\r\nand in computations. This wide range of applications furnishes a strong\r\nmotivation for numerous deep and comprehensive studies of polynomials, and\r\nfor our project, in particular.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
