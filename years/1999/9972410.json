 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will bring together a committee of experts from industry and academia to examine basic research and technological innovations, with the dual goals of: (1) Determining the financial impact of technological innovations in communications and information theory, and (2) Ascertaining the research model that was used in developing these innovations.  The committee will be convened for a one-day meeting on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX, to develop the findings.  A draft report will then be prepared and submitted to the committee for comments.  A final report will then be submitted to NSF, posted on the SMU web site, and distributed via hardcopy upon request.  The report will contain a succinct summary of what are considered the most significant technological advances in communications, their estimated financial impact, and the basic research environment that lead to these advances.  The report will also include recommendations for future research planning, with the goal of increasing or sustaining the influence of basic research in communications and information theory on technological innovations.",
