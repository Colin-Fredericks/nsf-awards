 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nBarnum \r\n9973340\r\n\r\nCyanobacteria are a diverse group of oxygen-producing, photosynthetic bacteria that inhabit virtually every major aquatic and terrestrial biome - desert, freshwater and marine, including hot springs and sub-Arctic and Antarctic regions. Cyanobacteria are particularly important in poor soils and nutrient-depleted regions and are the major suppliers of fixed nitrogen through the process of nitrogen fixation. Some species form symbiotic relationships with various plant species and directly provide nitrogen for uptake by plants.  Cyanobacteria have an ancient history dating back almost 3.5 billion years.  They diversified extensively to become some of the most successful and ecologically significant organisms on Earth, with respect to longevity of the lineage and impact on the Earth's early environment.  It is widely believed that cyanobacteria were responsible for the conversion of the Earth's anaerobic atmosphere to an aerobic one via oxygenic photosynthesis - a pivotal event that led to the evolution of diverse life on Earth.  While carbon dioxide fixation, through photosynthesis, arose early in the evolution of organisms, it is not known when nitrogen fixation first occurred. Since nitrogen fixation enzymes are irreversibly inactivated by oxygen, it has been proposed that nitrogen fixation is an ancient process that existed before the Earth's atmosphere became aerobic.  However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with the random pattern of occurrence of nitrogen fixation among various lineages of living bacteria (including the cyanobacteria), rather than a pattern of universal occurrence that is expected on the basis of an ancient origin.  Within the Cyanobacteria, there are approximately nine evolutionary lineages.  One of these, the heterocystous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria possesses heterocyst cells - a unique adaptation for spatially excluding oxygen. The heterocystous lineage of cyanobacteria is well suited for a pilot study on the evolution of nitrogen fixation (nif) genes. Ribosomal DNA sequences (23S ribosomal RNA genes) will be used to determine the evolutionary history of the heterocystous lineage, as an independent framework to evaluate the DNA sequence evolution of one of the three nitrogen fixation genes, nifD. Ultimately, additional nitrogen fixation genes and other cyanobacterial lineages will be examined.\r\n",
