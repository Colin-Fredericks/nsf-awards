 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a new outreach initiative using tiered role models, aimed to increase the involvement of persons with disabilities in higher engineering, science, mathematics, and technology (SMET) education and careers.  The goal is being achieved through an innovative outreach program which focuses on the critical need for and impact of role models in encouraging peers with disabilities to pursue SMET areas.  This innovative program will develop a tiered structure of role models of progressive age groups from K-12 and into the undergraduate and graduate and professional levels, linking each younger group with slightly older groups of students.  Therefore, it will provide both age appropriate research exposure and vital links with role model students in SMET areas for interaction and encouragement.  It will specially target the deaf and hearing impaired, drawing on our extensive and successful history working with this population of disabled students.  At the undergraduate level, it will provide individualized research experiences, communications training and supportive follow-up.  At the high school and upper middle school level, it will provide a science and engineering summer experience on the Duke campus for these students, interacting with the undergraduate students with disabilities.  At the middle school and below level, it will provide these young students an introduction  to SMET emphasizing older students with disabilities as role models of what can be achieved.  At each level, students are being exposed to students of older age groups with whom to identify, and will also be exposed to successful role models of professionals pursuing their careers.  Identified individuals to serve as role models of deaf and hearing impaired professions include former students in the outreach Program of the National Science Foundation/Engineering Research Center for Emerging Cardiovascular Technologies (NSF/ERC), who are in SMET Ph.D. programs, and professional who are teaching in SMET areas and working in SMET-related industries.  These postgraduate alumni role models will come to campus to give presentations in their areas of SMET specialty, as well as lead open discussions on career and advanced studies issues, and on being a deaf professional.  The goal of this stepwise approach is to provide a realistic model for the student's next level of development, which will make the achievements of successful professionals seem more obtainable and through the power of role models, motivate more deaf and hearing impaired students to participate in SMET education and careers.\r\n\tThe project has the full cooperation of the faculty and administration of the NSF/ERC and the School of Engineering.  Some presentations and outreach efforts for recruitment and follow-up will take place in the students' home institutions, the public schools of Durham County, the home county of Duke University.  Public school students from the K-12 level from the Durham County School System will be involved, as will deaf and hearing impaired students from Gallaudet University and other universities.\r\n",
