Currently used parameters such as contractility, stiffness, elastance, and other relationships are dependent on these material properties. However, these properties are very difficult to determine and they may vary from region to region. The application of a novel technique, known as the \"computer aided speckle interferometry\" (CASI), provides a major advance in defining the deformation of the myocardium in response to intracavitary pressure. This technique allows the determination of full field deformation over a large area of myocardium with extreme spatial resolution. It is the objective of this proposal to fully develop this technique as applied to measuring myocardial deformation. Subsequently, this technique will be used to determine the response of the myocardium due to ischemia. And the correlation between the changes of the material properties and permanent tissue damage (infarction) will be studied.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the objectives of this proposal are:\r\nTo develop the \"CASI technique\" to measure regional deformation in the heart;\r\nTo correlate epicardial regional area strain with intracavitary pressure, hence to develop a pressure-strain relationship for different regions of the heart;\r\nTo measure epicardial regional area deformation simultaneously in three distinct regions; namely ischemic, non-ischemic, and border regions;\r\nTo develop a method, based on measured epicardial regional area deformation, of predicting the extent of perfusion (i.e., ischemic, non-ischemic, border region).\r\n\r\nThe CASI technique employs a random dot pattern, called speckles, created on the surface of a specimen. Upon deformation the speckles move accordingly. Instead of tracking the movement of individual particles, a speckle correlation calculation is used to monitor the displacement of a cluster of speckles. The speckle pattern before and after deformation is captured and digitized using a CCD (charge coupled device) camera. The image is sub-divided into subimages. Each subimage represents a \"point\" whose displacement is calculated using the CASI software. To demonstrate its applicability to measuring strain in the heart, a pilot study using three rabbit hearts was performed. Silicon carbide particles were dispersed onto the myocardium in regions ranging from 5 x 5 mm to 10 x 10 mm. Two ultrasonic transducers were implanted just outside the region of interest and strains obtained by sonomicrometry were compared to that calculated by CASI.  The techniques produced essentially the same results (r2= 0.997).  However, CASI has many advantages.  First, it gives a whole field strain distribution that covers a large area of the heart.  Second, the resolution is at least two orders of magnitude better than techniques currently used as evident by pilot studies that have shown a spatial resolution of 0.1 x 0.1 mm.  And with a new CCD camera, a further increase in resolution can be achieved.  Third, the speckle technique does not damage the heart tissue, as the implanting of sono-transducers will do, for example. \r\n\r\nIn another set of pilot studies, CASI was used to determine deformation in perfused, non-beating hearts. Significant differences in the same heart were found between the perfused and non-perfused states in response to passive loading. In another heart, a portion of the heart was made ischemic. Deformation in the heart showed significant changes between the ischemic and perfused regions. The final pilot study involved mapping the deformation in a beating heart. Changes in myocardial deformation could be seen corresponding to the contraction and relaxation stages of the heartbeat.\r\n\r\nThese pilot studies have shown that CASI is a useful technique to measure function in the myocardium in various regions of the heart.  This has importance clinically, as the heterogeneous consequences of coronary artery disease on myocardium performance render precise assessment of regional function imperative. This proposal will refine the CASI technique and apply it to useful clinical scenarios.  The accuracy of the technique will be improved by optimizing the creation and processing of the speckle pattern, which is a function of speckle size, speckle contrast, and CCD camera resolution, among other factors. The effects of regional ischemic on the beating heart, which has important clinical implications, will also be investigated.  In summary, this proposal will developed a technique to accurately measure regional functional changes simultaneously over many small regions of the heart.\r\n",
