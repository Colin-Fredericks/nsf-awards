 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyzer has allowed us to continue to build on our inquiry-based foundation adapted from the coursework and research of Baldwin 1970,1972; Manley and Manley 1997; and Coish, 1998.  The instrument was adapted based on its accuracy compared to other methods of particle size analysis (e.g. pipette and hydrometer methods), and also its ability to rapidly analyze numerous samples over a wide range of particle size.   As a result we have improved:  1) our curriculum in the environmental geochemistry, geomorphology, marine geology, environmental geology and hydrology courses,  2)  the laboratory component of the introductory environmental science course, 3) opportunities for undergraduate research, and 4) research opportunities for students and faculty from nearby colleges and universities.  \r\nWe have combined laser particle size analysis with existing instrumental resources (e.g., XRD, ICP, SEM-EDS) and field-based resources to create an interdisciplinary approach to surficial and environmental geology.  Students using hands-on now have the opportunity to practice critical thinking, investigate their own hypotheses, and experience where they can apply and hone important analytical skills. \r\nWe are offering a short course for faculty from regional colleges interested in applying laser particle size analysis to student and faculty research.  This short course emphasizes applications of particle size analysis to geology, soil science and environmental science allowing for faculty enhancement and access by students from regional colleges for use in their research projects.\r\n.",
