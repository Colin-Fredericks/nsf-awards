The proposed project encompasses the following topics: statistical approach to ill-posed problems for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), analysis of optimal input signals for parameter estimation, and averaging and singularly perturbed systems with transient and null-recurrent diffusions.  To treat the ill-posed problems, the techniques will be based on statistical approaches. Assuming that the observation is the solution of an ODE or a PDE plus a white Gaussian noise with small intensity, the attention will be devoted to the estimation of the unknown source of nonlinear PDEs and certain coefficients appearing in linear differential equations.  The nonparametric estimation approach to reconstruction of initial/boundary conditions for PDE with partial observations in white noise will be studied. Focusing on analysis of optimal signals for parameter estimation, the main effort is to find asymptotically efficient adaptive estimation procedures. Asymptotically stable, neutral, and unstable systems will be examined.  A two-step estimation procedure will be adopted.  The first step builds a preliminary estimator based on input signals, and the second step fine tunes the estimate using a Newton-Raphson type correction.  Analyzing asymptotic properties of diffusion processes where the fast changing process does not possess a finite invariant measure, both null-recurrent cases and transient processes will be treated.  In addition to obtaining certain results on limit distribution of integral functionals of null-recurrent diffusions, the asymptotic properties of the singularly perturbed systems will be examined in detail.  The proposed topics are motivated by various applications in control, optimization, image processing and other related fields. The expected results will have a wide range of applications.\r\n\r\n\tThe fast-paced progress in technology and the complexity of modern systems necessitates communication, exchange of ideas and cooperative research at the international level.  The proposed project presents an effort of cooperative research between researchers from Wayne State University and outstanding scientists from Russia.  By combining force and expertise, asymptotic analysis for singularly perturbed stochastic systems will be examined and statistical estimation problems will be studied.  The results of the research will be useful for many applications in manufacturing systems, data analysis, image processing, control and optimization of stochastic systems.  The continued and increased collaborations will bring both short and long term fruitful returns.  The proposed project will be successful and effective in accelerating progress in these fields.  The cooperative research project will also foster the establishment of long term significant collaborations among the researchers in the U.S. and Russia, which will also be beneficial to the international scientific community.\r\n",
