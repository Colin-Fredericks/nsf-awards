 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research for the development of computational methods for the solution of a number of engineering optimization applications, including facilities layout problems, facilities location problems, and a new model arising in jet-engine design.  The goal of this research is to develop implementable new methods\r\nfor finding approximate global solutions to these and related problems by utilizing specific problem properties.  This effort will include the development of new theory and methodology that exploits problem structures such as eigenstructure, monotonicity, quadratic forms with structured matrices, and difference of convex functions, and that deals with computational difficulties caused by problem symmetry.\r\n     Facilities layout problems arise in manufacturing, production, warehousing, and logistic systems.  This grant will develop computational tools for finding global solutions for instances of these problems that have 20 or more facilities, thus doubling the size of problems solvable today.  Models for continuous facilities\r\nlocation problems are similar to models for locating components on integrated circuits and to models for the protein folding problem in computational biology.  The goal of this research is to develop methods to solve problems with 10 facilities or more, which amounts to doubling the size of problems solvable today.  Turbomachines contain bladed-disks whose performance is susceptible to blade-to-blade imperfections.  This \"mistuning\" limits the achievable tradeoff between manufacturing tolerances (cost), damping performance), and blade vibration amplitudes (engine life and safety).  Unavoidable random mistuning due to manufacturing uncertainties limits engine manufacturers' ability to decrease cost AND increase performance and safety.  Intentional (optimal) mistuning mitigates this tradeoff by introducing damping (a safety margin) in a robust manner.  This means that there is more room to decrease cost, increase safety, and improve performance.  Currently, problems are being solved with up to 30 blades.  This research will develop solution techniques for handling up to 100 blades.\r\n",
