DeCoursey\r\n\r\nBehavioral and Neurophysiological Effects of Circadian Pacemaker (SCN) Deletion in a Wild Population of Rodents.\r\n\r\nThe research will examine the importance of the neural pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which regulates circadian (daily) behavioral and physiological functions in all mammals. The study will follow survival and behavior of a population of free-living ground squirrels at a remote Cascade mountain site over a 3-year period. Part of the population will be left neurologically intact as control animals, and the remainder of the population modified by surgical deletion of the circadian timing system. Mortality, reproductive success, hibernation performance, and neuroendocrine patterns will be monitored. A uniquely coded radio collar will be attached to each study animal to facilitate radio tracking and wintertime radio data-logging.\r\nCircadian pacemakers have been shown to play a vital role in many important daily rhythms of animals including humans, such as sleep/wake cycles, efficiency cycles, timing of reproduction, temperature regulation, levels of hormones in the body, or response to medications. In spite of the great significance of circadian pacemakers in mammals, prior studies\thave used chiefly domesticated small nocturnal rodents such as mice, rats, and hamsters. Research projects have beencarried out almost exclusively in the laboratory under completely sheltered, stress-free, often sterile conditions. As a result, very little evidence is available for wild species living under truly natural conditions in normal ecological niches. The new \"ecological brain research\" information accrued should aid in problem solving for a range of questions from optimizing survival of threatened/endangered wild species to improving health and welfare of humans.\r\n\r\n",
