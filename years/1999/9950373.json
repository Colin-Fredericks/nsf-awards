 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a Biology laboratory for non-majors to include scientific inquiry and critical thinking skills especially needed by the elementary education majors. The planned laboratory course, adapted from a NSF funded investigative non-major Biology laboratory at Clemson University, includes inquiry in a computer networked facility. The student will experience 6 inquiry based investigations. The course is organized into three phases.\r\n\r\nIntroduction: Working in cooperative teams, students will carry out 4 inquiry-based activities demonstrating process skills of the science discipline. Practice: Teams will select an organism to investigate through a guided inquiry. Investigations will focus on aspects of growth and development. Application: Teams will then design and execute an original inquiry on their organism. Team members will be required to develop background information from electronic resources. Teams will \"record\" all experimental data, internet information, and pertinent course material in their \"computer\" notebook. Presentations to the class will be via a computer projection system.\r\n\r\nFor this course new laboratory exercises will be developed by the PI's. Basic lab skills will be taught via CD-ROMs, web sites, lab manuals and instructor demonstrations. Collaborative efforts with faculty from the education department will allow for the evaluation of education majors over a four year period. This effort will examine the impact of this new course on future teachers from Xavier. The new facilities will be used to introduce inquiry life science teaching to classroom teachers during summer workshops.\r\n",
