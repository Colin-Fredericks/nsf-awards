 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the determination and control of GaN film polarity. Due to the lack of native substrates, nitrides are typically grown on foreign substrates such as sapphire. This substrate limitation coupled with the polar nature of nitride growth leads to two possible surface terminations, Ga or N. A mixture of these two terminations leads to the presence of inversion domains, which cause polarization effects. These effects arise from two sources: spontaneous polarization at heterointerfaces due to the ionic nitride bonds, and strain-induced piezoelectric polarization caused by lattice misfit or thermal strain. Inversion domains can adversely affect transport properties, band alignments, and carrier concentrations in heterojunction devices. In this research, fundamental materials science phenomena associated with domain structure and film polarization will be investigated for greater understanding and control. The approach is to study the influence of substrate surface and growth initiation on film polarity, the role of spontaneous polarization and layer ordering on band discontinuities, and the effect of piezoelectric polarization on electrical and optical properties. The goal is to achieve fundamental understanding and thereby be able to produce single-domain films, and to grow heterostructures, e.g., quantum wells whose properties depend on the relative magnitudes of spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization effects. Growth techniques including Molecular Beam Epitaxy with in-situ monitoring and Organometallic Vapor Phase Epitaxy will be used. Analysis techniques such as in-situ reflection high energy electron diffraction, ex-situ atomic force microscopy/scanning tunneling microscopy, high-resolution x-ray diffraction, photoemission, and CW/time-resolved luminescence will be employed to investigate film morphology, strain, band discontinuities, and emission energies.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance. Once a fundamental understanding of the polarization fields in heterostructure devices is obtained, it will be possible to design structures that more completely realize the potential of GaN-based electronic/photonic devices and circuits. An important feature of this collaborative, interdisciplinary program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.  \r\n***\r\n",
