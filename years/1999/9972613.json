The classification of the finite\r\ndimensional simple representations of L is one of the fundamental results in\r\nrepresentation theory.  Herzog's project is to extend the classification to\r\nthe simple pseudo-finite dimensional representations of L -- a representation\r\nis called pseudo-finite dimensional if in the language of L-modules it\r\nsatisfies the axioms for a finite dimensional representation.  The project\r\ninvolves describing the topology induced by the Ziegler spectrum on the space\r\nof simple pseudo-finite dimensional representations of L.  For the Lie\r\nalgebra of two-by-two matrices of trace zero, it is a compact Hausdorf space\r\nthe cardinality of the continuum, of which the finite dimensional simple\r\nrepresentations form an open, dense and discrete subspace.\r\n     A group is the mathematical concept used to study the structure of\r\nsymmetries of an object that may occur in physics or the other natural\r\nsciences.  In the mathematical theory of representations, the goal is to\r\nstudy a group G by classifying all the objects -- the representations of G\r\n--- of which G is a symmetry group.  For many groups, this program has met\r\nwith stunning success by associating to G a Lie algebra L whose\r\nrepresentations mirror those of G, and then classifying the representations.\r\nThe objective of L. Herzog's project is to study the finite dimensional\r\nrepresentations of certain Lie algebras L, using the methods of mathematical\r\nlogic.  The project focuses on the infinite dimensional representations X of\r\nL that are called pseudo-finite dimensional.  These representations are\r\nvirtually finite dimensional, in the sense that the limited power of\r\nexpression of the language being used cannot distinguish X from the finite\r\ndimensional representations.  In previous work, Herzog has applied the\r\nCompactness Theorem of Goedel to show that there exist uncountably many\r\n``simple'' pseudo-finite dimensional representations.  However, a single such\r\nrepresentation has yet to be discovered, and part of Herzog's project is to\r\nconstruct a concrete example.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
