This \r\nlast one is an area that he initiated about a decade ago starting from a \r\nconcrete problem in medical imaging. This field has made contact with \r\nseveral unrelated fields in mathematics, ranging from wave propagation, \r\ncommutative rings of differential operators, etc.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator's work continues to be centered at the \r\ncrossroads between \"inverse problems\" in areas of biomedical interest \r\nincluding X-ray, Magnetic Resonance and Optical tomography on the one \r\nhand and a number of mathematical developments in areas like \r\nmathematical physics and signal processing. The research program is a \r\ntwo-proned approach aimed at identifying  important areas in medical \r\nimaging that are ripe for improved mathematical treatment. In certain \r\ncases this has given rise to new mathematical developments that should \r\neventually find useful applications. This work has proved useful in other \r\ninverse problems arising for instance in radar detection, noninvasive \r\nevaluation, etc.\r\n",
