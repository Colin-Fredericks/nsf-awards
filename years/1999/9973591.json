The proposed research centers around the need to produce high quality ceramic powders for advanced electronic and structural applications.  Composite powders must be composed of uniform, high-density, submicron particles.  Aerosol flow reactors provide a promising technology for producing high-quality powders since these processes are both low-cost and environmentally friendly.  Novel methods will be investigated to re-direct thermophoresis away from the reactor wall during the combustion nitradation synthesis of aluminum nitride.  The overall goal of the proposed work is to develop a model that describes particle production and growth in aerosol flow reactors characterized by highly exothermic reactions.  In addition to thermophoresis, the model will incorporate the effects of coagulation and coalescence, and thus will be capable of predicting final particle size and morphology.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the focus of the proposed work is on the direct nitradation of aluminum in aerosol flow reactors, the fundamental understanding of thermophoresis and its incorporation in a particle dynamics model will provide the framework necessary to extend this work to the synthesis of various fine nitride (e.g., HfN, Mo2N, TaN, TiN, and ZrN), as well as other powders produced using similar exothermic processing.\r\n\r\nThis award is made in response to the POWRE solicitation.\r\n",
