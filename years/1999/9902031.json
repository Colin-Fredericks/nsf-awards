 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two kinds of calculi are prevalent in automated theorem proving: saturation calculi and tableau and connection calculi.  The latter support a goal-directed proof search, but the former are superior for logics with equality and similar domains.  The most spectacular success for theorem proving to date---the solution of the Robbins problem was obtained with a saturation method.\r\n\r\nIn saturation-based deduction, redundancy is a key concept.  Formulas or inferences are redundant if they either do not contribute to any derivation of a contradiction, or else contribute in ways that allow for alternative, but simpler derivations.  If all inferences from a set are redundant, the set is called saturated and is inconsistent only if there is an explicit contradiction.  Saturation thus provides a basis for checking for inconsistency.  An inference can always be rendered redundant by adding its conclusion to the current set of formulas, but techniques that avoid the generation of redundant formulas are indispensable for efficiency reasons.  The objectives of this project are to develop further insights into this process and to advance theorem proving technology by focusing on three key technique---saturation, extension, and combination.\r\n\r\nApproximation refers to techniques such as unification and constraints that connect inferences at different levels, for variable-free and general formulas, respectively.  The performance of saturation provers often depends on the subtle interaction between approximation and redundancy techniques. The extension of a formal language by new symbols has different uses in automated deduction, e.g., in congruence closure algorithms.  This research aims at developing a theory of congruence closure as saturation-based decision procedures, to include not only standard congruence closure, but also extensions to richer theories and elimination methods for translating back to the original language.\r\n\r\nSaturation techniques have been implicitly used in computer algebra methods such as Buchberger's algorithm or Wu's method for proving theorems in geometry.  The plan is to reformulate these methods in logical terms so as to integrate them in general-purpose provers and apply theorem proving techniques to obtain optimized or extended decision procedures.\r\n",
