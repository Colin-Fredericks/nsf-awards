 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rainey\r\nThis Microbial Observatory project involves a study of the patterns of prokaryotic diversity along land use gradients in the Central Arizona-Phoenix (CAP) Long-Term Ecological Research site. The research site comprises the city of Phoenix and surrounding areas, including suburbs, agricultural regions and undeveloped natural environments. The effect of urbanization on prokaryotic community composition and function will be investigated. The project addresses the following research objectives: (1) to discover representatives of new prokaryotic taxa, (2) to determine patterns of cultured, non-cultured and metabolic prokaryotic diversity and their relationship to land use, which exhibits both temporal and spatial variation in this urban environment, (3) to determine whether certain components of the prokaryotic community are ubiquitous irrespective of land usage and the taxonomic level of this ubiquity, (4) to add a prokaryotic component to an ongoing CAP LTER research project, to better understand the structure and function of urban ecosystems, and (5) to provide training and research experience for graduate and undergraduate students in the areas of prokaryotic diversity, ecology and taxonomy. The methods used in the project, encompassing culturing and non-culturing approaches, have been chosen to allow detection of as much as possible of the prokaryotic diversity present in a given sample. Sampling will be performed according to a design which will include both intensive investigation of a small number of sites, and a broader study of a large number of sites. The project will comprise the first investigation of prokaryotic community composition within a relatively small geographical space containing various land use types. It will add a prokaryotic component to the understanding of the biodiversity of urban ecosystems and complement the current investigations at the CAP-LTER site.",
