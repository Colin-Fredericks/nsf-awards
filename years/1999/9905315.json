 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this research is to understand the relationship between\r\nperception and action in the development of infant postural control.\r\nAlthough the development of posture and locomotion has been well\r\ndocumented, only recently has an understanding of the processes that\r\nunderlie these changes been sought.  This project examines\r\nperception-action coupling as one of the processes that may contribute to\r\nthe observed changes.  The research is designed to examine the relationship\r\nbetween perception and posture in three ways.  First, we propose to study\r\ninfants' postural development longitudinally from the onset of sitting to\r\nthree months after the onset of independent walking.  Second, we focus on\r\nthe role somatosensation plays in postural control.  And third, we measure\r\nthe coupling relationship between somatosensory input and the infant's\r\npostural responses.  Infants will be tested sitting and standing in one of\r\n3 conditions:  touching a fixed bar with the hand, no touch (hands free),\r\nor touching a gently moving bar.  Relationships between the excursions of\r\nthe head, center of mass, and center of pressure as well as forces applied\r\nat the hand will be analyzed.  Data are expected to provide critical\r\ninformation about the study of normal infant postural development as well\r\nas to lay a foundation for understanding those infants with abnormal or\r\ndelayed postural development.",
