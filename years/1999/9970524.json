One portion of the research will address one of the most difficult open problems in wavelet theory; namely, the development of a general framework for the construction of nonseparable orthogonal wavelets and multiwavelets in higher dimensions. The starting point is the recent time-domain characterization by the PI of the accuracy conditions for multidimensional multiscaling functions under an arbitrary dilation matrix. Combined with insights from self-similarity and iterated function systems, this suggests the possibility of weak substitutes for the factorizations that play the key role in one-dimensional constructions.  The second portion of the research concerns frames in Banach spaces, especially Gabor or windowed Fourier frames. Issues for Gabor systems arising from the interaction between algebra and analysis will be addressed, and Gabor frame decompositions will be applied to analyze pseudodifferential and other operators, utilizing the principle that Gabor frames provide unconditional decompositions for the class of function spaces known as the modulation spaces.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the mathematics underlying the processing and analysis of signals, such as images, music, and speech, but also more abstract types of signals. A signal can be processed by first breaking it down into simple, basic units and then manipulating those units in several different ways. This can be done in a nonredundant fashion, where each basic unit is independent of the others and contains one essential part of the total signal, or it can be done in a redundant way, where the information contained in different basic units overlaps. Nonredundant decompositions (\"bases\") may provide the most compact representation of a signal, whereas redundant decompositions (\"frames\") allow reconstruction of the signal even if some of the basic units are lost in transmission. The objective of this research is to construct and apply both types of decompositions in various settings. Wavelet bases in higher dimensions are especially suitable for the analysis of images. Gabor frames are related to decompositions that have been used throughout mathematics, quantum mechanics, and signal processing, and will be applied in this project to the analysis of operators, or transformations, of signals.\r\n",
