 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although intervention programs and new teaching methods have helped to close the gender gap in mathematics achievement and course taking, they have had much less effect on influencing girls' decisions about pursuing math-related college majors and careers (Campbell, 1995).  Moreover, there is substantial evidence that among girls, those from African-American, Latino, Native American or low-income backgrounds are in particular need of support and encouragement in this domain (College Board, 1997; see also Phillips, 1998).  U-M GIRL is an intervention program that addresses this problem by innovative, integrated math/social scientific research projects.  U-M GIRL builds in structure and support for the girls' gains in mathematics and technology by involving in the intervention program two of  their key teachers for the following year.  U-M GIRL is also a professional development program that aims to make the tools and strategies of the intervention program available to teachers to use in their home classrooms.  By including teachers in all aspects of the program, the impact of the intervention is multiplied to include the students in the teachers' classes in the following year -- and beyond!\r\n   The planning grant is based on findings of a pilot program, conducted in three middle schools in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The Institute of Research on Women and Gender at the University of Michigan will build a collaborative effort with additional school districts in Michigan, beginning with Ypsilanti and Detroit.\r\n",
