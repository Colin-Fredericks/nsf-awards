This work is centered around the NSL facilities, but also utilizes accelerators at other laboratories. The research program emphasizes extensive collaborations with experimental and theoretical physicists at other universities, often involving visits by these scientists and their students in order to use the NSL accelerator facilities.\r\nThe active areas of research at the NSL include reaction studies with short-lived radioactive nuclear beams, nuclear astrophysics, the study of weak interactions and related fundamental processes, and nuclear structure physics. These four topics span a large fraction of the frontiers of nuclear-physics research, and have a particularly large overlap with other areas of many-body physics. Yet, they are all closely related. For example, radioactive-beam physics is an important issue both for modern nuclear-astrophysics research and for the study of nuclear properties far from the valley of stability, while the properties of the nucleus as a quantal many-body system can and have been exploited to learn more about the laws of physics at the most fundamental level. The NSL is the site of pioneering work in the development of low-energy radioactive nuclear beams, and is an important center for research in nuclear astrophysics. In addition, local research groups in Atomic Physics and Radiation Chemistry carry out interdisciplinary programs using the NSL facilities.\r\nSpecific topics of current interest in nuclear astrophysics include the production of the elements in steady-state \"nuclear burning\" in main sequence stars, and in violent events such as nova and supernova explosions. The radioactive nuclear beam research is directed at achieving a better understanding of nuclear reaction processes relevant for solar neutrino physics, as well as the structure and reactions of weakly-bound \"halo\" nuclei which appear at the limits of nuclear stability and are believed to have very diffuse surfaces that are rich in either neutron or proton matter. The fundamental-interactions program emphasizes several issues relevant to the search for physics beyond the standard electroweak model of elementary particle physics, including the search for \"scalar currents\" in weak decays and the limits to time-reversal violation in the decay of the neutron. In addition, the weak decays of nuclei relevant for various aspects of solar neutrino physics are being explored. The nuclear structure program involves the study of static and dynamic nuclear phenomena, such as the harmonic and anharmonic vibrations of nuclei, the recently discovered \"magnetic\" and \"anti-magnetic\" rotation phenomena, and the attempt to obtain a more complete description of the structure of \"super-deformed\" nuclei.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
