This proposal\r\noutlines a number of projects that explore the interesting fine\r\nline between the rigidity and flexibility of the shapes of these\r\nspecial submanifolds.  Projects include studying the possible\r\nefficiency of symplectically packing subsets of euclidean space\r\nor cotangent bundles of tori and studying the possible evolution\r\nof symplectic balls or legendrian links and tangles under\r\nsymplectic or contact transformations.  Techniques include\r\ncombinatorics and homology theories defined via generating\r\nfunctions and pseudo-holomorphic curves.  In addition,\r\nconnections between symplectic geometry and biology are proposed\r\nbased on observed coincidental behaviors of legendrian curves and\r\nDNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymplectic and contact geometry have their origins in physics:\r\nthey are the setting for understanding spinning tops, mechanics\r\nof underwater vehicles, and planetary trajectories.  A basic\r\nproblem is to understand how a system can evolve under the\r\nnatural motions imposed by a contact or symplectic structure.\r\nOne approach to understanding the dynamics is to start with a\r\nstandard object such as a ball or a looped piece of string and to\r\nstudy the possible configurations that this basic shape can\r\nattain.  The results can be quite surprising.  For example,\r\nalthough many deformations of a ball are possible, a classical\r\nresult is that it can never be squeezed in particular directions.\r\nThis is a geometric version of the Uncertainty Principle from\r\nphysics.  This project aims is to give further insight into the\r\nflexibility and rigidity of these canonical transformations.\r\n",
