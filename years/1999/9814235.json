BASC's mission is to advance understanding of Earth's atmosphere and climate, to foster application of this knowledge to benefit the public, to advise the federal government on problems and research programs within the Board's area of expertise, and to assist agencies in their development and implementation of strong research programs that are responsive to scientific opportunities and national interests.   BASC's interests generally fall within 10 major areas: climate variability and change research, structuring and operations of climate observing systems, optimization of weather observation and forecasting systems, improvement of predictions of climate variability and change of relevance to societies, advancement of methodology for assessing the consequences of climate change, research on atmospheric composition and chemistry and its effect on radiation transfer, research on the chemistry and transport of air pollution, advancement of prediction capabilities for space weather as it impacts human-managed systems, research on atmospheric/land interactions and research on atmospheric/ocean interactions. The work is important because it coordinates and oversees atmospheric and climate sciences for the federal managers and also assists in the development of relevant programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
