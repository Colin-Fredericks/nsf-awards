The goal is to stimulate international and multidisciplinary research and educational activities that will address the many technical challenges facing development of future generations of wireless systems, and ultimately support the successful implementation of this technology in a wide variety of applications including education, medicine, transportation, and communications.\r\n\r\nThe international forum will be held in conjunction with the International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP 2000) in Japan. Attached is a copy of a draft of the conference announcement which will be modified to include a description of a special program for the \"Young Investigators' International Forum\". We propose that NSF provides travel expenses for up to 10 young investigators from the US to attend the ISAP conference, and it is expected that ISAP will waive the registration fee for the selected recipient of this NSF travel grants. \r\n***\r\n",
