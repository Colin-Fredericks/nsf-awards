The Conference will be held in at the Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, CO, January 3-9, 1999. Quantum mechanics, along with classical phenomenology, form the core of condensed matter physics. In recent years, if has become clear that large classes of materials exhibit critical behavior that are governed by a zero-temperature critical point at which a phase transition takes place between distinct quantum states of matter. The workshop will focus on this phenomena in 1, 2, and 3-dimensional systems, including areas such as the metal-insulator transition in 2-dimensions, quantum spin glasses, and phase transitions in dissipative systems. The NSF funds for the Conference will be used to defray the costs for Junior faculty and graduate student attendees.\r\n%%% \r\nThis award provides partial support for the 1999 Aspen Winter Conference entitled \"Quantum Criticality\". The Conference will be held in at the Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, CO, January 3-9, 1999.  The Conference will provide an assessment of an area of quantum mechanics of major importance in current research in Condensed Matter Physics.
