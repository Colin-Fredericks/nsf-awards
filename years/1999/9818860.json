 "awd_abstract_narration": "Close friendships among adolescents are known to contribute to cognitive and social development, psychological adjustment, and future socio-economic health. Adolescents who have difficulties finding or maintaining friendships are more likely as adults to be unemployed, be overly aggressive, or to experience serious mental health problems. Past research has uncovered many of the correlates, consequences, and quality of adolescent friendships. However, two constraints produce a limit on understanding of adolescent friendships. First, past research on friendships has focused primarily on white, middle class adolescents. Second, past research has not been conducted on the contextual factors that predict these formative relationships over time. The current program of research responds to these limitations by continuing a longitudinal, quantitative and qualitative study of friendships among urban African-American, Latino, and Asian American adolescents from low-income families. Two waves of data were collected in the fall of 1997 and the fall of 1998 when the adolescents were in the ninth and tenth grade, respectively. The follow-up study seeks to collect two more waves of data during the fall of 1999 and the spring of 2001 when the adolescents are seniors in high school and one-year out of high school, respectively. Drawing from ecological theories of development, the study addresses three sets of research questions: 1) How do contextual variables (family relationships, parental attitudes and rules, school climate, and neighborhood climate) influence the quality and characteristics of adolescent friendships? 2) What are the consequences of the quality and characteristics of friendships on psychological and behavioral adjustment over time? 3) How do adolescents experience their friendships? What are the gender and ethnic differences and age-related changes in their experiences of friendships? Why do such differences and changes occur? Understanding the mechanisms and factors that enhance or undermine friendships among urban, ethnic minority, low SES youth is critical to help such youth grow to be well-adjusted and healthy adults.\r\n",
