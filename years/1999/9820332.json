Students will receive financial awards plus a subsistence allowance.  The available research projects include (1) Environmental Sensors; (2) Intelligent Systems for Automation; (3) Communications Devices and Applications; (4) Motion Control; (5) Microprocessor/Instrumentation Applications; (6) Growth and Characterization of Thin Film Materials; and (7) Power Systems Applications.\r\n\r\nAt least five students will come from institutions where research opportunities are limited and at least four students will be women, minorities or students with disabilities.  Students chosen for the program will have displayed a high degree of initiative and independence of thought in both laboratories and course work.  Student research projects are chosen to match the student's interest and educational level.  In addition to extensive University facilities, students will also have access to facilities at various nearby industries such as Sensor Research and Development Corporation, BIODE Corporation, Bangor Hydro Electric and Central Maine Power Companies, James River, Champion, and Scott Paper Companies, Digital Equipment Corporation, Fairchild and National Semiconductor.  At the program culmination a written report and an oral seminar are required from the student.  Three academic credits are awarded to the student upon satisfactory completion of the program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
