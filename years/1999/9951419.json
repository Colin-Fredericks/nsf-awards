 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developments in technology have opened a tremendous realm of opportunities for the teaching and learning of mathematics.  One of the current imperatives within the movement to reform mathematics education is to appropriately utilize the power of computer technology to aid students with the synthesis of the symbolic, the numerical, and graphical meanings of mathematical concepts.  In the project, the mathematics faculty are adapting, implementing, and evaluating through class testing, materials developed through the NSF calculus projects including the New Mexico Research Projects in Mathematics and the Linear Algebra Modules Project (LAMP). They are integrating computer technology into the calculus program using Maple V. In addition, preservice teachers are using software such as Geometer's Sketchpad to test NSF funded elementary and middle school curricula. One of the central goals of this project is to further students' insight into the ideas of mathematics and then apply these ideas to problem solving.  Making multiple representations of mathematical concepts readily available to students through computer technology is providing a significant step in this direction. A Mathematical Teaching Laboratory (MTL) is providing the technological infrastructure within which the institution can implement fundamental changes in the way mathematics is taught.  Computer technology is being interwoven into, as opposed to simply added onto, the instruction of courses within the mathematics program. Students are being actively engaged in the learning process as they experience mathematical inquiry and discovery.  Individual and group projects are sharpening students' problem solving skills as well as their verbal and written communications skills.  Educational software geared towards elementary and secondary education such as Geometer's Sketchpad, Logo, and MathView are being utilized in the MTL not only to teach mathematical concepts to future elementary and secondary teachers, but also to guide them towards pedagogy appropriate for the technological teaching aids that will be available to them as they enter teaching.",
