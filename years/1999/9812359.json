 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project will underwrite improvements in the small boat and diving programs at Moss Landing Marine\r\nLaboratories (MLML).  A Maine-style lobster vessel will  be converted into a vessel used for teaching and\r\nresearch.  The conversion will include: installation of an \"A\" frame, winch and wire, and hydraulics for\r\nlaunching and recovering scientific sampling gear (e.g. trawls, benthic sleds,plankton nets, benthic grabs, corers, CTD's camera sleds,side scan sonar fishes, etc.) An observation deck will be installed above the wheel house, requiring moving and installing the radar and antennas onto a new higher mast.  A bulkhead would be constructed aft of the wheel house.  One small boat will be purchased and outfitted with outboards, steering linkage, and electronics.  SCUBA air compressor will be purchased to replace a 23 year old compressor.\r\n\r\nMoss Landing Marine Laboratories operates one of the most active educational and research facilities for\r\nmarine sciences in the U.S.  Of the approximately 100 graduates students in the marine science Master's \r\nprogram at any time, about 80 will use the small boats for class projects, class field trips, or research projects for their for their Master's degree.  Not only does the accessibility of small boats at MLML allow\r\nstudents a great deal of field experience, many become trained and experienced with handling small boats and related sampling equipment.  In 1993, a survey by the American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS)\r\nreported MLML had the third most active scientific dive program in the U.S.  The dive equipment at MLML is\r\nused for classes (Marine Science Diving and Subtidal Ecology)and for many of the Master's research projects.\r\n\r\nThe replacements and upgrades in the small boats and diving programs at MLML will greatly improve the \r\nfacilities and equipment for undergraduate and graduate education and research in marine science at MLML.\r\nSmall boats will be used for offshore and estuarine course activities, research by visiting faculty, and use \r\nby neighboring researchers.  Improvements in the diving program would benefit the courses and research\r\nresearch that require diving and visiting researchers that use the MLML facilities.",
