The upgrade of the microprobe facility will focus on acquiring a state-of-the-art, PC-based automation and imaging system, to replace the current system that is based on workstation technology from almost two decades ago. The new system will provide column automation and spectrometer and stage control in a flexible PC-based operating environment, that is also inexpensive to upgrade and repair. The new system will generate fast analytical data output in formats compatible with personal computers. Its image acquisition capabilities will make it possible to generate X-ray maps, low magnification electron images, and mosaics of large areas, that are necessary in order to study large geological samples.  The electron microprobe is a key component in several active research programs at UGA in experimental, igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary petrology (by A. E. Patino Douce, M. F. Roden, S. E. Swanson, J. A. Whitney and L. B. Railsback), clay mineralogy (by P. A. Schroeder), and archaeological geology (by. E. Garrison). In addition, the UGA microprobe is a regional facility, that supports work by researchers at Georgia State University, Clemson University (South Carolina), Auburn University (Alabama) and the Virginia Museum of Natural History.\r\n***\r\n",
