 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tDo variations in the shape and location of electoral districts affect citizen engagement in the political process?  Can districts be manipulated in ways that impact the political attitudes and behaviors of citizens?  Although these questions are central to current debates over congressional redistricting, there has been little systematic examination of the link between district characteristics and citizens.  This dissertation analyzes this linkage by (1) collecting data on electoral district characteristics and citizen attitudes and behavior in the 1980s and 1990s, and (2) using multi-level analytical techniques to investigate how the context created by various electoral districts impacts the political attitudes and behaviors of district residents.\r\n\tThe primary objective of this researc is to address a basic and important question:  How can electoral districts be structured geographically to encourage or discourage political engagement and participation on the part of citizens?  Specifically, it develops and tests a theory linking geographic characteristics of districts to citizen behavior via the effects that a district can have on the ease of information exchange in the environment.  By gathering data on district characteristics (such as compactness scores and the degree to which districts conform to county and city  boundaries) from the range of districts in place in the United States, and merging this information with citizen attitude and participation measures, this dissertation is able to determine how variation in citizen attitudes relates to district differences.  This provides much-needed information to the debate over the standards applied to the drawing of electoral districts.  More generally, it also provides insight into how contextual variables can contribute to an understanding of individual-level behavior. \r\n",
