 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861180\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore an application of complex chatter theory to operator control of high-speed machining processes.  The approach will be numerical control (NC) program verification software that alerts machinists to vibration problems that might occur using the speeds and feeds they have selected and to recommend alternate, optimized speeds.  Phase I will:  [1] Evaluate and bound the errors of existing chatter theory in the context of a \"tool tuning\" methodology for high-speed milling;  [2] Confirm theoretical results at a state-of-the-art high-speed milling facility by  measuring and characterizing vibrations accurately;  and [3] Consolidate these results within an NC program verification software package that provides (a) recommended optimal spindle speeds, based on the theoretical stability lobes predicted for an associated tool, (b) a simple means to convey to a machinist where on the part and in the part program serious chatter is likely to arise, and (c) a means for users to amend parameters based on experience .\r\n     High-speed mill operators are not likely realizing the full advantage of their mill performance capabilities, relying instead on  conservative shop practice, which is based on conventional mills and a chatter avoidance strategy.  This software is expected to guide shop floor personnel through an optimal chatter-free speed and feed selection process, and though based on complex theory, it will use terms familiar to them.",
