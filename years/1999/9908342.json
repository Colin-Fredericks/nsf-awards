 "awd_abstract_narration": "***\r\n9908342\r\nPierce\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a time domain reflectometry\r\n(TDR)-based method of detecting and measuring, in real-time, the development of\r\ninternal shear zones within centrifuge models of soil structures.  TDR is\r\nanalogous to radar in that voltage is pulsed along a coaxial cable to detect\r\nelectromagnetic faults.  When a cable is embedded in a deforming geologic\r\nmaterial, the cable shears and reflects a small percentage of voltage.  The\r\nability to measure internal shear zone development during testing will provide\r\na powerful tool to investigate the behavior of soil subjected to a wide variety\r\nof loading conditions.  It will also allow more comprehensive comparisons of\r\nphysical model behavior to numerical predictions than currently possible.  The\r\nadvantages of real-time measurement of internal shear zone development will be\r\ndemonstrated through the modeling of overconsolidated clay slopes.  Prior\r\ncentrifuge studies of overconsolidated clay slopes have shown that sudden\r\nfailures involve block-type motion along a distinct failure surface.  In\r\naddition to the benefits provided by the instrumentation aspects of this\r\nproject, the investigators will evaluate the effects of grain size, soil shear\r\nstrength and stiffness, and the use of grout on TDR measurements in soil. \r\nFinally, the results of this work will aid in the development of field use of\r\nTDR in soils.\r\n\r\nThe project is divided into four main tasks: 1) TDR instrumentation\r\ndevelopment; 2) laboratory feasibility testing; 3) centrifuge development\r\ntesting; and 4) centrifuge modeling of overconsolidated clay slopes.  In the\r\nfirst task, the investigators will use a modified direct shear device to\r\ndetermine the effects of soil grain size, soil strength and grout encapsulation\r\non shear displacement measurements using different TDR cables.  In the second\r\ntask, the investigators will conduct small- and large-scale bearing capacity\r\nmodel tests to evaluate the ability of TDR to detect multiple shear zones, the\r\nquality and reproducibility of the data, and the robustness of selected cables\r\nunder these conditions.  In the third task, bearing capacity tests will be\r\nconducted at the University of Florida using a geotechnical centrifuge with a\r\nradius of 1.85m, a maximum acceleration of 100g and a maximum payload of\r\napproximately 70kg to demonstrate the ability of the TDR system to work in a\r\ncentrifuge environment.  The accuracy and reliability of TDR measurements will\r\nbe evaluated and centrifuge results will be compared to the large-scale\r\nlaboratory tests.  The final task utilizes the new instrumentation to evaluate\r\ninternal shear development in overconsolidated slopes.  Long-term and\r\nshort-term tests on overconsolidated clay slopes instrumented with TDR cables\r\nand LVDTs will be conducted.  The objectives are to determine if internal shear\r\ndisplacements occur prior to failure; if shear displacements can be detected\r\nprior to surface movement; and how the location of these displacements relates\r\nto the internal stress-state of the slopes.\r\n***\r\n",
