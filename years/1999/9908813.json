The objectives of the workshop are to facilitate communication among researchers and managers from the United States and Latin America; to consolidate existing information about ducks, geese, and swans in the neotropics; and to stimulate conservation and further research of this little-studied group of birds. Because neotropical waterfowl have evolved in a different ecological context than their temperate counterparts, different social systems and breeding strategies have arisen.  Study of these differences can contribute to the field of behavioral ecology and evolution.\r\n\r\nThe workshop, organized in response to the lack of a comprehensive source of current information on neotropical migrants and residents of the family Anatidae and from a desire to develop an improved communication network of local and foreign scientists working with neotropical waterfowl in Latin America, will be divided into two sessions dealing with ecology, behavior, evolution, and natural history and two other sessions dealing with conservation and management.  A combination of small and large group discussions will produce a draft of suggested research and conservation actions that will be included in the workshop proceedings in order to provide guidelines for future work.\r\n***\r\n",
