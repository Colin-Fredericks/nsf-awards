 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875206\r\nKornegay\r\nAerospace and defense system applications, both in the military and civilian arenas, place heavy demands on the development of sensor technology for electronic systems that can survive in harsh environments. These demands will be met by wide bandgap materials, but more importantly, how the benefits of using these materials can be exploited. This proposal covers an effort to develop wireless microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology for harsh environment applications (e.g., high temperature, corrosive, erosive, etc.). The research plan offers a direct path to the realization of a wireless sensor instrumentation system through innovative research in silicon carbide (SiC) fabrication, circuit integration, and electronic packaging. The support electronics for the wireless sensor will provide signal conversion, communication, and self-calibration functions. All fabrication will be done in the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility (CNF) and all packaging work, including development of high temperature die attach materials, wires and wire bonds, will be done in the Cornell Advanced Electronic Packaging Facility.\r\nThe research plan will be augmented with innovative educational activities that integrate research and teaching with practical hands-on experiences. A multidisciplinary course titled \"Integrated Electronics for Harsh Environments,\" will he developed. The course will teach microelectronic integration principles, and apply them to the design and analysis of MEMS for harsh environments. It will cover topics in wide bandgap materials, fabrication technology, devices, circuits, packaging, system integration, working in teams, and the effective use of computational prototyping CAD tools facilitated by the World Wide Web. Graduate student advisees will also be introduced to problems at government and industrial laboratories that will help them acquire valuable hands-on experience as welt as learn about research that is relevant to the needs of government and industry.\r\n***\r\n",
