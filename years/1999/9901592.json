Group communication technology is becoming commonly exploited in academia and industry, and the significance of the group communication paradigm is becoming widely acknowledged.  The goals of the work are to 1) construct a comprehensive framework for the construction of groupware and computer supported cooperative work applications, based on the group communication paradigm, 2) model complex distributed systems formally, focusing on group communication systems, and implement algorithms and communication protocols in a way that would allow verification of the actual implementation, and 3) understand more of the inherent limitations of fault tolerant distributed systems and the tradeoffs involved in building such systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
