 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860591g\r\n     Seeking to create expertise to exploit the potential of economies in online computer role-playing games, this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Cybernomics, Inc. will explore the options of designing a software Economy Engine for online games, which can be licensed to game developers.  In addition, the project will determine whether existing commercial games can be exploited for economic research or whether a new game should be developed solely for research purposes.  The new genre of computer games that has emerged, Massively Multi-Player, Persistent World Online Role-Playing Games, is unique in that these games create small, self-contained economies, not economic simulations.  These economies consist of actual people exchanging commodities and currency of actual value in the game world.  The market for these games is strong and growing, with major computer game developers working on similar projects.  Through its experience in networked games for economic research, Cybernomics is in position to assist both game developers with design and business consultants, marketers and economic researchers with a new arena in which to conduct experiments.  Cybernomics will bring its experience in the theory and practice of market design to bear on the understanding and creation of market institutions for online games.  In addition, the firm will develop techniques to conduct low cost experiments in and extract data from these large-scale games salient to real-world markets.\r\n     The project targets two markets:  computer game developers and economic designers.  It presents an opportunity to contribute create better games as well as useful research tools.  It has the potential to revolutionize the way in which experimental research in economics is conducted and at the same time serve game developers and game players.\r\n\r\n",
