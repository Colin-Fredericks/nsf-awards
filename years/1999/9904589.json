The 5' end leaders and 3' end trailers are endonucleolytically removed by RNase P and 3'-tRNase, respectively. The CCA at the 3' end of tRNAs, required for aminoacylation, is added post-transcriptionally by tRNA nucleotidyl transferase (tNtase) after cleavage by 3'-tRNase. Like RNase P, 3'-tRNase and tNtase are thus essential eukaryotic enzymes.\r\nDrosophila RNase P will be purified in order to characterize its RNA and protein composition. The same will be attempted for Drosophila 3'-tRNase, the protein enzyme which removes the 3' end of pre-tRNA.\r\n Enzyme-substrate interactions will be characterized by gel mobility  shifts and UV-photo-cross-linking. The purification of Drosophila tRNA end-processing endonucleases will  contribute substantially to scientific knowledge. Putative RNase P RNA  from any insects. 3'-tRNase has been much less extensively studied  than other tRNA end-processing enzymes, although the substrate  recognition elements and catalytic mechanism of 3'-tRNase are of great  scientific interest. Equally important, the project will provide valuable research training to undergraduates at York College which has a predominantly minority (51.9% Black, 13.9% Hispanic, 9.5 % Asian, 0.3% Native American, 5.8% white), female (68%) enrollment. The project will strengthen enzyme purification skills used for both research and teaching. Some of the \r\nstudents trained in this research project, in a new Biochemistry lab course, and in the Biology and new Biotechnology majors, will join the ranks of under-represented minorities and women entering PhD-level \r\nResearch careers in Molecular Biosciences.\r\n\r\n",
