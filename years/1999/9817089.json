 "awd_abstract_narration": "Localization of RNAs to specific subcellular compartments occurs in a wide range of cell types, in diverse species ranging from yeast to humans. Cells localize RNAs to achieve high local concentrations of their protein products.  RNA localization is required for morphogenesis of polarized cells, and cell fates.  Maternally contributed determinants are localized in both vertebrate and invertebrate embryos by prior localization of their mRNAs during oogenesis.  One example is the Drosophila bicoid (bcd) gene product.  Localization of bcd mRNA to the anterior pole of the developing oocyte produces an anterior concentration gradient of Bicoid protein, a transcription factor required for determining anterior cell fates in the embryo.  The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms responsible for localizing bicoid (bcd) mRNA.  These experiments will lead to a better understanding of how RNAs are localized to specific cellular compartments, and will also contribute to a more general understanding of RNA and protein transport in cells. \r\n\r\nAn essential gene for bcd mRNA localization, exuperantia (exu), encodes a protein that is localized to particles. The central working hypothesis of this research is that the Exu particles are RNP complexes that transport bcd mRNA to its anterior anchor in the oocyte.  Light and electron microscopy will be used to examine the nature of these particles.  A major aim of this work is to investigate not only the accumulation of bcd mRNA, but the dynamic events of bcd RNA transport.  This will be accomplished using a novel method in which the RNA is labeled with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).  The contributions of the cytoskeleton, other genes, and elements within the mRNA itself, will be determined.  A final goal of this work is to identify other essential components of the Exu particles, and determine their role in RNA localization.  One candidate RNA localization factor that will be studied is an RNA-binding protein, identified previously in this laboratory by its ability to interact with Exu protein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
