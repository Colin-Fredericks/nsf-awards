A principal goal is to exploit the tunability of alkali metal substrates to study the interaction of prewetting and superfluidity, and to study superfluid onset on substrates of controlled strength and randomness. In analogy to the metal-insulator transition, the project seeks to identify substrates which span the range from supporting a highly localized Bose glass to those which serve as extremely weak and uniform substrates with no localized atoms. The experiments employ measurement of adsorption isotherms using microbalances, with particular attention to development of longitudinal mode oscillators which are sensitive to both the super and normal fractions. The research provides exceptional opportunities for graduate students to investigate fundamental issues in quantum fluids, and to gain experience in the development of new instrumentation.\r\n%%%\r\nThis low temperature physics project investigates the unusual properties of quantum fluids, principally helium, but also hydrogen, that condense in monolayer films on various metal surfaces. The research involves experiments of superfluidity on unusual substrates with very weak interactions. This experimental system provides extremely clean tests of our understanding of fluids interacting with a wall. This is important for issues ranging from lubrication to crystal growth. We will also exploit the many analogies between superfluidity and superconductivity to gain insight into both types of behavior. Novel types of silicon micromachined oscillators will be developed which can detect single layers of adsorbed atoms. The research provides exceptional opportunities for graduate students to investigate fundamental issues in quantum fluids, and to gain experience in the development of new instrumentation.\r\n",
