 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tDoes economic interdependence based on international trade and finance have pacifying or exacerbating effects on states' conflict behavior - or no effects at all?  Recent research yields contradictory inferences; findings seem to depend on the countries and years studied, and the techniques of analysis used.  Increasingly, policy makers assert that economic interdependence promotes interstate peace and cooperation.  But rarely is a theoretical and empirical justification provided by either policy makers or scholars.\r\n\tThis dissertation research provides insight into the domestic and international conditions under which trade and finance affect conflict.  The primary mechanism to be studied is the linkage from the economic costs and benefits to particular groups in society to their foreign  policy preferences, and their ability to affect states' foreign policy choices.\r\n\tThis dissertation research will:  (1) provide a more complete conceptualization and operationalization of economic interdependence; (2) construct a theory connecting economic interdependence to interstate conflict (wars, militarized interstate disputes, lower-level forms of conflictual behavior) via a testable, causal process; (3) investigate the domestic economic and political conditions linking international trade and finance to interstate conflict; (4) collect and compile the data necessary to conduct cross-national and longitudinal tests of hypotheses derived from the theory; and (5) statistically analyze and substantively evaluate the performance of the theory while controlling for plausible alternative explanations.  \r\n",
