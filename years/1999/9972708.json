R-genes tend to be quite variable in natural plant populations, yet the forces maintaining this genetic variation are not well understood. One hypothesis is that susceptible plants produce more seed than resistant plants under certain environmental conditions. In this way, resistance is not always favored and both phenotypes are maintained. The experiments detailed in this research test the hypothesis that the energetic cost of having a resistance response to a pathogen is greater than the benefit the plant receives from stopping pathogen growth under some circumstances. If R-gene resistance responses are costly, then the level of resistance response may determine whether a resistance response has a net benefit or cost. \r\n\r\nIn addition, this project will investigate whether different levels of resistance response have different benefits and costs for the plants. Arabidopsis thaliana infected in the greenhouse with its natural pathogen, downy mildew, will be investigated.  Plants that differ by the presence/absence of an R-gene but are otherwise genetically identical will be compared. In combination with theoretical investigations, these experiments will explore whether the level of R-gene mediated resistance is an important factor in the coevolutionary interactions between A.thaliana and downy mildew.\r\n\r\nThese experiments will provide fundamental knowledge about plant-pathogen coevolutionary interactions.  Knowledge about these interactions in natural populations will improve the application of pathogen resistance in agricultural plant species.\r\n\r\n",
