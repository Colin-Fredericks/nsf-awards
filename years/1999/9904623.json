 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although neural circuits of fear that include the amygdala have been delineated in the last decade, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms within the amygdala that are important for fear.  The goal of this project is to investigate in rats whether a class of regulatory factors for DNA transcription (4 genes of the early-growth-response family) plays a role in learning and memory of fear within the amygdala.  Several molecular biology techniques will be used to determine if the expression of these factors is increased in the amygdala with fear conditioning, suggesting that they have a functional role in fear learning.  To determine the role these factors play, learning and memory of fear will be investigated in genetically altered mice that lack these factors.  In addition, fear conditioning in normal rats in which compounds that block the genetic translation of these factors are injected into the amygdala will be investigated.  Blockade of fear\r\nconditioning will indicate that these factors play critical regulatory roles in learning and memory of fear.\r\nThe results from this project will increase knowledge of molecular processes important for learning and memory of fear.   Because fear is a primary emotion that has profound positive and negative consequences for human behavior, the scientific investigation of the biological underpinnings of fear will have broad significance for understanding emotional behavior.\r\n \r\n",
