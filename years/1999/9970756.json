SCAI is a scanned probe method that permits minute amounts of electrical charge to be locally resolved in a cryogenic environment. Initial experiments have examined samples for which the bulk of the 2DES acted as an electrical conductor. In contrast, by applying SCAI to 2DESs in an insulating state with respect to bulk transport, fundamentally distinct physics may be explored. This would include 2DES in the disorder-dominated insulator, and pinned Wigner crystal regimes, in addition to the interior compressibility at the center of a quantum Hall plateau.  The focus of the current project is to develop such a capability. This will require more advanced sample geometries, which include a three-dimensional electrode separated from the 2DES by a tunneling barrier. The specific goal is to demonstrate the utility of the SCAI for these systems.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research applies new scanning probe microscopy techniques to probe the behavior of electrons confined to two dimensions in semiconductor systems.  The goal is to further develop the technique to allow us to map out the spatial patterns formed by the charge when the sample is in an insulating state.  This will permit us to investigate fundamental aspects of the electron interactions with each other and with the disorder of the semiconductor. The research provides a challenging training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral research associates in an emerging technology.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
