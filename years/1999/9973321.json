 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop algorithms for solving nonsmooth systems of\r\nequations, addressing areas where methods for nonsmooth equations lag\r\nbehind those for smooth equations.  The first of these areas involves\r\nsolving highly nonlinear problems where an associated merit function\r\nmay have local minima that are not solutions.  Such problems cause\r\ndifficulties for descent-based methods, which may converge only to a\r\nlocal minimum of this merit function.  The second area focuses on\r\nsolving ill-posed problems (that is, those with singular, or\r\nill-conditioned Jacobian matrices at a solution).  The third area\r\naddresses developing limited memory methods for solving very\r\nlarge-scale problems.  In the smooth domain, a number of tools are\r\navailable for solving such very large-scale problems.  These include\r\npreconditioned conjugate gradient methods, limited-memory quasi-Newton\r\nmethods, Chebyshev methods, and truncated Newton methods.  Possible\r\nextensions of these methods to solving nonsmooth systems of equations\r\nwill be explored.  In addition to the pursuit of these natural\r\nextensions of smooth methods to the nonsmooth problem domain,\r\npractical algorithms for solving generalized equations will be\r\ndeveloped.  The ultimate goal of these four research areas is the\r\ndevelopment of high quality computer software for solving nonsmooth\r\nequations, which will be made publicly available.\r\n\r\nIn less technical terms, this project is aimed at developing high\r\nquality computer software for solving certain types of nonsmooth\r\nequations for which current computational tools are inadequate.\r\nNonsmooth equations provide a unifying framework for many important\r\nmathematical problems and have applications in a wide variety of\r\nfields.  Some examples include international trade, development\r\nplanning, financial options pricing, robotics, contact mechanics,\r\ntraffic equilibria, and economic equilibria.  Because of this wide\r\narray of applications, the development of software that improves\r\nour ability to solve nonsmooth equations will provide a valuable \r\ntool for solving many problems of national interest.",
