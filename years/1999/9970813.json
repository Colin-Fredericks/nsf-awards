The conference will be held at Vanderbilt University in conjunction with the annual Shanks Lectures, which will be delivered in 1999 by Professor William Arveson of the University of California at Berkeley. There will be nine plenary speakers at the meeting, all of whom are well-known mathematicians in analysis. The conference will have special sessions in operator algebras, operator theory, and harmonic analysis. The scientific purpose of the conference is to stimulate research in modern analysis and classical analysis. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the conference is to bring together not only established and new researchers, but also advanced graduate students who have begun exploring the subject. A major aim of the conference is to involve young researchers and to help them establish their research goals and directions. The participation of recent Ph.D. recipients and graduate students is a substantial part of the conference program. The scientific and educational significance of the conference is evidenced by the wide range of research topics presented, the diverse participation of researchers from mathematics departments, and the active participation of graduate students.\r\n",
