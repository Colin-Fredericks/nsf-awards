The oral traditions preserved in the language also known as ``Ladino'' but called ``Judeo-Spanish'' in this grant proposal, were gathered by Professors Farmstead, Katz, and Silverman during the years 1957-1980 from\r\ninformants from Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Morocco, Israel, Spain, and the United States. This material is the largest collection of Judeo-Spanish oral literature in North America, and one of the three largest in the world.  The Judeo-Spanish oral tradition preserves a cultural legacy for the study of Sephardic Jewry as well as for\r\nresearchers in the history of pan-Hispanic and pan-European balladry. This oral tradition, with roots extending back into Middle Ages, provides a unique matrix within which Hispanic written literature was created.\r\n\r\nThe technical goals of the project are to continue conversion of this material to a multi-media digital corpus so that these materials can be made ,more widely available, with increased access analytic capabilities.  Textual transcriptions will be tagged using a number of markup methods, especially XML and a digital audio database will be created.  A variety of approaches will be tested to make the archive fully extensible.  The\r\nproject will build on earlier research products from other digital libraries projects,\r\nincluding the University California, Berkeley digital libraries group.\r\n",
