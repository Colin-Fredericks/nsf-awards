The work involves the construction, demonstration and analysis of a prototype smart antenna CDMA wireless basestation using this experimental system.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this research is the emulation of the RaPiD configurable architecture using the large Xilinx Virtex FPGAs that have recently become available.  This RaPiD Emulation System has the same functionality as a single-chip RaPiD system that is the eventual target of this architecture.  The goal is for the emulation to have sufficient performance running at a target speed of 50 MHz to demonstrate real-time applications such as the CDMA wireless basestation.  Each component of the RaPiD architecture is emulated using FPGAs, including the datapath, the datapath controller, the stream controllers and the memory controller.  This experimental system is being used to emulate the final RaPiD architecture.  That is, the FPGAs are operated in a way that is constrained by the RaPiD architecture in order to provide an accurate measure of the cost and performance of the RaPiD architecture.  This emulation system provides opportunities to explore many alternative architectural and system ideas related to RaPiD.  This exploration could lead to an efficient definition of the RaPiD architecture as a computational core in system-on-a-chip technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
