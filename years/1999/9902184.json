 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the mechanism of thermal reactions of relatively small hydrocarbon molecules in order to probe more deeply the characteristics of the chemical transformations which convert them into other structures.  Analogs of these small molecules will be labelled with stable isotopes, which will serve as markers in the reactants.  A more comprehensive view of the reactions themselves may be gained through determining the disposition of isotopic labels in the products formed.  Insights as to reaction mechanisms and a stimulus to theoretical, molecular quantum mechanics-based attempts to comprehend the reactions will result.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the research of Professor John E. Baldwin of Syracuse University.  Professor Baldwin selects examples of reactions of interest involving relatively small molecules.  These molecules are synthesized while incorporating a nonradioactive isotope of carbon and/or hydrogen at specific sites, and the reaction of interest is then carried out.  By tracking the fate of the isotope, information into the minute goings-on of the reaction can be gathered, building toward a fuller understanding of the fundamental nature of what scientists refer to as a \"chemical reaction.\"\r\n",
