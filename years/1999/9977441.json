(Principle Investigators: Tenore, Miller, Rowe, Paynter, Houde)\r\n\r\nOngoing research in fisheries, environmental chemistry, toxicology, and ecology in the environmental sciences at CBL span cellular through ecosystem levels of biological organization.  This transdisciplinary approach attracts visiting scientists to work with CBL faculty and insures graduate students in the education program a sound exposure to research across the broad spectrum of scientific questions and methodologies of environmental research. The acquisition of a whole organism micro-respirometry system that enables extremely accurate measurements of changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide of individual aquatic animals will strengthen research abilities in linking cellular to ecosystem biological processes to bioenergetic effects and provide graduate students access to training and availability for planning such research in planning their dissertation research project.\r\n\r\nOne frontier of environmental research is combining ecological and toxicological approaches in linking sub-lethal effects of stress to population effects that ultimately affect biotic community composition/survival and ecosystem production.  These sub-lethal effects can be caused by extremes in environmental factors such as water temperature or food quality/quantity or exposure to contaminants.  If the effects of such sub-lethal stress on population dynamics, survival, and production are to be predicted, it is necessary to understand, quantify, and predict the causal link between exposure to stress and organismal bioenergetics and resultant effects on population dynamics. Such studies can be used to examine energy budgets during embryonic, larval, and juvenile life stages of fish and invertebrates.  The early life stages are frequently the most sensitive stages to sub-lethal stresses.  Documenting changes in energy allocation between the  metabolic costs of reproduction and body somatic growth in the early life stages, as well as reproductive effort of adults in producing egg and sperm will provide critical information for understanding: population level changes in larval survival and growth (recruitment success); species survival; and population and system production in response to variability, cycles, and eutrophication events in marine environments.\r\n",
