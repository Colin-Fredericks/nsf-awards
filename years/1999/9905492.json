 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to explore the interplay of recognition and redox processes, extending observations from the realm of host-guest chemistry into the arena of self-assembled monolayer surfaces (SAM's).  Assembled on a gold surface, these SAM's will be subject to a variety of characterization methods including grazing angle infrared spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.  Chemical modification of the surface will provide redox-functionalized moieties with the capability of binding specific guest molecules.  Subsequent redox chemistry will be studied in order to assess the feasibility of fabricating such devices as a molecular \"shuttle\" and to explore control of surface properties such as charge and hydrophobicity/philicity.  Ultimately, the creation of electronically responsive materials and devices may be possible.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Vincent Rotello of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Professor Rotello's research involves the rational design of surfaces on a molecular level, using molecular assemblies that are electrically active.  The principles that are identified in these experiments may find applications in new electronic devices based on the controlled formation of surfaces with predetermined structures and properties that respond to electrical stimuli.\r\n\r\n",
