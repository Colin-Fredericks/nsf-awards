Unfortunately, repeated maintenance usually has a deleterious effect on software quality.  As a result, it is sometimes necessary to reimplement (redesign and recode) part of a software product before additional maintenance can be performed on that part of the product.  Multiple versions of a telecommunications package written in C have been acquired.   The data for the proposed research consist of numerous versions of 155 files of C code.  The effect of repeated maintenance on each of the files is investigated.  Special attention is paid to maintenance activities that precede reimplementation in order to determine precisely how a portion of a software product becomes unmaintainable.  In particular, when reimplementation of a portion of a product has occurred, the coupling within that portion is examined over the lifetime of that portion, both before and after the reimplementation.  The hypothesis that is tested is that suboptimal coupling is a major cause of poor maintainability.  The results of this research will contribute to reduction of software maintenance and hence to lower software costs.\r\n",
