 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to support a workshop on research needs and opportunities for urban underground facilities, to be held at the conclusion of the Third National Geo-Institute Conference entitled, \"Geo-Engineering for Underground Facilities\", June 13-17, 1999, University of Illinois- Urbana.\r\n\r\nThe increased urbanization, population density, and traffic congestion in major urban centers in the United States is leading to a greater demand for underground space, such as new subway systems, below-ground highways, sewer tunnels, and deep parking garages.  These facilities are being constructed in heavily built environments, in confined construction areas, in difficult ground conditions, and adjacent to many structures that can tolerate only minimum disturbance.  The owners, designers, and contractors face many challenges in realizing these facilities under often-difficult constraints.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will identify some of the more pressing issues that are facing the engineering profession.  This will assist researchers in choosing research topics that address problems of concern to practicing professionals.  The workshop is aimed at stimulating a discussion within the engineering practice and academia to identify research priorities and needs in the geotechnical engineering aspects of urban underground construction.\r\n",
