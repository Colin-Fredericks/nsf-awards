 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kron's laboratory uses a simple eukaryotic cell, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to ask how organisms coordinately control cell shape and cell proliferation as they respond to environmental stimuli. Proper cell shape requires control over the organization of the cytoskeleton and of interactions between cells and their surroundings.  Progress in the cell division cycle must be tied to availability of nutrients and to cell growth.\r\n\r\nIn this CAREER proposal, Dr. Kron focuses on the filamentous growth response to nitrogen starvation, a model developmental switch in yeast.  Nitrogen-starved yeast undergo a dimorphic switch and grow in chains of cells that extend out from the colony center, foraging for nutrient.  Filamentous cells are distinct from cells that grow on rich media.  They form long tubular buds rather than small round buds.  This may result from the long period of bud growth before onset of mitosis and the marked polarization of actin and secretion to the bud tip during the budded period.  Previous work revealed a MAP kinase signaling pathway that receives the nitrogen starvation signal and induces the dimorphic switch but the link from signal to altered cell cycle progression and polarized growth remained unclear.  Now, manipulation of the cell cycle machinery has shown that it is necessary for the MAPK pathway to turn off the cell cycle kinase Cdc28 and delay mitosis to induce filamentous differentiation.  Remarkably, a simple delay in mitosis is sufficient to induce cells to polarize and differentiate into filamentous cells even without a MAPK signal.  These results establish a path from signal to cell cycle to polarity.\r\n\r\nDr. Kron's career development goals are to use budding yeast and the filamentous growth response as a model system with which to reveal molecular connections linking cell shape and cell division and as a teaching tool with which to show young scientists how decisive experiments expose order behind complex phenomena.  Toward this end, the research section of this proposal addresses two open questions: 1) How does the MAPK signal impinge on the cell cycle machinery? and 2) How does the cell cycle machinery control cell polarization?  Dr. Kron proposes to identify mutations in Cdc28 that block signal transduction from the MAPK pathway to the cytoskeleton.  He will then seek genes that when overexpressed can repair the defects in signaling and polarization.  These will be tested to determine whether they are the missing links that connect signal to cell cycle or cell cycle to cytoskeleton.\r\n\r\nThe teaching section focuses on the hypothesis that for promising young biology students to bloom into successful researchers, they should learn about research early in their undergraduate careers.  Dr. Kron will teach a course to first-year students who have 'placed out' of introductory courses based on outstanding secondary school preparation.  This course will focus on teaching how science moves forward rather than on listing what has already been done.  Dr. Kron will bring students and postdoctoral fellows from his own and colleagues' research groups to join him in the classroom and laboratory to describe and demonstrate their own work as examples.  The students will discuss current literature, perform experiments with unknown outcomes and complete the course with mini-projects drawn from Dr. Kron's studies of yeast growth and development.  Finally, the students will be offered the opportunity to continue their work with Dr. Kron or to begin research in other laboratories at the university as a start on their research careers.\r\n",
