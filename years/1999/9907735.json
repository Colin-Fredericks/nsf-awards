 "awd_abstract_narration": "9907735\r\nKirby\r\n\r\nThis project has developed techniques to translate research data sets and numerical models into three-dimensional interactive computer visualizations.  These innovative visualizations represent one of the most effective ways to integrate research into all levels of elementary, secondary, and undergraduate geoscience education.  The visualizations run on personal computers so that educational institutions, Independent Study and Distance Learning programs can use them.  The visualization modules can effectively expand geoscience education well beyond traditional lecture and lab settings and allow students to manipulate data sets in a manner that has previously been limited to research environments.  The current projects expands these visualization efforts into a number of new research areas, translates additional data sets for educational purposes and develops partnerships with existing geoscience initiatives to disseminate the materials and develop K-12 versions of the undergraduate modules.  The project will produce three new computer modules centered about visualizations of research data sets and quantitative models.  These visualizations are integrated into text, animations, and still images that provide background for the visualizations, a framework in which to explore the material, and establish the relevance of the material to modern Earth Systems and human society.  The modules are specifically designed to cross traditional discipline boundaries and tie diverse subjects together.  This gives the modules a unique pedagogical perspective compared to more traditional course materials.  A flexible format greatly expands the modules utility, allows them to be used as visuals in a lecture, self-guided students tutorials or resource material.  The modules can be distributed over the Internet or as  CD-ROMs.  They will work on Macintosh or Windows-based personal computers and are in HTML format so the materials run on commercial browsers.  This technology allows the material to be presented in a computer environment that is already familiar to students and educators.  Reliance on commercial software and Internet technology also maximizes the accessibility and longevity of the materials.\r\n",
