With a few\r\nexceptions, most of the rock masses that engineers deal with are influenced\r\nto some extent or another by discontinuities.  While we understand much\r\nabout the mechanical properties of intact solid rock, our understanding of\r\ndiscontinuous rock is significantly less well developed.\r\n\r\nConventional wisdom indicates that for adequate characterization, data must\r\nbe collected using surface mapping.  Tools and models are designed for this\r\napproach.  As a result drilling (borehole) data, which as the mainstay of\r\ngeologic exploration is omnipresent, is typically under-utilized.  Oriented\r\nborehole data however has the advantage of being easier and more cost\r\neffective to obtain.  Drilling can provide access to rock at depth and at\r\nthe precise locations where the data is needed.  Drilling data is an\r\nintegral and routine part of early site investigations, so it is almost\r\nalways available. Analysis is however not routine, largely because of the\r\nlack of useful analysis tools which can make use of the measured data and\r\nincorporate it into a model with practical value.\r\n\r\nA new analysis tool being developed, incorporates the various attributes of\r\nthe discontinuities in a multivariate analysis, and uses multi-dimensional\r\nclustering to identify joint sets and geological/ geomechanical domains\r\n(statistically homogeneous regions with respect to geological structure).\r\nThe method will make use of both statistical analysis and three-dimensional\r\nvisualization tools, in an integrated and automated package of computer\r\nalgorithms.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
