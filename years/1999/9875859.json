 "awd_abstract_narration": "Image-based rendering (IBR) is a new approach to computer graphics in which the underlying mode used to represent an environment is composed of a set of images rather than a collection of geometric primitives with associated surface properties. IBR offers several advantages over traditional computer graphics approaches.  First, image-based representations allow users to graphically explore objects and scenes that are captured from the real world. Second, these representations may be captured directly using digital cameras that exist today and which will become more prevalent in the future.  Finally, the display algorithms for IBR require modest computational resources, making them practical on desktop computers.\r\n\r\nThis research plan will address several major challenges in image-based rendering. The first is the development of new algorithms to overcome the limitations of existing image-based rendering techniques including: reducing the dependence of these algorithms on correspondence information, extending IBR techniques to accommodate dynamic environments, devising techniques to support immersive scene representations, and devising compact view-dependent representations. A second set of challenges that will be addressed is the automatic acquisition of image-based scene representations. This will be done by tightly coupling an array of randomly accessed image sensors with the computational elements required to generate the desired rendering. The benefit of this approach is that it can be architected to handle real-time scenes while making optimal use of available communication bandwidth and performing the minimum computation necessary. The third challenge addressed by this research is the need for high-performance image-based rendering hardware. The history of computer graphics has taught us that getting systems into the hands of early application developers is crucial to the field's development because it provides important feedback that shapes the future research agenda. High-performance hardware is a key step toward placing IBR techniques into the hands of application developers.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will benefit many different areas such as remote telepresence for deep-water or interplanetary exploration and medical applications. The research will also provide a new generation of tools for special effects in the motion picture industry, visual impact studies, architectural visualizations, military simulators, and video games.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
