Clark, Duke University\r\nCMS-9908271\r\nIndustrial / University Collaboration for Research in Control of Sound and Vibration\r\nThe Adaptive Systems and Structures Laboratory of Duke University and the Millennium Technologies Group of the Lord Corporation have jointly identified critical technical research objectives regarding advancements in the control of sound and vibration.  The programmatic objective is aimed at the successful integration of research efforts at the Lord Corporation and Duke University with regards to the control of sound and vibration.  The program aims to facilitate the transfer of technology and ideas between the academic and industrial setting through an integrated and collaborative research program.  The technical objective of the proposed program is focused on the advancement of transducer technologies and controller design methodologies required for structural control of sound and vibration.\r\nThe proposed program will have a significant impact within the field of applied control of sound and vibration.  New methods will be developed for determining optimal positions of transducers based upon experimental system identification techniques.  The method proposed will lead to a design methodology of value to the general community.  Additionally, practical issues facing the integration of self-sensing transducers will be addressed to facilitate technology transfer and determine limits of performance for applications requiring induced strain transducers.  For practical realization of multivariable control, self-tuning or adaptation is a necessity due to the variation in transducer dynamics, structural dynamics, and system parameters with each application.  Thus, to provide practical design guidelines, adaptive control methodologies will also be explored with an emphasis on determining limits of performance and robust stability given a basic knowledge of the time-varying parameters of the system.\r\n\r\n",
