 "awd_abstract_narration": "While scholarship on the political control of bureaucracy has long recognized the importance of administrative structures to policy outcomes, there exists limited empirical evidence of strategic actions actually taken by various actors in this regard.  In this Dissertation Support Research project the student elaborates a \"structural policy making framework,\" placing organized interest groups as central catalysts to policy change, evolution, and focus.  The framework identifies the design, of, and utilization of, administrative arrangements as the two dimensions most central to policy outcomes.  In examining the linkages between a series of critical components of policy structure, inferences about the nature of strategic behavior and relative influence of various policy actors are drawn.   This project differs from prior work on bureaucratic control through administrative design mechanisms because of its effort to provide a systematic empirical account linking interest group strategic action to bureaucratic output.\r\n\r\nApplying the framework to American air quality regulation since 1990, the project measures characteristics of structural policy-making at both state and national levels.  The project provides tests of policy design, utilization, and performance outcomes.  It directly assesses the relative impact of competing policy actors in each of these areas, and possesses significant for scholarship on environmental regulation, interest group policy behavior, and federalism's impact on policy-making.\r\n",
