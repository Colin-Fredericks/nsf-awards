 "awd_abstract_narration": "The abnormal wing discs (awd) gene of Drosophila melanogaster was identified in a hybrid dysgenic screen for lethal mutations that interfere with the normal development of imaginal discs.  Although larvae homozygous for a null allele survive until the end of the third larval instar, the proliferation of imaginal tissues such as, imaginal discs, lymph glands and optic centers of the brain is severely reduced.  These mutant imaginal discs are not capable of differentiating adult structures when transplanted into metamorphosing larvae.  AWD, the polypeptide product of the awd gene, is the subunit of a hexameric protein that has nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP kinase) activity.  Killer of prune (Kpn) is an awd gene mutation which changes proline 97 to serine.  Although, Kpn mutant homozygotes have only 30% of wild-type NDP kinase specific activity, they are viable and have no detectable morphological phenotype.  In a wild-type awd gene background, null mutations in the X chromosome prune (pn) gene cause an eye color phenotype but do not affect viability.  Nevertheless, in the absence of pn gene function, Kpn acts as a dominant larval lethal mutation.  Several years ago, a large scale mutagensis screen for unlinked suppressors of the pn/Kpn lethal interaction, failed to yield any suppressors.  To account for the failure to recover suppressors, it was hypothesized that the level of mutant protein that accumulates even in Kpn mutant heterozygotes was too great for any potential suppressor mutation to overcome.  So, a modified mutagenesis protocal was designed to screen for unlinked dominant suppressors using a Kpn transgene as the source of mutant protein.  Three suppressor mutations were recovered from this modified screen.  Incredibly, all three are recessive lethal alleles of a single third chromosome gene.  This gene was named su(Kpn) and localized by genetic recombination to proximal 3R; its cytogenetic location with 84C was determined by deletion mapping.  One objective of this research is to clone the su(Kpn) gene, determine the sequence of its transcript, identify the localization of its protein product, and assay for direct protein:protein interactions between AWD and SU(KPN) and/or between PN and SU(KPN).  Another objective is to examine the su(Kpn) lethal phenotype utilizing a detailed mosaic analysis to help elucidate the function of the su(Kpn) gene product.  Learning the identity of the suppressor gene product will help to understand the lethal interaction between prune and Killer of prune and the normal function of the awd gene. \r\n\r\nThe results of these experiments can give insight into developmental signaling pathways. The data thus far collected in this system suggests that the phenotypic defects are the secondary consequence either of the absence of a diffusible substance that is required for imaginal disc proliferation or to the presence of a diffusible substance that inhibits imaginal disc proliferation.  Analysis of the primary defect promises to provide new insight into the signaling that occurs between larval and imaginal cells.\r\n",
