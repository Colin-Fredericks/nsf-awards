 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT         This project will support improvements for the Marine  Vertebrates Collection of Scripps Institution of Oceanography,  University of California, San Diego. This collection has geographic  and bathymetric strengths unequaled elsewhere in the world. The  collection regularly supports extramural  research projects from a variety of investigators in the U.S. and  abroad. The  collection includes over 110,000 lots and 1.5 million specimens of  fishes from most  regions of the world ocean, with extensive and intensive geographic  coverage of the  Pacific.  The holdings of this collection became searchable on the  Internet in early  1996.         The Marine Vertebrates Collection, for the most part, is  currently in a building which has been declared seismically unfit.  In addition over 50,000 specimens are housed in a severely  inadequate, remote storage area exposed to temperatures as high as  34 C and extensive daily temperature variations. Open space in the  main area for new accessions and other purposes is almost non-  existent. In some cases, boxes of specimen jars are stacked on other  specimen jars on the shelves. Adding new, valuable material  frequently results in more specimens being transferred to the remote  storage area. Relocation of the Collection to a new facility is  essential.         Funds to construct a new building to replace existing Ritter  Hall have been provided to the University of California by the  State. After construction of the new building, Ritter Hall will be  demolished. Relocation of the collection provides an opportunity to  greatly enhance available storage space by utilization of compact  mobile shelvlng. This would allow all specimen to be housed in an  appropriate secure are and will provide for future growth.         The present project will support installation of compact mobile  and fixed shelving in this new building. Space-efficient means of  storage are necessary to house the collection in this building.",
