 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multimedia simulation, visualization and interactive animation programs and materials are being packaged into easy to understand top-level systems based on consumer products.  These consumer products are understandable by the general public and high school students. Semiconductor and photonic systems learning modules based on ubiquitous consumer products using the Java programming language and accessible on the world wide web (WWW) are being developed. These modules can be seamlessly integrated into a number of course syllabi that include the study of semiconductors, photonics, lasers and optics.  They are intended as stand-alone (self-learning) modules as well as educational aids for students in traditional courses.  Specifically, in this project the top-level case study modules and all component applets, where the component applets will serve as stand-alone simulation tools for the basic concepts as well as constituent parts for the case-study modules, are being developed, evaluated and effectively disseminated. Moreover, case-study modules based on an optical compact disc readhead system and on an optical barcode scanning system are being developed.\r\n\r\nThe developed applets and modules address audiences ranging from high school students and the general public through upper-level University students and even some in the research community.  More importantly, the tools developed here are accessible to all students that have access to the WWW and, in this way, have maximum impact to the teaching community throughout the country. In addition, each applet program developed is to be evaluated and disseminated through a paid-peer review by teaching professionals at different institutions than the principal investigators. It is expected that the modules and applets, developed here, will simplify and bring the scientific principles underlying today's high-tech devices closer to more students and the general public. \r\n\r\n",
