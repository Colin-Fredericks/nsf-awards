 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project to generate and map a large number (target is 10,000) of unique DNA sequences from the genetic code (genome) of bread wheat. The assumption is that these unique DNA sequences will correspond to individual genes of wheat and their identification is a first step in determining the function of these genes. The ultimate goal is to use this information to improve the quality and yield of wheat and enable successful adaptations to new and marginal environments, thus increasing production. Wheat belongs to a group of closely related species (termed a tribe, named Triticeae) in the grass family which includes more than 300 species, including several very important crops (bread and durum wheats, barley, rye, triticale) and several forage-grass species. World-wide, wheat is the most widely grown crop and the third in economic significance for the United States. The US is the largest wheat exporter in the world and, to maintain this market continuous genetic improvement of the crop is required. \r\n\r\nRecent advances in plant genetics and genomics offer unprecedented opportunities for discovering the function of genes and potential for their manipulation for crop improvement. Because of the large size of the wheat genome (the total DNA or genetic information of the species), it is unlikely that the actual base pair sequences of the DNA molecules will be learned completely in the near future. This project takes an alternative strategy to realize the benefits of new techniques for discovering genes and learning their function (functional genomics). Following the identification of 10,000 unique wheat DNA sequences (termed ESTs, Expressed Sequence Tags), they will be mapped to their physical location on the chromosomes of wheat. This process utilizes a unique feature of the wheat chromosomes, their ability to tolerate deletions of portions of the chromosomes and still produce a viable plant. The mapping logic is direct: if an EST is present in a plant with complete chromosomes, but absent in a plant missing a known part of a single chromosome, then it can be inferred that the DNA sequence that corresponds to that EST is located in that segment of the chromosome. By the end of the mapping component of this project, a most valuable tool will have been produced: 10,000 unique DNA sequences, likely corresponding to genes, whose physical location in the chromosomes of wheat are known. This sets the stage for the next phase of the project, the analysis of this array of mapped ESTs to determine function. The project will focus on characteristics of the wheat reproductive stages, from flowering signals through seed development and dormancy. The information gathered on the sequence, function, and position of these genes in the wheat chromosomes will be collected and distributed by means of a USDA public database of genomics information (known as GrainGenes). Because of the close relationship of wheat to other species in the Triticeae tribe and other grass species, especially corn and rice, the results from this project will be immediately applicable to other crops in the Triticeae. Most of the collaborating investigators are already collaborating members of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative which has produced molecular genetic maps of the chromosomes of wheat and related species. The diversity of experimental techniques and traits pursued in the individual laboratories collaborating on this project will be an ideal training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists. The large pool of well-characterized and mapped unique DNA sequences, available in the public domain will be an exceedingly important resource for future Triticeae research and basic functional genomics research.\r\n",
