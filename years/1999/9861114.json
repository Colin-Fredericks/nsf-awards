 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861114\r\n    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project could greatly increase accuracy of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations. Practical CFD calculations require models for approximating the effects of turbulent flow structure. Turbulence models exist, but there is a need for more robust, computationally efficient, and easy-to-use turbulence models applicable to wide classes of aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic flow problems. The proposed work addresses this need through the development and validation of a unique new approach to turbulence modeling to provide a step increase in the accuracy of CFD calculations with a computational cost comparable to much less vigorous existing turbulencemodels. The new turbulence model will be integrated with a proven turbomachinery CFD code and validation performed against published, measured, and DNS data, as well as laser velocimeter data to be collected from an annular diffuser test rig. This work will develop the model and validate its effectiveness specifically for turbomachinery flows. It is expected that this advanced turbulence model will also be applicable to a wide range of other flow conditions. These could include flows around airfranies, engine ducting, control surfaces, etc., plus general flows involving such phenomena as transition, rotation, separation, convection heat transfer, skin friction, mixing, and combustion.\r\n    The proposer is an established publisher of design software tools for the turbomachinery industry, with users such as Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, AlliedSignal, and Nuovo Pignone. The subject turbulence model will first be commercialized through integration into an existing CFD product. In addition to direct software sales, other potential revenue sources are licensing fees and contract work to further improve and enhance the subject model and/or implement and test it in other solver/model combinations, including unstructured-grid solvers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
