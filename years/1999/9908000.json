 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brownsville Urban Systemic Program (BUSP) plans to enhance its current infrastructure for K-12 science and mathematics education and transition to full implementation of standards-based instruction in order to improve significantly K-12 student achievement.  The Brownsville Independent School District (BISD) plans: (1) to implement a comprehensive standards-based, inquiry-centered mathematics and science curriculum districtwide through refinement of existing standards-based curricula, instruction, and assessment, infusion of technology, and establishment of new policies in support of science and mathematics education; (2) to increase the competency of the instructional workforce through sustained professional development and technical assistance; (3) to establish partnerships designed to empower the number of skilled entrants to the technology-based workforce through improved agreements with existing partners and new agreements with manufacturing companies; and (4) to improve teaching practice and student learning through research and evaluation.  \r\n\r\nIn order to reach this end, the School District plans: (1) to appoint 28 mentor teachers to serve as mathematics and science reform catalysts districtwide; (2) to implement the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) change model to increase access to rigorous, academic, college-preparatory courses for disadvantaged students; (3) to implement a comprehensive professional development program for teachers and school leaders focused on content, teaching practices, and instructional resources; and (4) to provide additional learning opportunities for students through subject coaching, advanced summer academies, enrichment activities, and family learning.",
