 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last decade has been one of unparalleled attention to transforming undergraduate SMET programs, accompanied by an extraordinary commitment of financial support, time, energy, and expertise of individuals and institutions across the scientific and educational communities.  In order to make a timely public accounting of this investment, this project is engaged in preparing and printing a synthesis report entitled; \"Are New Approaches Making a Difference?  To Whom, and How Do We Know?  A Report to the Community.\"\r\n\r\nThe report will identify individuals and institutions leading the Nation in developing, implementing, and assessing new approaches in classrooms and labs, and analyze and report on their efforts.  The report will illustrate with data how students are learning more effectively as they take responsibility for their own learning.  It will describe how new spaces are emerging that support improved learning communities and better accommodate new educational technologies.  It will report how faculty careers are enhanced through their efforts to integrate research and education.  \r\n\r\nThe publication is expected to be completed in time for distribution before the major gathering to be held in the Washington, DC area in the Fall of 1999 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Project Kaleidoscope and to anticipate the next decade of reform in undergraduate science, mathematics, engineering, and technology.  The intended audience for the publication, however, is far greater than the 1,000 persons expected to attend.  It includes all those with a stake in ensuring that the undergraduate SMET community serves the interests of students and society; parents and alumni; elected officials in local and national governments; and leaders in academic, corporate, foundation, and industrial communities.  \r\n\r\nThe publication is drawing on new data gathered from leading reformers, the experience and expertise of an editorial board, an analysis of files assembled by Project Kaleidoscope over the past decade, and materials and data emerging from programs supported the National Science Foundation and public and private funders of improvements in undergraduate education.",
