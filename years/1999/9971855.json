Weiss) to study the unstable\r\nhomotopy of such spaces as spheres and classifying spaces of compact\r\nLie groups.  Calculus of functors allows one to introduce certain\r\n``derivatives'' of homotopy groups.  If one understands these\r\nderivatives well, one can use them to recover a lot of information\r\nabout unstable homotopy theory (this is analogous to the fact that if\r\none knows all the derivatives of an ordinary function at a point, one\r\ncan often recover a lot of information about the function by means of\r\nTaylor series).  The derivatives are really objects of stable homotopy\r\ntheory, and they normally come equipped with interesting symmetries of\r\ncertain classical groups, such as the symmetric or orthogonal groups\r\n(division by the action of the symmetric group corresponds to division\r\nby n! in ordinary Taylor series).  Thus calculus allows one to reduce\r\nquestions about unstable homotopy theory to questions about\r\nequivariant stable homotopy theory.  This does not yield an effective\r\nmethod for calculating homotopy groups (there probably is no such\r\nmethod), but it does allow one to make interesting qualitative\r\nstatements about the global structure of homotopy theory.  Analyzing\r\nthe derivatives of different objects, together with the accompanying\r\nsymmetries, has been the focus of much of Arone's work.  These\r\nderivatives seem to be very interesting objects on their own, and\r\nstudying them involves combining methods from stable homotopy theory,\r\nequivariant topology, and group cohomology in fresh and unexpected\r\nways.\r\n     Many basic questions in mathematics, and in topology, in particular,\r\nare of the following form: given two objects, describe the possible\r\nfunctions between them.  For instance, one can ask to describe the\r\nspace of continuous maps between two topological spaces, or the space\r\nof embeddings of a circle into some physical space (this is informally\r\nknown as the space of ``knots'').  These questions are usually very\r\ndifficult.  This is so because the dependence of the space of\r\nfunctions on the source and the target is very complicated.\r\nInformally, one could say that the space of functions is a complicated\r\nfunction of two variables.  It turns out that, in analogy to ordinary\r\ndifferential calculus, one can develop a theory of ``Taylor series''\r\nof sorts for this kind of function and use it to approximate\r\ncomplicated spaces such as function spaces by simpler spaces, in\r\nmuch the same way as an ordinary function can be approximated by its\r\nTaylor polynomials.  This very striking idea was conceived by\r\nT. Goodwillie.  Much of Arone's work has focused on understanding the\r\n``Taylor polynomials'' and the ``Derivatives'' in this context.  This\r\nhas proved to be a fascinating and rewarding journey, which has\r\nalready led to interesting new results in (algebraic) topology.  Some\r\nof the results are of such a universal nature that there is at least a\r\nslight hope that this work will have an impact on mathematics outside\r\nhardcore algebraic topology.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
