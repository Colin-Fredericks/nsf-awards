The project has been funded for the time period 1998-2001.  The project involves 17 investigators from 12 universities. One of the major goals of the CD-ROM project is to understand how Laramide structures may have been influenced by older continental assembly structures and how Laramide upper crustal shortening is accommodated in the lower crust and upper mantle.  \r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator of this project is a recognized expert in Laramide tectonics.  His studies will strengthen the CD-ROM project by carrying out detailed analyses of Laramide structural geometries and sequences of events along the CD-ROM transects.  This is important to the success of the project because the effects of Laramide tectonism must be identified to discriminate their signatures from those of older (Precambrian) and younger (Rio Grande rift) events that have also contributed to the present lithospheric structure of the western part of the North American craton.  In addition, he can provide valuable advice to the project about exactly where to site the seismic lines in the transects so as to maximize information about Laramide basement-involved intracratonic tectonism.\r\n***\r\n",
