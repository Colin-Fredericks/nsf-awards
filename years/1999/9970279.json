 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports activities of the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility (AMGRF) at Florida State University. AMGRF, the largest repository of Southern Ocean piston cores in the world, has been supporting marine geological research and receiving, describing, and archiving cores for over 30 years. The AMGRF holdings include more than 20,000 m of cored sediment (over 6500 cores). The Facility also archives more than 2000 m of rotary-cored material from programs such as the Dry Valley Drilling Project, Cenozoic Investigations of the Ross Sea, and the Cape Roberts Project. This unique collection of sediments is especially important because of the Cenozoic paleoenvironmental record it preserves for the largely inaccessible Antarctic continent and surrounding ocean. During the past decade scientific attention has focused increasingly on the role of Antarctica in the evolution of global Cenozoic climate, especially as it pertains to the global warming controversy.\r\n\r\nThe AMGRF provides numerous functions for the Antarctic and Earth Science research communities including:\r\n\r\n(1) Technical Service - Core descriptions, sampling, and technical support to Principal Investigators (including shipboard or Antarctic land-based curatorial operations).\r\n\r\n(2) Core Curation - Marine piston and gravity cores from USAP vessels and land-drilled cores are processed and stored at the Facility\r\n\r\n(3) Core and Sample Database - An online core and sample database provides investigators with basic information about available cores and samples taken from the cores. \r\n\r\n(4) Research Support - Equipment and space for AMGRF and visiting investigators.\r\n\r\n(5) Education - AMGRF provides a useful venue for workshops and short courses for investigators and training for graduate and undergraduate students plus lectures and tours for students of all ages and the general public.\r\n\r\nThis award provides funds to continue, and improve, these research support efforts for the benefit of the U.S. and international research communities with interests in Antarctic marine geology.\r\n",
