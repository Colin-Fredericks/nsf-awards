 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hall NSF project: Chromatin potentiation and ABA activation of phaseolin transcription A rotationally and translationally-positioned nucleosome over the TATA region of the phaseolin (phas) promoter in leaf tissue confers a transcriptionally inactive chromatin structure. Transition to a transcriptionally competent status requires two major steps: chromatin potentiation and ABA-mediated activation. In this project, the processes involved in these steps will be examined in greater detail through the following specific objectives: (1) An investigation of the mechanisms involved in PvALF-mediated chromatin potentiation of the phas promoter; (2) A determination of the role of PvALF domains in transcriptional activation; (3) An examination of combinatorial cis-element interactions and their role in ABA-mediated activation of the phas promoter. In objective (1), the effect of DNA replication on phas activation will be investigated using dividing and non-dividing tissues, in the presence and absence of DNA replication inhibitors. An inducible promoter will be used to evaluate the effect of DNA replication on PvALF's ability to potentiate transcription in cells of young or old leaves which have, respectively, active or no DNA replication. Other systems to be used for exploration of phas promoter potentiation and activation include artificial nuclei made from Xenopus extracts in the presence and absence of plant nuclear factors (including native and modified PvALF). In objective (2), the role of the A and B2 domains of PvALF in transcriptional activation will be evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. The interaction of PvALF with specific RY elements will be evaluated in vegetative tissues and in seed tissues using isogenic lines bearing phas promoter RY element mutations and containing (or lacking) PvALF.  DNase I and DMS footprinting will be undertaken in vivo to determine phas promoter chromatin structure and factor occupancy in tissues of these lines. Experiments in objective (3) will permit evaluation of the ability of RY elements to interact with adjacent elements to yield functional transcription factor combinations. Additional phas promoter constructs will be used to explore the participation of specific sequence elements in ABA-mediated transcriptional activation.\r\n\r\nThe phas promoter, which drives strong and rigorously tissue- (seed) specific gene expression, is proving to be widely used in plant biotechnology. Therefore, findings from this project will have practical application as well as providing a plant system for studying the fundamental biological process of transcription. Confirmation of the participation of replication in transcriptional activation would represent a major scientific advance since no one has thus far illustrated convincingly that replication is directly involved in the transcription of a higher eukaryote gene.\r\n",
