These problems have also\r\nintrinsic mathematical value; they will be treated rigorously.\r\nMany of the projects listed in the proposal are related to Yang-\r\nMills theory ( in particular, supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory)\r\non noncommutative spaces and to duality in this theory. The PI is\r\nplanning to exploit the relation between Morita equivalence and\r\nduality discovered in his recent papers with the goal to\r\nunderstand dualities in gauge theories, string theory and\r\nM-theory and to give rigorous treatment of these dualities.  It\r\nwas shown in recent paper by A. Connes, M. Douglas and A.Schwarz\r\nthat noncommutative tori arise naturally in the problem of\r\ncompactification of M-theory ( in Matrix formulation of this\r\ntheory).  The PI intends to study noncommutative deformations of\r\nother Poisson manifolds and compactifications of M-theory on\r\nnon-flat noncommutative spaces.  Other projects are related to\r\napplications of supergeometry to various problems of quantum\r\nfield theory, including general problem of quantization of gauge\r\ntheories and topological quantum field theory.\r\n\r\nFor several years superstring theory was considered as a\r\ncandidate for a theory describing all interactions that exist in\r\nthe Nature.  Now we know that superstring theory is not complete;\r\nit should be extended to a more general theory, containing not\r\nonly strings, but also their multidimensional analogs\r\n(branes).This general theory was named M-theory; it was\r\nconjectured that M-theory can be formulated as a matrix model (so\r\ncalled M(atrix) theory). It was shown recently by PI and by other\r\nscholars that the methods of noncommutative geometry are very\r\nuseful in the analysis of M-theory, especially in M(atrix)\r\nformulation of this theory. The PI is planning to work further in\r\nthis direction; in partucular, he studies the energy spectrum and\r\ndualities in the framework of noncommutative geometry.\r\n",
