 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous theoretical work by this group has suggested specific roles for stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) in several essential biological activities. These include the mecha-nisms of activation of two families of superhelically regulated genes in prokaryotes (those regulated by integration host factor (IHF) binding, and those of the SOS system), and in the attachment of eukaryotic chromosomal DNA to the nuclear scaffold. Experiments performed by collaborators have verified our predictions and documented the role of SIDD in these (and other) regulatory events. This entirely new approach has provided crucial insights into the mechanisms of regu-lation of several biological processes. In particular, it has resolved a long-standing dilemma by elucidating the molecular basis for several regulatory mechanisms whose active sites exhibit no clear sequence homologies. This success has sparked a growing interest in examining whether SIDD may play roles in other events for which the molecular basis is not completely understood at present.\r\n\r\nThe currently proposed research program will build on these efforts in three directions. To enable scientists at other academic institutions to efficiently assess the SIDD properties of genomic regions, we will develop a Web site where researchers can submit sequences for automated analysis. This will require substantial modifications to the existing analysis programs to maximize their applicability, flexibility and user-friendliness. We will extend our ongoing collaboration with Dr. Wes Hatfield (UC Irvine) to investigate the roles of superhelicity and SIDD in prokaryotic transcriptional regulation. And we will continue to investigate the role of SIDD in eukaryotic scaffold attachment in collaboration with Dr. Jurgen Bode at the GBF in Braunschweig, Germany.\r\n\r\nIn the latter collaboration we will determine how the amount of destabilization experienced and the extent of the destabilized region correlate with the experimentally measured strength of scaffold binding. This will elucidate the precise SIDD properties that are involved in bind-ing. We will test the valldity of these conclusions by predicting binding activities from the SIDD properties of destabillzed sites in the human IFN gene cluster, then comparing these results to the experimentally measured binding strengths. Using these results we will develop computa-tional methods to search genomic DNA sequences for scaffold attached regions (SARs) based on their SIDD properties. This will provide the first method for inferring chromosomal organization directly from DNA sequence.\r\n\r\nThe ongoing collaboration with Dr. Wes Hatfield will extend our original studies of the role of superhelical DNA destabilization in the activation of the IHF-regulated ilvPG operon promoter. We will investigate whether other IHE-regulated genes have the SIDD properties found to be central to the mechanism of activation of this operon. And we will investigate the destabilization properties and other attributes of all the genes in the E. coli genome that expression chip experiments (to be performed by Dr. Hatfield) show are regulated either by IHF or by superhelicity. This will provide the first complete assessment of the range of mechanisms by which DNA superhelicity exerts transcriptional regulatory effects in prokaryotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n",
