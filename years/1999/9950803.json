 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project a seven college collaboration is integrating inquiry-based learning, mathematical modeling and technology into the mathematics curriculum.  These seven colleges, which represent a subset of the New York State Coalition (NYSC) of some 30 two and four-year colleges, are adapting materials and educational practices developed by the principal investigators of NSF projects as well as other public and privately supported mathematics, science, and technology (MST) projects.  In particular, the colleges are adapting and implementing materials developed under the Mathematics Across the Curriculum projects.  The seven schools are SUNY Oswego, SUNY Farmingdale, SUNY Oneonta, SUNY Brockport, Adirondack Community College, St. John Fisher College and Alfred University.  Faculty and administrators at these institutions are committed to making institutional-wide change and are endorsing programmatic changes.\r\n\r\nThe expectations are to:  \r\n\r\n(a) increase faculty's knowledge of the content and pedagogy related to teaching and scholarship in mathematics and its application; \r\n\r\n(b) promote learning by inquiry in the context of mathematics, science and technology; \r\n\r\n(c) emphasize to faculty the importance of mathematical modeling in courses; \r\n\r\n(d) demonstrate how faculty in mathematics and in other disciplines can cooperate to develop interdisciplinary courses and instructional materials suitable for implementation at two and four-year schools; and \r\n\r\n(e) promote effective communication between two- and four-year institutions and users of mathematics in non academic environments.  \r\n\r\nThese expectations are being achieved by the collaborating group partnering with principal investigators of national projects to address the following themes:  Mathematical Modeling, Inquiry-Based Learning, Partnerships, Technology, and Programmatic Change.",
