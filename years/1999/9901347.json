The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Joseph Weingartner with support for twenty-four months to work with Drs. Peter Martin and Alex Lazarian at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Twelve months is being supported by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\nThis research will focus on the physics of interstellar dust, specifically in the construction of a dust model and the exploration of applications of gas-grain drift in photodissociation and ionized regions, as well as studying grain alignment.  An improved understanding of this dust will contribute to the elucidation of the structure and evolution of the galaxy and of the processes of star and planet formation.  The most basic goal in dust research is to accurately characterize the dust: its composition, size distribution, and shapes.  In addition to this research, Dr. Weingartner will study the interstellar medium and the star formation process.\r\nDrs. Martin and Lazarian are leaders in the study of the interstellar medium.  The host institution, CITA, offers fast computing facilities as well as a community of researchers in diverse areas of astrophysics.\r\n***\r\n",
