 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program of education and research merging four existing research groups into a new entity with broad technical expertise yet still sharing a focus on Neuro-mechanical systems. Each existing group has a history of collaboration between various engineering fields and the biological sciences. However, meaningful interactions only came after considerable effort to overcome barriers. The training program will provide a formal process to help graduate students proceed through that process quickly and efficiently. Students in the training program will participate in cross-disciplinary courses and rotate through laboratories in all four fields. A multidisciplinary seminar featuring extended visits from leaders in each field will draw students together. Funds will permit travel to scientific meetings and workshops in each field. A common computer facility and office area will maintain interactions beyond the classroom. Internships in clinical and industrial settings will also be available as options. We have also planned an aggressive recruitment program emphasizing institutions committed to training students in underrepresented groups. Our trainees will graduate with appropriate tools and background necessary to work efficiently in teams. We believe that such an experience will pay great dividends to both the students and the disciplines in which they choose to work.\r\n\r\nIGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options. IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research. In this second year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-one institutions for programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. This specific award is supported by funds from the Directorates for Biological Sciences, for Engineering, for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and for Education and Human Resources.\r\n",
