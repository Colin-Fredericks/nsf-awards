The researchers and their students will investigate the cultural models held by various stakeholder groups (farmers, watermen, environmental professionals, biological and agricultural scientists, and policymakers), linked through their involvement in efforts to improve water quality.  Using consensus analysis, a technique developed in cognitive anthropology, with a sample of 25-30 members of each group, the researchers will systematically document intra- and intercultural variation in beliefs and values regarding environmental pollution.  This project's theoretical and empirical focus is a continuation of exploratory research on the community and cultural consequences of Pfiesteria for farmers and watermen.  Project findings will be used to promote dialog between stakeholder groups on their similarities and differences in environmental knowledge, beliefs, values and practices.  An additional concern of the researchers is to assure the equal participation of under-represented groups, specifically farmers and watermen.  The project also continues developing a long-term applied research and training program at the University with a focus on preparing students to be practitioners as well as researchers.\r\n",
