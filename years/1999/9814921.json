 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports research to study the volcanism at Mount Erebus (on Ross Island), Antarctica's most active volcano. Mount Erebus is unique in hosting in its summit crater a persistent convecting lake of molten silica and alkali-rich phonolitic magma. Erebus is one of only a handful of volcanoes worldwide that exhibit nearly continuous small explosive activity and internal earthquake (seismic) activity. It is an ideal natural laboratory to study how gas is given off by magma and the earthquakes associated with a convecting magma conduit. The principal objective of this project is to better understand the nature and dynamics of the magmatic plumbing system, and  eruptions and degassing from the lava lake using a combination of seismic studies and gas emission rate measurements.\r\n\r\nThe gas studies are designed: 1) to examine the role of Erebus as a source of gas and aerosols to the Antarctic environment; 2) to understand the role of volcanism as a source of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, especially for a highly alkalic magma; 3) to understand the evolution of the main volatiles (water vapor, carbon dioxide, total sulfur, fluorine and chlorine) in the Erebus magmatic system and their role in the eruptive behavior of Erebus; and 4) to correlate the nature of the gas emissions with the observed seismic activity. A high priority will be to measure carbon dioxide emission rates in the plume and to determine soil gas carbon dioxide fluxes. The measurements of carbon dioxide emissions will provide some of the first available data on carbon dioxide degassing from a highly alkalic magma system. A special effort to measure lead emission rates will be made to evaluate the contribution of lead from Mount Erebus, relative to contributions from marine aerosols, to snow on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and to evaluate these sources relative to hypotheses of anthropogenic origins of lead.\r\n\r\nAn existing network of ten short-period seismic stations on Erebus provides daily, triggered and continuous digital data which are the backbone of routine observatory operations and are providing an important and accumulating base of events with which to investigate various aspects of the volcanic system. This project will undertake three specific avenues of seismic investigation of the volcano: 1) add a permanent broadband seismic station to the array and update the present data acquisition system; 2) deploy a temporary network of broadband stations to augment the results of a previous pilot study; and 3) expand development of current software to allow automatic and precise timing of earthquake occurrences and thus allow precise locations to be determined. This will permit refined collection of earthquakes for use in a computer model of the interior of the volcano. It will also provide a tool for the general volcanological community to use for volcano surveillance and for monitoring subtle changes in the internal behavior of a volcano and assist with eruption hazard monitoring. Using broadband data, this project plans to a) undertake a detailed study of the explosion mechanism and further investigate the very-long-period signals associated with explosions, and b) look for temporal and spatial variability in earthquake mechanisms and better understand seismic activity with respect to variations in gas emissions.\r\n\r\n",
