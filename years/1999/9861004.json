Network business \r\norganizations are a proposed solution to emerging economic needs; they enable business entities \r\nto compete in naturally monopolistic contexts. An example is an operating system where ownership\r\nhas a natural-even desirable-need to be a monopoly. The proposed change allows competition to\r\nindividual ownership by collective owners who compare for portions of the monopoly itself.  Our Research will proceed in three parts:  (1) Create a mathematical model describing traditional double entry bookkeeping; (2) Build a prototype bookeeping system in partnership with a local network group to     observe and document the special needs of network organizations; and (3) Create a software design for large scale implementation based upon our research at the local community level. Extend the local implementation to Internet groups. \r\n     Upon conclusions reached in our Phase I study and its documentation, Phase II will:  (1) build a first generation, Internet aware bookkeeping program; (2) add legal language essential to enforce contracts among members of a network organization;  and (3) continue empirical validation of the bookkeeping model, its software application  and its piecemeal growth.   Create a bookkeeping standard for intellectually competitive business entities that are optimized by the application of language which would otherwise generate a cultural monopoly.\r\n",
