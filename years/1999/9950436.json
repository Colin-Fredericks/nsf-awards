 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate students, especially those planning majors in non-science disciplines, frequently do not see mathematics as relevant to their education. They often find it difficult to comprehend the relevance of mathematical concepts in their chosen majors and the usefulness of mathematics for their educational development. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to improve the mathematics literacy of students majoring in the social sciences, behavioral sciences, and humanities by means of Web-based interdisciplinary and interactive lessons.  The project team also believes that the interactive lessons will enable the students to develop their critical thinking and quantitative skills, and to become better citizens. The Web-based (on-line) lessons are being developed by faculty educators in Mathematics, Business & Economics, Music, and Philosophy working together. \r\n\r\nThe project effort is a tri-institutional collaboration among Washington State University, the University of Idaho, and North Idaho College, a two-year institution.  The project is increasing the integration of technology in education and supporting faculty development. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
