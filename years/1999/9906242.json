 "awd_abstract_narration": "9906242\r\nPhule\r\n\r\nThis multi-university, cross-disciplinary industry-university collaborative (GOALI) proposal represents a well defined, coherent research plan to address some of the most significant scientific and technological challenges currently faced by the rapidly growing and highly competitive personal communication systems (PCS) industry. \r\n\r\nWe propose a two-prong approach that involves a combination of experimental and modeling researches to address these key challenges facing the US PCS industry. The first objective of this GOALI program to undertake systematic experimental investigations to unravel the DR materials processing issues. We will elucidate the processing-microwave property relationships for barium magnesium tantalate (BMT), an archetypal DR material. The processing of resonator materials has a profound influence on the quality (as defined by the microwave Q Tf , K) of the DR. At the present time, the BMT materials used for PCS base station filters are quite difficult and expensive to process. The processing of these materials is not well understood and utilizes a trial-and-error approach. Processing routes for achieving super-high Q DR require several days of processing in oxygen ambient and often result in unpredictable and large variations in the microwave properties, especially the Q factors. We will carefully investigate the fundamental-issues related to the processing of BMT materials and identify innovative routes that will result in high performance DR with controlled and more predictable microwave dielectric properties. The second objective is to develop practical, realistic computer design tools for virtual prototyping for PCS devices such as filters, multiplexes, and power dividers. At the present time, although the device structures for PCS are witnessing increasing levels of complexity, the tools for designing these devices remain quite modest in terms of their capability. Therefore, we will develop sophisticated, precise, and efficient numerical techniques for modeling complex guiding and resonant electromagnetic structures. Mode matching techniques for the determination of generalized scattering matrices of structures, that cannot be described by a single coordinate system (e.g., cylindrical obstacles in rectangular enclosures), will be developed and used. Significant cost savings can be realized and a trial-and-error approach, that involves several iterations of building an actual prototype, can be eliminated using the virtual prototyping tools we plan to create.\r\n\r\nPI's with considerable experience and complementary research are joining forces to conduct the proposed cross-disciplinary research. An active industrial collaboration (Trans-Tech, Inc. and Conductus Inc.) will constitute an important facet of this GOALI program. In addition to exchange of information and materials, frequent visits of students and faculty to industry (as well as reverse visits) will also positively impact this program. Special attention to the training of graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, especially those from underrepresented minorities and tapping every conceivable opportunity to integrate our research into the appropriate academic courses will be some of the other important dimensions of this program.\r\n\r\nIn the area of wireless technology the competition from foreign countries is intense. In this regard, our proposal is timely and will ultimately help further enhance the competitiveness of the United States in the area of devices for wireless communications. Our program addresses some of the most compelling needs of the PCS base station filter industry. This program will catalyze the development of novel and improved processing routes for DR materials and DR based devices. The new knowledge we expect to generate will serve as a tool for future commercial development of improved and innovative DR based devices for PCS. In addition to PCS, our ideas/findings would be exportable to such other areas as tunable filters using planar structures in superconducting materials and magnetic materials. Therefore, in the long run our program will have a broader impact on the area of wireless communications and the educational training of the next generation of scientists and engineers.\r\n***",
