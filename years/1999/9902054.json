 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to establish a new technology for attaining surface conductivity in polymers and polymer composites, without sacrificing mechanical integrity.  The use of conductive polymers in industrial applications ranges from molding compounds of green tires to exterior body parts of automobiles to plastic housing of computers, notebooks, and cellular phones.  The surface and bulk conductivity of conductive polymers help dissipate static electricity, facilitate spray painting, and expedite the rate of heat conduction. In current technology, the whole body of tires or exterior auto body parts is molded from conductive polymer compounds.  Only a small fraction of the 15 - 60% by weight of conductive particles remains near the surface.  Fabricating separate conductive surface layers in multi-layer articles requires advancing the fundamental knowledge of the molding technology and the material compositions. \r\n\r\nThis investigation will study the effective surface conductivity of molded polymer sheets and films as a function of the kinematics of molding conditions, composition, and particle-particle network formation. Experimental molding of simple shaped, two-layer composite laminates will be conducted to demonstrate the concepts and to evaluate the effective conductivity.  The research plan includes the development of viscosity-composition-conductivity diagrams to guide the selection of the composition of conductive compounds.  Improved understanding of the parameters governing the shape of the interface and the strength of interlayer bonding is expected, as well as selection criteria for materials to improve cost and productibility. \r\n\r\n",
