(Steve) Shen, University of Washington\r\nProposal Number:  CMS-9820745\r\nProposal Title:  Taming Vibration of Rotating Disk/Spindle Systems\r\nProject Abstract:\r\n For the past 3 years, the disk drive industry has tripled the track density and doubled the rotational speed to increase storage capacity and to reduce data access time.  As a result, disk and spindle vibration becomes a critical issue and a major concern.  In general, rotating disk/spindle systems present two types of vibration:  in-plane and out-of-plane.  To suppress the in-plane vibration, the industry is developing precision spindles with hydrodynamic bearings.  To suppress the out-of-plane vibration, the industry is developing alternative disk substrates such as laminated disks.  Because these developments are fairly recent, the industry has very little fundamental understanding, and knowledge bases are almost nonexistent at present.\r\nMotivated by these imminent needs, the proposed research is (a) to develop a mathematical model to predict vibration response of rotating disk/spindle systems with hydrodynamic bearings, and (b) to evaluate damping performance of alternative disk substrates subjected to high-speed spinning and rocking,  For hydrodynamic spindles, the research focus will be rotating-shaft design and nonlinear stiffness effects.  For alternative substrates, the research will address two most fundamental issues of laminated disks:  frequency-domain analysis and temperature effects.\r\nSuccess of the proposed research will provide the industry with fundamental understanding and knowledge bases to make important breakthroughs in these areas.  Results of the proposed research will also be useful to other industries that employ small, high-speed, and precision spindle motors, such as DVD (Digital Versatile Disks) industry.\r\n\r\n",
