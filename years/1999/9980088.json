 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the twenty-first century, biology will increasingly become an information science.  Recent startling advances in DNA sequencing technology have spurred dozens of major sequencing projects, ranging from important bacterial genomes to the Human Genome Project.  In between are projects to sequence the genomes of laboratory animals such as mice, plants such as the flowering plant Arabidopsis and various important food crops.  Enormous increases in the amount of available sequence data have produced a strong  demand for computational high throughput analysis.  Genomic sequence data will provide the basis for many important discoveries as we move into the next century, and new algorithms are vital to maximizing the scientific knowledge gleaned from this data. The fact that biological data is distributed all over the world presents additional problems for algorithms that need to be able to use all available knowledge sources to construct consistent theories.  The computer scientists working on this project have expertise in machine learning, computational biology, probabilistic reasoning, scientific databases and high performance computing.  The biologists include several key investigators  who have sequenced and analyzed eight completed bacterial genomes.  Their expertise covers DNA sequencing technology, sequence databases, molecular biology, genetics and biophysics.  This project will develop novel computer systems to support scientific discovery in large-scale genomic sequence databases. These systems will make sophisticated computational analysis an integral part of the process of developing, integrating and disseminating new scientific knowledge.  The results will enable new discoveries from the rich source of information embodied in genomic databases.\r\n",
