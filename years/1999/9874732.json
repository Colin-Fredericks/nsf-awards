 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kansas Science and Technology Advanced Research Program (K*STAR) enhances research competitiveness at the University of Kansas, Kansas State University and Wichita State University.  K*STAR programs:  link faculty members of these universities in cooperative research projects; provide shared major equipment resources; fund junior faculty early on to increase their competitiveness for federal grants; and stimulates formation of research partnerships among the university, state and private sectors.  Included are:  a New Faculty Hires component to plug gaps in the institutions' research staffing; Acquisition/Upgrading of Multi-user Instrumentation to allow all researchers increase the scope of research that can be conducted; and First Award grants to help early-career faculty become more competitive for extramural research funding.  Special Initiative Grants are one-time, opportunistic investments that include:  (a) assistance to foster nationally competitive, high-performance computing and networking capabilities; (b) partnerships between EPSCoR researchers and the private sector to effect technology transfer; (c) innovative programs in graduate education and human resource development that expand student career options and facilitate the entry of members of underrepresented groups into high-demand S&T fields; and (d) short-term visits to establish cooperative research links to industrial and/or national laboratories.  Planning Grants, meanwhile, allow faculty to develop innovative research proposals focused in areas designated as state and institutional R&D priorities.\r",
