The Society for Neuroscience, a scientific organization now with more than 28,000 members, played an integral role in this legislation.  The Society is presenting this Symposium to emphasize the accomplishments of this decade and look toward the future for the brain research the 21st Century.  Eminent neuroscientists, public officials, members of advocacy and educational groups and media representatives will come together to consider an overview of progress in understanding the nervous system.  There will be an emphasis on new technical and conceptual approaches to understanding the nervous system; on contributions of molecular, cellular, systems and behavioral biology to understanding brain dysfunction; and on perceptual function and developmental plasticity of the human brain.\r\n\r\nThis Symposium is likely to have a high positive impact on public and congressional awareness of basic neuroscience research, and so serves as major outreach activity as well as an update on scientific issues.\r\n",
