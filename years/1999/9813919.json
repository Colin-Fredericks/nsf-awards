 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813919\r\nFine\r\n\r\nThis program addresses the fundamental aspects of thermodynamics and kinetics of bulk and interfacial microstructural evolution in solder joints and how they affect creep of precipitation-strengthened lead-free solders.  The focus is on two areas:  (1) experimental characterization and simulation of microstructures in solder joints including the interfaces, and (2) creep studies of precipitation strengthened lead-free solders for higher-temperature applications. The effects of underbump metallizations on the kinetics of interfacial microstructures are investigated in the liquid and solid states of the solders. The metallizations of interest are Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd, and Pt, and the solders of interest are lead-free, as well as Pb-Sn binary solders.  Building on thermodynamic databases, a multicomponent mobility database and appropriate methodologies will be developed to facilitate the one dimensional growth simulation of interfacial microstructure using DICTRA software.  In addition, morphological analyses and simulation of microstructural dynamics will be performed using analytical and numerical techniques.  Fundamental understanding of the creep resistance, strength, and mechanics of interfaces between Cu6Sn5, Ag3Sn, InSb, Ni3Sn4 and SbSn precipitates and the Sn-matrix are sought. Elastic and plastic properties and the creep deformation kinetic parameters will be correlated with the microstructure of model alloys.  A mechanism is sought to explain why some intermetallics are more efficient than others in improving the creep resistance of solders.  The bulk creep properties will be correlated with the interface mechanics properties obtained through nano-indentation experiments.  Fracture tests in shear will relate failure to the solder and interface microstructure.  These results will improve the design methodology for advanced lead-free solders.\r\n\r\nIn electronic packaging solder joints provide electrical contact and mechanical support to interconnected components.  To achieve a higher density of connections in electronic devices, the trend in electronic packaging is to replace peripheral wire bonds with area array joints using solder bumps.  Underbump metallizations play a critical role in the evolution of interfacial microstructures.  Such information is lacking for lead-free solders.\r\n",
