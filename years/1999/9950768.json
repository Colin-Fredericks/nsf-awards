 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular biology is a unifying theme in the biological sciences and its first principles should be understood by all students of biology. Not surprisingly, an effective way to learn about molecular biology is to do molecular biology. However, the equipment infrastructure (not to mention reagents and disposable) needed to offer an authentic hands-on molecular biology teaching laboratory is staggering. Consequently, the theme of this proposal is to integrate the technology used in molecular biology into an undergraduate teaching laboratory that will be accessible to students in both \"molecularly\" oriented and \"non-molecularly\" oriented majors. Our current curriculum does not offer such a course.\r\n\r\n\r\nProp 9950768\r\n\r\nFTIR, Thermal Analysis and Molecular Modeling Systems for Materials Science Enhancement of the Undergraduate Physical Chemistry Laboratories\r\n\r\nChemistry (12)\r\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)/thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) instrumentation and improved computer/molecular modeling facilities are being used as a basis for modernizing our undergraduate chemistry laboratories and focusing increased attention on developments in materials science. These state-of-the-art instruments are being used to collect, analyze and display data. A number of experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education and from the research literature are being adapted to form a series of innovative, multidisciplinary physicochemical experiments in several advanced laboratories. The FTIR spectrometers, computers and molecular modeling software also are being used in the general chemistry labs for a unique environmental pollution experiment, as well as in a variety of undergraduate research projects. We intend through these experiences to further inspire and motivate Occidental's diverse student population by illustrating the wide range in which physical chemistry principles apply, especially in the under-represented but increasingly significant arena of materials science. We anticipate that the increased efficiency in data collection provided by this equipment will permit more time for student-student and student-mentor interactive learning to occur. Through discussion and course questionnaires, information will be collected and used to evaluate the program's ability to improve student laboratory confidence, as well as data-gathering and analysis skills. It is planned to share this experience through publication of a laboratory manual, presentations at chemical education meetings and through a Web site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
