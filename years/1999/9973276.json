 "awd_abstract_narration": "9973276\r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on several fundamental computational issues involved in the parallel implicit solution of partial differential equations arising from optimal control and the variational formulation of physical problems.  The goals of the research include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n    (1) The formulation and analysis of provably efficient, robust and scalable multilevel algorithms for the optimization and solution of systems defined by partial differential equations.\r\n\r\n    (2) The development of software embodying the above algorithms and its dissemination within the manufacturing, engineering and scientific community. The proposed software will extend the scope and effectiveness of the existing codes PLTMG, MC, and SNOPT that have been developed by the investigators at UC San Diego.\r\n\r\n    (3) The attraction of advanced graduate students into this research area, which generally concerns the analysis and computational study of systems arising in the sciences and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe investigators have combined expertise in optimization, numerical methods for partial differential equations, and parallel computation.  This research program is intended to provide graduate students with a broad educational experience in an environment in which these different aspects of scientific computation are integrated.  A key aim of the research is the transfer of new results to the manufacturing, engineering and scientific community.  Mathematical software is one of the most effective means of technology transfer.  Conversely, a crucial component of effective algorithm development is close association with engineers and scientists facing real-world problems.  The investigators will continue and broaden their collaboration with researchers in other areas of applied science and technology, including manufacturing, environmental modeling, electrical power optimization, biomolecular modeling, computer graphics, solid mechanics, aerospace and finance.  All these applications have benefited from and contributed to existing algorithms and software.\r\n\r\n",
