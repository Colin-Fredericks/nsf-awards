 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several theoretical models will be developed aimed at evaluating the welfare consequences of mergers and exclusionary practices that are motivated by the parties' attempt to improve their \"negotiating position\" vis-a-vis powerful business partners and customers.  (Exclusionary practices include things like clauses in contracts between two firms forbidding one of the firms from dealing with a third firm.)  In evaluating the recent mergers in the computer and telecommunication industries or in assessing the welfare consequences of exclusionary clauses utilized by Microsoft in contracting with its business partners, the Justice Department can benefit from such a \"negotiation\" based analysis of mergers. The existing literature on the topic is not very useful in this context since it assumes that the customers and suppliers of the merged entity are powerless, price-taking entities. In addition, it models sales of goods and services between upstream and downstream firms as \"spot exchange\" trades, rather than trades under contract. In contrast, in the present project explicit negotiations over contract terms among firms will be incorporated into the analysis. The implications of mergers (both horizontal and vertical) and of exclusionary clauses upon the outcome of the negotiations will be assessed. In particular, the objective is to understand the welfare consequences of such practices as a function of the relative extent of competitiveness of the industries in which the merged entity and its negotiating partners operate.\r\n     The following are examples of questions to be addressed in the project:\r\n1.  Under what circumstances do firms have incentives to vertically or horizontally integrate in order to      enhance their bargaining position in negotiations?\r\n2.  How do those circumstances relate to the characteristics of the markets in which they operate?\r\n3.  What are the welfare consequences of such mergers?\r\n4.  Under what circumstances do exclusionary practices arise in an attempt to enhance negotiating position? \r\n5.  Are such practices always welfare reducing?\r\n6.  Can asymmetric equilibria emerge where some firms resort to exclusionary practices while their      competitors do not?\r\n7.  What patterns of ownership can emerge at the equilibrium?  In particular, can asymmetric equilibria       exist, such that a subset of firms in an industry (or in two related industries) is jointly owned while the       remaining firms choose to operate independently?",
