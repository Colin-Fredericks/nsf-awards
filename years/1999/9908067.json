Geosynthetics include\r\ngeotextiles, geomembranes and many erosion control materials. All are used\r\nextensively in landfills to protect the environment. The development and use of\r\ngeosynthetics has been very rapid; so rapid, in fact, that the transfer of\r\nknowledge and experiences from designing and installing geosynthetics has not\r\nkept up with the rapid expansion of the market. The result is needless\r\nfailures. If the experience of others had been shared and publicized, in a\r\ncommon document, many failures could have been avoided. This is especially true\r\nin the use of geosynthetics, particularly geomembranes, in landfills.\r\n\r\nA workshop with resulting documents is proposed. Non-partisan\r\nexperts in\r\nthe use of landfill geomembranes will attend and share experiences in an open\r\nenvironment. They will discuss current problems and focus on better solutions.\r\nThe workshop title is Geomembrane testing and remediation technologies -\r\ntesting\r\nof geomembrane materials, seams, and installed lining systems, and the repair\r\nof leaks in the latter.\r\n\r\n        The workshop goals are:\r\n\r\n1.      develop a state-of-practice paper \r\n2.      provide a vision for the profession on where new knowledge/research is\r\n         needed on this subject and how to get it\r\n3.      provide a model for other organizations (such as the ASCE\r\nGeo-Institute)\r\nto hold similar workshops/brainstorming sessions.\r\n\r\n        After the state-of-practice paper ((1) above) is complete, ten expert\r\nprofessionals will attend a 2.5-day workshop at Auburn University in Auburn,\r\nAL, to share experiences and discuss the needs of the profession in this area.\r\nThe meeting results will be a paper on the needs of the profession on the\r\nsubject for the coming five years.\r\n*** \r\n\r\n",
