Nair\r\nInstitution:  \t\tUniversity of Missouri-Columbia\r\nProposal Number:\t9979234\r\nTitle:\t\t\tReduced Order Aeroelastic Dynamic Modeling of Flexible Airplanes\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Abstract:\r\n\r\nThe objective of this GOALI Graduate Student Industrial Fellowship project is to develop accurate reduced order models for analysis and prediction of both quasi-steady and dynamic loads acting on aircraft.  A fundamental theoretical basis for integration of a rigid aircraft simulation that includes a nonlinear aerodynamic database with a flexible aircraft representation that includes an unsteady aerodynamic database is to be developed. Appropriate mathematical techniques will be identified to allow development of a new time domain reduced order 'integrated aeroelastic model'.  Next, techniques based on this integrated model will be developed to predict both quasi-steady and dynamic loads for aircraft design. The equations used to predict flight paths of an aircraft, and the loads acting on the aircraft, are inherently nonlinear and complex.  Accurate simplification of these equations, incorporating aeroelastic effects, is important to facilitate the development of design tools for predicting flight paths and dynamic loads early in the design cycle for advanced airplanes. \r\n\t\r\nThe industrial partner for this project, Boeing, Inc., St. Louis, will provide mentoring at the industry end for the graduate student supported, including access to the structural and aeroelastic models and analytical tools presently used by them.   The techniques developed will be useful to develop reliable integrated aircraft simulators, which would shorten the design and development cycle for advanced airplanes.\r\n\r\n",
