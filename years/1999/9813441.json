OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigators propose to continue an atmospheric sampling program that was initiated in winter \r\n1997-98 with a pilot program at 10,600 feet altitude at the summit of the Greenland Ice Cap. The 1997-98 pilot project was the first attempt to measure atmospheric chemistry during the winter season and the first attempt by NSF to support a science team at the Summit station during winter conditions.  The scientific success of the pilot project and the logistics lessons learned prove that the proposed continuation of a winterover sampling program is a viable method for determining the variables that control the transfer of the atmospheric chemistry into the ice core record. The calibration of the atmospheric chemical record with the snowfall record will be used to determine how the atmospheric record is transferred into the ice record.  The ultimate goal is to interpret the past atmospheric chemistry using samples of the Greenland Ice Sheet Two (GISP2) project ice core that was collected previously at the site. The100,000 year annual record of the GISP2 ice core will provide the opportunity to examine the record of atmospheric changes from both natural and anthropogenic causes.\r\n",
