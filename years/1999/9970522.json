 "awd_abstract_narration": "In free boundary problems one seeks to determine a solution of PDE system in \r\na domain, as well as the boundary of the domain itself; naturally a \r\nsupplementary condition is imposed which connects the unknown boundary (the \r\n\"free boundary\") to the unknown solution.  This condition arises from the \r\nphysical laws which underlie the model.  Some general theories developed as \r\nresearchers tried to resolve special free boundary problems.  For instance, \r\nthe theory of variational inequalities evolved from the study of contact \r\nproblems in elasticity and from solidification problems.  The present project \r\nis ongoing work, primarily in two areas:  (1) Propagation of cracks, where the \r\nPDE is a solution of the biharmonic equation, with zero traction along the \r\ncrack, and the crack'9s tip propagate in time in accordance with mode I or \r\nmode II of fracture mechanic laws; (2) A system of two reaction-diffusion \r\nequations for the pressure of tumor cells and nutrient concentration within \r\nan evolving tumor, with a conservation law at the boundary.  The objective is \r\nto derive existence, uniqueness, stability and qualitative properties.  \r\nThese are new types of free boundary problems not covered by present theories.\r\n\r\nThe results of the first project will lead to better understanding of how \r\ncracks propagate in elastic material, a problem which is becoming increasingly \r\nimportant in the wiring of circuit boards and in aging airplane panels, for \r\nexample.  The second project deals with simple tumor models that mathematical \r\nbiologists have developed in recent years.  Our research will provide some \r\nunderstanding of how the size and shape of the tumor will evolve in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
