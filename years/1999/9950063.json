 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAquaculture is the fastest growing segment of the agriculture industry in the United States. In the southeastern US, production of catfish contributes nearly $3.5 billion to each of the four major production states (Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi). Advances in aquaculture technologies during the last decade have further increased the productive capabilities of the US. Although aquaculture curricula exist, few secondary or two-year educational programs introduce students to the field of aquaculture and the potential career opportunities that exist within this industry. Of the existing programs, few provide students with those hands-on, laboratory experiences necessary to meet industry standards for skilled technicians.  One goal of this project is to develop an educational partnership between Gadsden State Community College (GSCC) and three Alabama secondary schools in order to provide experiences in aquaculture sciences for high-potential students. Faculty from GSCC and Auburn University are providing technical expertise to secondary schools so they may set up and maintain demonstration aquaculture systems--mini-fish farms--in the schools.  GSCC is also developing a partnership with Auburn University and local industry in Alabama to offer educational experiences in aquaculture sciences for secondary and two-year school students and secondary teachers. This partnership is introducing technical curricula in aquaculture technologies at secondary and two-year schools, (2) providing information to students about potential careers in aquaculture, and (3) giving students an opportunity to participate in the \"Intern and Learn\" program--which places students on working fish farms.  The project's program methods and materials will be disseminated to other secondary and two-year schools in Alabama that have recently been encouraged by the aquaculture industry to begin aquaculture programs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t",
