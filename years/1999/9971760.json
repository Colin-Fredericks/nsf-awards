Both analytical and computational techniques will be \r\nemployed. One approach is based on the \"anti-integrable\" (AI) limit, \r\nintroduced by Aubry in 1992. This principle yields analytical bounds for \r\nthe existence of chaotic dynamics, as well as an efficient numerical \r\ntechnique for continuation of families of periodic orbits. By extrapolation \r\none can also follow quasiperiodic and heteroclinic orbits as well. The \r\ndestruction of chaos is signaled by the first bifurcations in the system and \r\nthe creation of order by the bifurcations that create stable orbits and tori. A \r\nsecond project is to classify the heteroclinic orbits and their bifurcations \r\nfor a multi-dimensional version of the quadratic Henon map. \r\nClassification will be given through construction of \"primary intersection \r\nmanifolds,\" and by determining their homology on the \"fundamental \r\nannuli.\" A topological classification of structures in dynamical systems is \r\nimportant both in the analysis of data, and in the interpretation of \r\nnumerical experiments. It is well known that chaotic systems often have \r\nfractal invariant sets with various topological properties. These will be \r\nstudied in this proposal through the \"disconnectedness\" and \"discreteness\" \r\nof compact sets. The PI will develop techniques for computational \r\nhomology, yielding a definition for \"lacunarity\" and computational \r\nmethods for Betti numbers of resolution dependent approximations to \r\nthese sets.\r\n",
