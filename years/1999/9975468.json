These materials are used in a variety of applications, and a fundamental understanding of the relationship between their molecular structure and their resulting adhesive properties is highly desirable.  Model systems based on acrylic block copolymers will be used in order to make this connection.  These self-assembling systems have tunable structural features which enable their bulk mechanical and rheological properties to be carefully controlled.  Model polymeric substrates will be used in order to probe the factors which affect adhesion of these model systems to different surfaces.  The project includes synthesis of the model acrylic polymers, in addition to measurements of their mechanical and adhesive properties, utilizing techniques developed by the principal investigator at Northwestern University.  Experimental results will be coupled with a fracture mechanics analysis in order to develop general models applicable to the adhesion of soft materials.\r\n\r\nA variety of scientific and educational outcomes are expected as a result of this work.  The fundamental scientific goal is to develop a design strategy which can be used for the synthesis of improved adhesives.  While the research will center on the use of acrylic materials (which are commercially important as pressure sensitive adhesives), these ideas can be applied to a variety of adhesive formulations, including bioadhesive materials used for wound repair.  The research will be conducted primarily by Ph.D. students, with significant involvement by undergraduate students as well.  A continued collaboration with French scientists working on related problems will also play a role in this work.\r\n",
