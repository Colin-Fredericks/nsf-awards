One of these problems is concerned with the\r\ngeometric structure of the leaves of a lamination. Some natural\r\nquestions that the proposer intends to study are: what do the leaves\r\nof a lamination look like? how many different leaves\r\n(e.g. quasi-isometry classes) are there? what geometric invariants can\r\nbe (and cannot be) used to distinguish them? Still concerned with the\r\ngeometry of the leaves, there are questions about two dimensional\r\nlaminations and metric  uniformization of their leaves. Especially\r\ninteresting are those which have a Euclidean conformal structure,\r\nwhich are often encountered in problems of low dimensional topology\r\nand geometric group theory. Other part of this project falls in the\r\narea of rigidity of virtual subgroups of  semisimple groups and\r\nharmonic analysis on them. Research in this area has been concerned\r\nwith virtual subgroups which have an invariant measure. The proposer\r\nseeks to develop the study of harmonic measures, which are non\r\ninvariant in a reasonable way, and how they fit in the existing body\r\nof work on rigidity. Other part of the project concerns the study that\r\ncertain geometric properties of the leaves of a foliation have on its\r\ntransverse or dynamical structure and on the topological structure of\r\nthe ambient manifold.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research of the proposer is in the general area of qualitative\r\nstructure and behavior of dynamical systems. Dynamical systems are\r\nused to model processes in many areas, for example the evolution of\r\nliving organisms and their morphology, the weather or other physical\r\nor chemical processes. Other systems of interest come from processes\r\nwhich evolve from a finite amount of data according to some set of\r\nrules, either specified before hand or of a random nature. This could\r\nbe neural networks in the brain, systems of digital processors in a\r\ncomputer, branching processes (as in nuclear fission, evolution and\r\ngrowth of cells, etcetera). Even when appearing under different\r\ncircumstances, their dynamic behavior and structure follows similar\r\nlaws dictated by the individual elements and the nature of their\r\ninteraction. The purpose of the researcher is to study and classify,\r\nfrom a geometric/qualitative viewpoint, invariants of these systems\r\nrelating to their long time asymptotic behavior, their dependence on\r\nthe initial data, the generic properties of the possible states, and\r\ntheir global structure, all which can be used to understand the\r\nmechanisms underlying such processes.\r\n",
