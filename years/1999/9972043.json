In particular it is planned to consider the \r\ndetermination of the necessary and sufficient conditions under which such \r\nfunctionals will possess a minimizer. The project will also study \r\nhomogenization problems involving these functionals and representation \r\ntheorems for the associated set functions. Variational problems involving \r\nthese functionals with constraints on the minimizers will also be \r\nconsidered. The problems under study lead to very nonlinear equations. \r\nThe techniques to be used in this project will therefore be nonlinear \r\nanalysis involving dynamical systems, viscosity solutions for partial \r\ndifferential equations, variational inequalities, and nonsmooth analysis.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is optimization of systems where one seeks to \r\nminimize the worst that can occur. Examples where this is appropriate \r\ninclude the following important problems: (1) Determine the shape of a \r\nload bearing beam so as to minimize the maximum strains and stresses \r\nover the length of the beam. In the past one designs the beam minimizing \r\nthe total average energy, but cracks may still occur. (2) Find a \r\nchemotherapy regimen for treatment of cancer seeking to minimize the \r\nmaximum tumor load. This is much more realistic than minimizing the \r\naverage tumor load. (3) Minimize the maximum noise in a reflected radar \r\nbeam. (4) Determine a control which will steer a trajectory as close as \r\npossible to a target. (5) Find a portfolio that will maximize the minimum \r\nwealth over some time period. These are all examples of significant and \r\ninteresting problems in which the appropriate point of view is the worst \r\ncase scenario. They arise in medicine, engineering, economics, and many \r\nother fields. Furthermore, the analysis of the worst case gives the designer \r\na benchmark on which to judge all competing designs.\r\n",
