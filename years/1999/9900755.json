 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of unresolved paradoxes were left over from the development of quantum mechanics in the 1920's and 1930's.  While these have not prevented the application of quantum theory to a large number of different problems in physics and chemistry, they make it hard for students to learn the subject, and might suggest that there is some logical incoherence in quantum mechanics as currently understood.  These paradoxes, and the associated nonlocal influences which they are often thought to imply, will be studied using some relatively new ideas coming out of the consistent histories formulation of quantum theory, an extension of standard quantum mechanics which allows it to be applied in a consistent way to sequences of events involving three or more successive times.  The study will focus on whether these purported nonlocal influences are real, or result from failing to apply quantum ideas in a way which is consistent with the basic mathematics which underlies quantum theory.\r\n\tStandard quantum theory makes use of density matrices to provide a statistical description of a quantum system. However, the physical interpretation of density matrices is not very clear.  This will be studied by regarding density matrices as just one aspect of a more general formulation of quantum statistical mechanics made possible by the use of consistent history methods.  In this context, certain extensions to standard density matrix theory that are used in quantum optics and atomic physics will be taken into account.  Advances in this area will be of value for both quantum foundations and quantum information theory.\r\n\tQuantum information theory is concerned with developing the conceptual and mathematical tools needed when using quantum effects for purposes of transmitting quantum states, quantum cryptography, and quantum computation.  Mathematical methods which play a central role in many topics in quantum information theory will be studied by looking at simple examples, and looking for properties which can be shown to hold in more general situations.  In addition, the problem of improving efficiency in quantum communication and quantum computers will be addressed using ideas based upon consistent histories.\r\n",
