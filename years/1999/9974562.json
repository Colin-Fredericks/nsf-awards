 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Nathan S. Lewis and his coworkers at the California Institute of Technology are investigating the surface chemistry of crystalline silicon surfaces.  The emphasis in this work is on the wet chemical processing of silicon surfaces, with the goal of developing methods to suppress oxidation of silicon in the electrochemical environment, to control the formation of dielectric and barrier layers on the silicon surface, and to attach redox active groups to the surface in controlled geometries.  Work is also underway to explore the attachment and formation of patterned layers of nanoscale materials to the modified silicon surface.  The work builds on halogenation/alkylation chemistry developed in the Principal Investigator's laboratory and will impact the use of silicon in solar cell applications, the basic understanding of electron transfer at interfaces, and the development of silicon based-sensor devices.  Applications of this work to controlled electroplating and electrocatalysis are also expected. \r\n\r\nThe control of the surface chemistry of crystalline silicon surfaces is the goal of this research project supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Wet chemical processing methods based on halogenation and subsequent alkylation of the silicon surface are used to passivate and modify the silicon surface, and to controllably deposit nanometer sized particles on the silicon surface.  This work will impact broad areas of surface and analytical chemistry, including the development of sensor devices, the conversion of solar energy, and the metallic coating of semiconductor surfaces. \r\n\r\n",
