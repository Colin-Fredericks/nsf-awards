 "awd_abstract_narration": "The excitement of working with state-of-the-art equipment is a very important factor in attracting students to scientific careers.  Providing that excitement and thereby attracting students to science is the primary goal of this project. Prior to this project, students in our undergraduate laboratories had no access to NMR spectroscopy. The goal of this project is to provide spectrometer to our undergraduate students via a modern two-channel 300 MHz NMR spectrometer with a flow cell probe and sample handler. The laboratory curriculum is invigorated from a newly implemented series of experiments.  Undergraduate students in the organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry laboratories have access to NMR spectra of all of their synthesized compounds. Access is provided for physical chemistry laboratory projects and to honors research students.  Instruction in the acquisition of their own NMR spectra is provided to students of a newly implemented advanced organic chemistry laboratory and honors individual research. Summative and formative evaluations of this project are being conducted in consultation with the Coordinator of Assessment and Evaluation in the FSU Educational Services Program. The integration of this technology into our laboratory instruction significantly enhances the scientific educational experience of ~300 students each year, 21% of whom are minorities and 55% of whom are women.  This project adapts gains from the \"Integrated Chemical Instruction and Computation: Local and Distance Learning Evaluation\" project (NSF DUE 9751465).  The results of this curriculum adaptation and implementation are planned for dissemination via the FSU Department of Chemistry Undergraduate Program WWW page and to national NMR and Chemical Educational conferences.",
