 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops and empirically tests dynamic programming models of inventory investment and price determination by durable commodity intermediaries. These firms acquire bulk quantities of durable commodities such as steel, lumber, or coal from producers and subsequently sell their inventories to customers at a markup. The investigators have established a working relationship with one such intermediary, a U.S. steel supplier, which has provided them with detailed daily data on purchases, sales, and inventory holdings for over 2,000 products since June, 1997 with monthly updates on an on-going basis.  A major component of the research is micro-oriented, focusing on developing computational and econometric methods to determine whether the firm's behavior can be accurately approximated as an optimal trading strategy from the solution to a dynamic programming problem. Since the data provide identities of each of the intermediary's customers and the prices and quantities they purchased, the investigators can study whether dynamic models of optimal price discrimination can explain significant variations in prices charged to different customers. The project develops new econometric procedures for correcting the problem of dynamic selectivity bias resulting from endogenous sampling of the prices at which the intermediary acquires new inventories.  The research also draws macro-level implications by aggregating the micro-level models to develop a market-level (disequilibrium) model of price determination. The investigators analyze the impact of macro shocks and cyclical fluctuations in interest rates on the behavior of these markets to provide new insights into the role of inventories as propagating or stabilizing mechanisms in business cycles.  Finally, this research program extends the state of the art on numerical methods for continuous dynamic programming problems such as the inventory problem by comparing discrete approximation methods such as uniform discretization, quadrature-based methods, and random and low-discrepancy multi-grid methods to continuous approximation methods based on polynomial and neural network approximations to the value function and decision rule. The investigators also evaluate Euler equation methods (e.g. parameterized expectations), and methods from the AI/learning literature such as \"Q-learning\" and neuro-dynamic programming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
