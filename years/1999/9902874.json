 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action provides for the continuation of the lease of land for part of the staging base at Christchurch, New Zealand for the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP).  The lease was established on August 3, 1988 between the Christchurch International Airport Limited (CIAL) and the United States of America, and was initially scheduled to expire on September 30, 1991.  Through a series of amendments, the lease was extended to September 30, 1998.  The U.S. Navy (Commander, Pacific Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command) was assigned responsibility for the lease for the United States  On April 1, 1998, the fourth amendment to the lease assigned responsibility for the United States from the Navy to the National Science Foundation.  \r\n\r\nThis lease is for land only on which sits buildings and property owned by the National Science Foundation.  While the Navy was responsible for the lease, NSF reimbursed the Navy for the lease cost, since the land was being used for the sole purpose of supporting the USAP.  NSF is negotiating to have the lease transferred from NSF to its support contract, Antarctic Support Associates (ASA).  Negotiations were not completed September 30, 1998.  CIAL has agreed to extend the current lease until negotiations are complete.  NSF has agree to make quarterly payments on the lease cost directly to CIAL until negotiations can be completed and a new lease between ASA and CIAL is executed.\r\n\r\nFirst quarter costs for FY-1999 are $30,937 USD.  Based on my analysis of the lease negotiations and the recommendation of the NSF contracts office, I recommend this funding award. \r\n",
