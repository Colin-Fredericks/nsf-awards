 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University requests funds from the National Science Foundation's CCLIA&I program for focused investment for instrumentation in the area of haptic human computer interaction for undergraduates in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. Haptics in computer science and engineering is a term used to describe the ability to interact with virtual worlds using the sense of touch. The concept of including the sense of touch along with sight and sound in the human-computer interface is not new. Research in haptics or force-feedback has been active since the 1960's. What is new is that haptic functionality has just recently moved out of the research labs and onto the desktop, on its journey into the mainstream of computer usage. Ultimately, the result will be a fundamental and profound enhancement of the human-computer interface that will allow people to better utilize the power of the computer for a broader array of applications. Enabling haptic capability will produce a revolutionary change in the way humans interact with computers, opening up new avenues of digital creativity in a vast array of simulation applications.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary objectives of this project is to integrate haptics into an undergraduate Computer Science curriculum with advanced projects in courses such as CS425 Human Computer Interaction, CS375 Graphics and Virtual Reality, and CS498 Independent Research. This will expose undergraduate students in Computer Science and Computer Engineering to the software techniques of programming haptic devices for human computer interaction applications. Students will be experimenting with a programmable, three-dimensional sense of touch that will allow the user to feel textures and shapes of virtual objects, modulate objects and even deform objects. This project will boost student interest in pursuing more scholarly activities such as going on to graduate school, and seeking employment in scientific, research oriented institutions. This instrumentation and the incorporation of haptics into undergraduate education may be of interest to other institutions, and may lead to the development of new experiments and approaches in laboratory instruction in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. This project may also provide a springboard for collaborative student projects between Computer Science and Physics majors giving them opportunities to engage in haptic simulation development at the undergraduate level.\r\n",
