 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project analyzes how the state constructs gendered citizenship as it interprets the needs of single mothers. The welfare office is one of the locations in which citizens meet the state face-to-face. Using the concept of \"needs interpretation\" we show how the state, represented by those who implement policy, is implicated in the construction of gendered needs associated with women's mothering, work, and care, and how these gendered needs constructions form the basis for female citizenship. Recent policy changes in the Netherlands and the United States offer the opportunity to analyze how welfare states construct the needs of one group of women, single mothers. In general, the outcome of the interaction between caseworkers and clients is determined by the levels of knowledge, the amount of discretion, and the kinds of ideologies held by both caseworkers and clients. At the same time, differences in welfare state regimes and in women's labor force participation rates will also affect caseworkers' efforts to channel single mothers into the labor force. In addition, women's own perceptions of their needs affect their interactions with the state as represented by their caseworkers. To understand these processes, client-caseworker interactions will be observed and in-depth interviews conducted with both clients and caseworkers in each country. This will show whether policies that appear to approach the problems of single mothers with very similar solutions have different results in the type of gendered citizenship ultimately constructed. These observations and interviews will focus on how certain needs associated with mothering, work, and care become salient while others are ignored and how in this process new bases of single mothers' citizenship rights are articulated.",
