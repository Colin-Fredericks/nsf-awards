 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein tyrosine kinases and their partner phosphatases are key regulatory elements of many cell signaling pathways that control such basic and essential functions as cell division, cell-cell communication, and cell differentiation.  Control within these pathways is also critical in such important processes as activation and inhibition of lymphocytes in immune responses, integration of developmental pathways involving interacting cell types, and prevention of neoplastic cell growth.  This conference is a continuation of an annual series of conferences on these topics which began in 1995.  The aims of this year's meeting are (1) to examine the structure, function and regulation of these kinases and phosphatases as related to their specific regulatory context, (2) to provide overviews of specific areas in which recent significant advances have been made, including studies on the cross-talk with phosholipid-dependent signaling and new genetic approaches, and (3) to encourage the development of young scientists, including women and minorities, by their inclusion in the program.  The organization of the meeting consists of two invited keynote addresses followed by topical sessions in which all presentations will be chosen from the abstracts of meeting participants.  There will be no predetermined list of speakers.  Session chairs will share the responsibility of choosing speakers with the meeting organizers and will give overviews of the current status of each field.  All participants will have an opportunity to present findings in poster sessions.  Meeting abstracts will be published by Cold Spring Harbor Press for the general scientific community.  The organizers encourage the participation of students, young investigators, women, and under-represented minorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
