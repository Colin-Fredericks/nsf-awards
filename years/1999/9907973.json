 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Moche, who controlled much of Peru's northern coast from AD 200-600, were on eof the first societies in South America to develop state level social organization. Although Moch civilization has been well-studied archaeologically, much less is known about the rise and collapse of societies that preceded the Moche in this region, and how these earlier transformations influenced the process of state formation. Most importantly, little is known about how changing socail conditions, particularly increasing socail stratification, affected the health and material well-being of theinhabitants of this region. The proposed research seeks to address these issues with analysis of a collection of prehistoric burials from Cerro Oreja, a large site located in the Moche Valley with a 1,500 tear history of occupation. As Cerro Oreja was the paramount center in the valley during the critical period immediately preceding Moche state formation and expansion, the site provides an excellent vantage point from which to observe cultural change.The skeletal sample from Cerro Oreja has great potential as a source of information on prehistoric health and social status, due to its large size, quality of contextual information and degree of chronological and spatial control. Bioarchaeological methods will be used to assess how the changing socio-political organization of this population influenced the relationship between social status and health. The health status of individuals classified as elites and commoners will be compared to evaluate the proposition that high status individuals are better buffered against the effects of nutritional stress, disease, and chronic conditions associated with strenuous physical activities. Changes in the health status of people of different social groups will be analyzed through examination of material form three cultural phases that culminated in hte formation of the Moche state. This research will produce data useful for evaluating models generated by archaeological research to explain the evolution of the state on the Moche Valley. The data obtained will also increase our knowledge of disease processes in ancient societies from Andean South America. Finally, this investigation will contribute to our understanding of the interplay between health, class, and socio-economic organization.",
