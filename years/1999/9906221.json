There are few available lava records of younger (Plio-Pleistocene) field reversals from the African continent, and these lava flows have the potential of providing detailed records of those reversals.  The researchers will collect samples in the Gamarri section in the Central Afar Depression for their study of the paleointensity of the Reunion reversals.  They will also study the magnetostratigraphy of the Olduvai reversal recorded in the same section. The collaboration combines Dr. Herrero-Bervera's expertise in geomagnetism with Dr. Kidane's understanding of the volcanics of Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nResults are expected to provide detailed records of the reversals that define the Reunion and Olduvai normal polarity subchrons.  This new information will be a significant contribution to the current knowledge about paleointensity over geologic time.\r\n\r\nThe Division of International Programs and the Division of Earth Sciences are jointly providing funding for this project.\r\n",
