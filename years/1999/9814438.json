 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide variety of plants and animals use the length of day to synchronize their\r\ndevelopment and reproduction with the warm days of summer and to synchronize their entry into\r\nhibernation in advance of the cold days of winter.  At more northern latitudes, winter arrives\r\nearlier when days are longer than at more southern latitudes.  Consequently, northern organisms\r\nrespond to longer daylengths to switch from active development to hibernation in anticipation of\r\nthe forthcoming winter.  Many temperate plants and animals, including some of the most\r\nproblematic agricultural pests in the United States, originated from more tropical latitudes or\r\nmigrated north after the last ice age.  This migration required evolving the appropriate responses\r\nto daylength before the immigrants could thrive in their new northern habitats.  Thus, evolved\r\nresponses to daylength to cue the seasonal programming of development, reproduction, and\r\nhibernation represent one of the most pervasive and important adaptations of temperate\r\norganisms. \r\n     The question then remains as to how they do it.  What is the physiological basis for the\r\nmeasuring of daylength within and between geographically distant populations?  Are the\r\nphysiological processes that underlie genetic variation for day-length measuring within\r\npopulations the same processes that change over geographic distances; i.e., does understanding\r\ngenetic variation in the physiological clock within populations permit us to predict how these\r\npopulations might evolve in the future?  The PIs have pursued these questions in temperate\r\npopulations of a formerly tropical mosquito.  The PIs have found that the internal biological clock\r\n(circadian rhythm) plays a role in the day-length measuring process in southern populations; but,\r\nthe expression of the circadian clock declines with increasing latitudes so that northern\r\npopulations measure day length with essentially a physiological hourglass.  Yet, when unrelated\r\npopulations are crossed, their offspring show a reversion to the southern or ancestral switching\r\ndaylength.  This grant will help the PIs to determine whether reversion to the ancestral daylength also brings out the ancestral expression of the circadian clock. \r\n     In addition to contributing to our understanding of the genetic and physiological basis for\r\nadaptive evolution of biological time measurement, results of this study have implications for\r\nphysiological adaptation to changing environments in general.  If vestigial physiological\r\ncapabilities reside covertly within populations, physiological adaptation to environmental change\r\nmay proceed far more rapidly than would be predicted from present-day, overt genetic variation\r\nfor that trait in a population.  If these covert capabilities are relics from ancestral genes lying\r\nlatent in extant populations,  then response to selection may proceed faster towards ancestral than\r\ntowards new capabilities.  Hence, predicting the rate of evolution in response to environmental\r\nchange such as global warming may depend critically upon understanding the historical role of\r\nmasked or covert genes in physiological adaptation.\r\n\r\n",
