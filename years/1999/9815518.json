 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well established that a small concentration of polymeric material in a liquid can result in a large reduction of the wall shear stress in a turbulent flow.   This proposal addresses a related but less well established topical area:  that of transition from laminar to turbulent flow states.  The proposer has identified a distinctive flow condition that will permit the effects of the polymer additives to be isolated.  This flow state is termed a Nagata flow.  The following segment, from the authors text, concisely states the central features of the proposed work.\r\n\r\n\tWe believe that the discovery of the Nagata flows provides an important opportunity to study the physics of the onset of turbulence, and that examining how these flows are affected by viscoelasticity will shed light on the fundamental nature of drag reduction and more generally the nonlinear fluid dynamics of polymer solutions.  Therefore, the proposed work will extend the bifurcation analysis of theNagata flows to models of polymer solutions, considering both the large scale computation of the \"exact\" viscoelastic Nagata flows, as well as low-order models constructed to attempt to contain the dominant physics.  An important unresolved question in drag reduction is the relative importance of extensional viscosity, anisotropy of viscosity and fluid elasticity.  We will examine fluid models that incorporate these three effects separately, observing how the type of fluid model used modifies the Nagata flows and the bifurcation sequence that leads to them.\r\n",
