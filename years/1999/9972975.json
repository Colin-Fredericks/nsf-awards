 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are aspects of development that cannot be understood solely by the study of the temporal progression of differential gene activity and the sequential effects of one gene's product on the next gene in a cascade.  The emergence of spatial pattern in the embryo must, at some point, arise from the asymmetric influence of an external agent.  The polarizing influences may be the asymmetrical location of accessory cells in the ovary, such as the nurse cells of the insect follicle.  The result of external asymmetries is the non-random distribution of proteins and mRNA within the egg so that these molecules may be differentially distributed to the daughter cells at first division.  This motif is replayed at later stages of development.\r\n\tThe details of the primary polarization events described above are difficult to study. The cells involved are often small or inaccessible.  It may not be possible to control the external gradients that influence polarity, even it the identity of the important agents are known.  The eggs of the brown algae, Fucus and Pelvetia, have long been used as a model system for these studies, and recent work has led to a remarkable convergence of mechanisms between the algal eggs and other developmental systems.  The initially apolar zygotes convert a light gradient into a developmental gradient over a period of hours, eventually germinating at one locus to express the rhizoid-thallus axis. First cell division is perpendicular to this axis with the result that two cells with different fates are formed. Recent studies in this laboratory have demonstrated the formation of light-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients that proceed germination by hours, with high Ca2+ on the future rhizoidal side.  There is also an obligatory increase in cGMP and there is evidence that the photoreceptor may be an opsin-like protein.  \r\n\tThe proposed research aims to exploit the ability to detect cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients to rigorously test the hypothesis that the gradient directs the formation of an axis.  For example, does a gradient form in the predicted way when the cells are polarized by external gradients other than light?  Does the gradient re-form in the expected way when an imposed polarity is reversed by reversing the light direction?  Is the source of the Ca2+ extracellular or is some released from intracellular stores? \r\n\tAequorin will be used as a Ca2+ sensor to give improved temporal resolution.  The method used in the experiments described above has poor temporal resolution.  Preliminary results with aequorin indicate that important details of process are thus missed.  A new method has been devised to permit the measurement of aequorin light with excellent temporal resolution and a degree of spatial resolution.\r\n\tSelf-referencing ion specific electrodes will be used to determine the localized net influx and efflux of ions  (especially Ca2+, but also H+ and K+) during the polarization process.  The details of how Ca2+ fluxes change with respect to the formation of a Ca2+ gradient may make it possible to distinguish among alternate possibilities of how light leads to formation of gradients.\r\n\tThe hypothesis that the photoreceptor is an opsin-like protein will be challenged.  The ability of retinal to restore photosensitivity to blinded cells will be tested.  Extracted membrane proteins will be screened with a variety of anti-opsin antibodies.  Radioactive retinal will be employed in an effort to label the putative opsin.  A Fucus cDNA library will be screened with oligonucleotides designed from conserved regions of opsins in an effort to demonstrate the existence of an opsin gene via PCR.\r\n\t\r\n",
