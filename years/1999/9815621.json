TE transpositions are a major source of mutation in higher eukaryotes including humans. Little is known, however, of how transpositional activity is regulated.  \r\n\r\nDr. Nuzhdin will infer the relative contribution of natural selection and host-TE co-evolution in maintaining a stable number of TE copies in a host genome. TE activity is normally restricted by the host; however, many genomes have evidence of sudden TE explosions.  \r\n\r\nDr. Nuzhdin will first test the hypothesis that TE expression is deleterious. This hypothesis will be supported if natural selection acts more strongly against expressing TEs than against those lacking promoters. The second specific aim is to infer what causes TE explosions in model experimental Drosophila populations.  For this, the host genes responsible for the restriction of copia transposition will be identified, and their variants permitting transpositions will be molecularly characterized. \r\n\r\nResults will shed light on the factors determining TE activity, and their maintenance and spread in natural populations. This knowledge will help to prevent possible future instances of TE explosions, which are likely in species escaping natural selection in captivity, as well as in humans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
