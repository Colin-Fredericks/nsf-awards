 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe project studies the evolving relationship between the Russian minority and the national majority (or titular) communities of three Soviet successor states:  Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Latvia.  Based on four months of field work in each state, the project's primary objective is to provide plausible answers to the following research questions.  First, what explains the surprisingly peaceful character of the Russian-titular relationship in each of these states?  Second, what explains the variation in the degree to which Russians in each state support attempts by titular elites to create their own newly independent state?  Specifically, why are Russian-Latvian relations slightly more than contentioius than Russian-Kazakh relations, and why are both of these relationships far more contentious than Russian-Kyrgyz relations?  Field research explores the hypothesis that how titular elites materially and symbolically portary their desires for national self-assertion, and the appropriate role of the Russian minority in this context, shapes the collective Russian response to attempts by titular elites to build their own newly independent state.\r\n\tThree research methods are applied in each state.  First, policy initiatives and rhetoric of the titular elite are analyzed in order to explore how this elite communicates with the Russian minority and how it institutionalizes the status of this group.  Second, data on the behavior of the Russian minority, both cooperative and antagonistic, are analyzed to explore the Russian community's response to the titular community, its policies, and its rhetoric.  Third, the Russian viewpoint, in terms of the choices which the Russian community defines as realistic in reaction to decisions made by titular elites, is analyzed.  Interviews with key representatives of the Russian community provide data on the Russian viewpoint.  This Russian perception sheds light on how titular policies and rhetoric affect the behavior of the Russian minority.\r\n\tBecause the project is based on cross-regional work in post-communist Europe (Latvia) and Eurasia (Kyrgyzstan, Kazahkstan), it explores post-communist development in general.  Specifically, the project addresses the broad and theoretically challenging question of the conditions under  which multiethnic states in any region of the world can weaken the potential for, or avert, violent ethnic conflict.  In addition, because it examines the development of ethnic relations in Soviet successor states, the project provides insight into the degree of political stability characterizing each state, which is increasingly relevent in potentially divisive multiethnic states of the post-Cold War era.   \r\n",
