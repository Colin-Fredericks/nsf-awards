 "awd_abstract_narration": "Use of a high-field NMR instrument is giving our students access to current technology in NMR instrumentation and is better preparing students to be professional chemists because all of the courses involve projects that simulate industrial group work.  Standard NMR experiments used at other institutions as well as experiments drawn from the NMR research literature are being adapted to the group work setting.  Students are exposed to all aspects of NMR from an introduction to basic spectral use at the first-year level, routine instrument use at the Organic level (proton and carbon), quantitative calculations, 2-dimensional NMR, and splitting patterns at the Instrumental/Physical level, and multinuclear NMR and unknown characterization with several analytical techniques at the Advanced Topics level.  Approximately 250 students per year majoring in chemistry, natural science, biology, medical technology, pre-professional programs, and secondary education-science emphasis are using the instrument. Two cross course projects using research-based NMR analysis involve 180 students directly each year.  In addition, the NMR is used in a range of undergraduate research projects.  Exposure of local high school teachers and students occurs through planned programs in the Chemical Educators Association and Chemathon. Other junior college and four-year college faculty receive exposure at the Small College Conference.",
