 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graphical user interfaces have become commonplace and are now much more easily built. Languages like Java are available to build user interfaces using the now familiar object oriented, event-driven programming model. Curricula for human-computer interface courses have been proposed by (Greenberg, 1996), NSF (Strong, 1994), ACM (Hewett, 1992), and Carnegie-Mellon University (Perlman, 1989). This project adapts and implements these curricular recommendations into a practical undergraduate graphical user interface course targeted at schools with Carnegie classification of Master's and Baccalaureate.\r\n\r\nThe course is based on the curricula recommendations cited above.  Students in the course implement GUIs following the design principles derived from HCI research as well as the specific guidelines literature that is also available. Students build interface prototypes at various degrees of fidelity. Designing and executing usability studies with participants from the proposed user population are also part of the course.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect of the course is its interdisciplinary nature. Faculty from graphic design and technical writing are participants in the course. This aspect of the course is meant to show computer science students that expertise from other disciplines is necessary in the design of graphical user interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe materials from the course have potential to be widely disseminated. The long-term goal of this project is increasing the number of such courses taught at the target institutions by sharing course materials and experience in a variety of settings. The short-term goal is bringing this material to our students.\r\n\r\n",
