 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"true\" violets, belonging to the genus Viola, comprise a large and very\r\ndiverse group of plants that is found worldwide but is especially rich in\r\nthe mountain regions of the Latin American tropics.  Like many other\r\ntropical plant groups, Latin American representatives have received little\r\nserious scientific attention.  Studies are desperately needed to understand\r\nspecies diversity there, clarify distinctions of species and figure out\r\nrelationships among them, and eventually to illuminate evolutionary\r\nprocesses of diversification.  Recent molecular studies of Latin American\r\nand other violet groups worldwide by the Principal Investigator demonstrate\r\nthat Latin American violets are the oldest and most primitive of all.\r\nThus, investigations on these violets will reveal important clues regarding\r\nthe origins of violets around the world, their evolution, global migration\r\nand remarkable success.  One of the two largest violet groups in Latin\r\nAmerica, section Leptidium, is the focus of the funded research.\r\n\r\nField expeditions to Colombia and Venezuela, Peru and Bolivia, and\r\nsoutheastern Brazil, will be made to study populations of all species of\r\nsect. Leptidium in the field and to bring back flowering and fruiting\r\nmaterials for intensive laboratory studies.  Details of flowers, leaves,\r\ncapsules and seeds will be compared among field-sampled populations, and\r\nagainst thousands of museum collections on loan from other botanical\r\ninstitutions, to determine recognizable species.  A composite\r\nrepresentative from each of several populations of each species will be\r\nbrought back from the field expeditions for molecular investigations.  Two\r\ntypes of molecular data, DNA sequences from the nuclear Internal\r\nTranscribed Spacer region, and highly variable Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat\r\nmarkers, will be generated from the population samples to interpret\r\nrelationships between populations and species in section Leptidium.\r\nChromosome numbers taken from flowers of species in the group, and physical\r\ncharacteristics of species, will be compared with other groups of violets\r\naround the world, in order to interpret evolutionary patterns in the \"true\"\r\nviolets as a whole.  A traditional taxonomic treatment will be completed\r\nfor species in section Leptidium, to serve botanists and naturalists who\r\nencounter these violets in Latin America.\r\n\r\n",
