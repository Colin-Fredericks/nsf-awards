 "awd_abstract_narration": "CCR-9902796\r\nHemami\r\n\r\nThe increase in image transmission, currently over the internet and in the future via wireless personal-communication-services, poses new problems with respect to digital image compression.  High-quality images can be nearly instantaneously downloaded over a communications link with high bandwidth.  However, as bandwidth decreases, the download time increases dramatically.  At some point, the user may decide whether to continue or to stop the transmission based on the image information available, rather than waiting for the entire high-quality image.  If the transmission is stopped at any point, the\r\nuser should ideally have an image of the highest possible visual quality for that amount of data.  Generation of such images requires an understanding of the human visual system (HVS), and specifically how the HVS perceives compression artifacts in low-quality images. However, HVS research to date has focussed only on understanding how the HVS perceives artifacts in high-quality images.  The goal of this research is to quantify the perception of compression artifacts in wavelet-coded images with visible artifacts.  The resulting\r\nalgorithms will allow image recognition, object identification, and data extraction at lower bit rates than algorithms known to date, and hence imaging tasks will require that less data be transmitted or downloaded.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will experimentally quantify human sensitivity to supra-threshold compression artifacts in wavelet-compressed images. Because sensitivity to visible artifacts is under evaluation, a top-down test in which actual images are distorted is employed, rather than the traditional bottom-up test which measures sensitivity to individual basis functions.  Uniform quantization noise is added to individual subbands and observers identify the step sizes that produce noticeable differences.  Fifteen images selected for their specific visual characteristics and over 150 subjects will provide a data set large enough to make general characterizations rather than producing image- and observer-specific results.  The effects of granular and\r\noverload distortion will be separately characterized, and these experimental results will be incorporated into quantization strategies and compression algorithms, both for traditional and embedded wavelet coders.\r\n\r\n",
