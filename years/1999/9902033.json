This is an essential part of the NSF planning process and the information gathered and published will be extremely helpful to NSF and the R&E community at large. The Advanced Network Infrastructure program has a number of important constituent groups that should be consulted as a part of a post-vBNS planning activity. These groups include at least the following sectors: university CIOs and administrators, the general science and university research community, the computer and networking science research community, industry, and those involved with the Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (PACI). This AAAS proposal will allow us to cover the general science and university research community.\r\n",
