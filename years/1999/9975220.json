 "awd_abstract_narration": "ACT-R is a theory that tries to model the microstructure of human cognition in time increments of less than a second.  According to the ACT-R theory, during each step of cognition some information is retrieved from the environment or memory in response to a goal and this information is used to transform the goal.   The research will apply the theory to three domains.  Part of the methodology in this research will be to monitor and interpret eye movements to get information about the temporal dynamics of problem solving.   The first domain of study will be equation solving, a task of immediate educational significance.  The research addresses the question of how fluency in retrieval of arithmetic facts and basic algebraic transformations determines fluency in an advanced mathematical skill.  It will measure the duration of eye fixations in reading equations and study how these reflect retrieval processes.  These studies will lay the foundation for using eye movements to inform computer-based instruction.  The second domain, planning in the Tower of Hanoi laboratory task, is concerned with how planning is guided in complex problem solving.  The research tests basic assumptions in the theory about how goals are remembered to organize moment-by-moment problem solving.  The timing of individual steps in the solution will be measured and we will look at those that are associated with retrieval of goals.  The third domain, research on the psychological refractory period, is concerned with how perception, cognition, and action are intertwined to determine the flow of behavior.  The experiments look at when and how doing one task interferes with doing a second task.  The ACT-R theory claims that central cognition can only do one thing at a time but that central cognition can run in parallel with perceptual and motor processes.  Understanding the timing dependencies in such tasks is important for identifying the critical factors in use of artifacts like computer applications.    The research and theory will be extended to studies of how people coordinate eye movements and mouse movements while using a computer.",
