 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860239\r\n     This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research  Phase I project from Structured Materials Industries Inc., will  show proof-of-principle that the firm  can make transparent Diodes (p-type ZnO by, PE-MOCVD). Japanese researchres recently announced that they had succeeded in forming nitrogen doped room temperature p-type ZnO transparent and conductive thin films. Heretofore, transparent (wide bandgap) conductive oxides have almost exclusively been n-type. We have been highly successful in producing a variety of n-type highly conductive. highly luminescent and near epitaxial ZnO based films. If stable p-type transparent oxides can be repeatedly and economically reproduced then a great variety of new and enhanced ,wholly transparent device applications become available. Applications include: diodes, transistors, photovoltaics, sensors, p-type semiconductor contact layers, LEDs, OLEDs, among other devices. Based upon our capabilities, we are strongly positioned to investigate and develop p-type ZnO based films and devices. We  propose, in Phase I, to perform a rapid proof-of-principle p-type ZnO materials deposition and characterization study, and for the first time,  demonstrate a transparent oxide solid state p-n junction diode. The films and diodes will be characterized  and material and device theory will be developed. In Phase II. SMI will focus on refining materials and processes and produce commercializable transparent p-n diode devices.\r\n     Development of wide bandgap p-type transparent conductive oxides, combined with our existing n-type transparent conductive oxides could expand and generate several markets, including those of diode. transistors, wholly transparent displays. UV/blue emitters and detectors, and so on. Market leadership will result from materials capabilities.\r\n",
