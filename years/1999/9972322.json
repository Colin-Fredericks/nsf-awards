 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in desktop computing power and information technology are converging to make possible, superior pedagogy and promote active classroom learning. But individual efforts toward technological innovation in higher education have not fulfilled their promise, in part due to the reluctance of educators to employ \"canned\" learning aids. We contend that systemic change will follow only when instructors can readily craft their own materials that effectively exploit today's technology. The proposed project endeavors to provide educators with the tools needed to seamlessly integrate multimedia and computational elements into their classroom materials, and to do so with minimal investment of time and effort. The required tool set for Quantum Physics - dubbed QM Tools - is developed and distributed free of charge to the academic community. Prior to final release, the product is field tested extensively  nationwide, thereby ensuring maximum value of the tool set for its intended purpose and acceptability to a broad spectrum of college and university physics faculty. We also outline a non-proprietary strategy that uses QM Tools together with other stock hypermedia elements to assemble \"live\" documents that can be tailored to individual needs and preferences. Widespread adoption of the QM Tools concept would expose a vast majority of technically oriented students to a rich multimedia educational experience, with improved prospects for retaining the best and brightest among them, and even attracting traditionally under-represented groups to the study of science and engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
