Rate constants are determined in the temperature range of 300-1800 degrees K free from interference by other reactions that occur in flames by  using high-temperature fast-flow reactor (HTFFR) and high-temperature photochemistry (HTP) systems with products analyzed with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and mass spectrometry.  Past work concentrated on reactions of neutral atoms of toxic elements (chromium, tin, copper, cadmium, lead); this effort examines reactions of the neutral monochlorides and monoxides of those elements (and also mercury and barium) which are initial products of metal oxidation.  Also studied in this project are reactions of alkaline earth cations.\r\n\r\nMetals play an important role in many combustion processes as additives, impurities, or fuel.  Current information of the kinetics of these processes is very limited.  Increasingly, however, toxic metal species from burning of coal, diesel engines, and incinerators are recognized as serious air pollutants\r\n\r\n",
