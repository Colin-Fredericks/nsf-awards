These tomograms show features that are well correlated with topography and the geoid, but not in a manner expected from current models of oceanic mantle dynamics; these results thus have potentially profound implications for mantle dynamics.  The first priority of the research proposed here will be to collect a comprehensive data set for the central and western Pacific and to invert these data for a high-resolution 3D model of the region.  The data will include the travel times and dispersion characteristics of S-type body waves and reflections, upper-mantle guided waves, surface waves, and ScS reverberations.  This research will also improve on the inversion methodologies in several ways:  1)  by computing 3D sensitivity kernals, 2) by extending the inversion techniques to include amplitude variations, which will allow investigation of lateral variations in attenuation, and 3) by examining the effects of azimuthal anisotropy and its lateral heterogeneity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
