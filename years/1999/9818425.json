 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the main signals driving sex differences in behavior are androgens produced by the male tests.  Androgens promote the expression of various sex-specific behaviors by interacting directly with the nervous system where they bind to specialized receptor proteins in cells.  The nervous system is comprised of two main cell types, neurons and glia.  Neurons carry information and control behavior and glia have a more supportive role.  There is no doubt that androgens directly affect neurons, since these cell have androgen receptors (ARs).  However, recent evidence reveals that glia also have ARs, suggesting that androgens may also exert direct effects on gila. Dr. Jordan has found that Schwann cells, glia which ensheath axons in peripheral nerves, have ARs.  This novel finding has many implications.  For example, androgens keep neurons and synapses alive, even some neurons that lack ARs.  The effect of androgens on neuronal survival is likely mediated via neurotrophic substances.  Because Schwann cells make neurotrophic substances, androgens may act on ARs in Schwann cells to increase their productive of neurotrophic substances which in turn enhance neuronal and synaptic survival.  The experiments described in this proposal will further characterize the presence of ARs in peripheral nerve of adult male and female rodents with overall aim of understanding the role of ARs in regulating neural structure and function.  Immunocytochemistry, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and in situ hybridization will be used to identify and quantify which cells in peripheral nerve express the AR gene and protein.",
