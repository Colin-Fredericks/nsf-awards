 "awd_abstract_narration": "This a Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project from an interdisciplinary group composed of a materials scientist, a theoretical physicist and a synthetic chemist. The objective is to develop a versatile electron energy loss (EELS) spectroscopy technique using a transmission electron microscope to probe electronic response of a single carbon nanotube at the atomic scale and to explain this response based on a theoretical model of electron beam - nanotube interaction. The virtue of the approach is that it is non-contact, and may allow a fruitful alternative to the currently difficult and rate-limiting approach of attaching physical contacts to the carbon nanotubes in order to obtain transport properties. The project offers an excellent educational opportunity for a post-doctoral associate.\r\n%%%\r\nThis a Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project from an interdisciplinary group composed of a materials scientist, a theoretical physicist and a synthetic chemist. The group wishes to develop a non-contact method of characterizing the electronic transport properties of carbon nanostructures. If successful, the method could allow a fruitful alternative to the currently difficult and rate-limiting approach of attaching physical contacts to the carbon nanotubes in order to obtain transport properties. This would facilitate the functional design of nanoelectronics based on carbon nanostructures. The project offers an excellent educational opportunity for a post-doctoral associate.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
