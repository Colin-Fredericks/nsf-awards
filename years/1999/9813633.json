 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the question of the detailed structure of organic films.  Use of these films in a variety of electro- optical applications requires a detailed knowledge of the structural organization of the thin films, including the molecular orientation and the structural uniformity.  Professor Rowlen of the University of Colorado applies angle resolved photoacoustic spectroscopy to the investigation of the evloution of orientation within these self-assembled organic monolayers and multilayers.  The design and construction of a near field optical microscope using photoacoustic detection is a part of this research effort.  Application of these methods and scanning force microscopy to the determination of the roughness of thin film substrate materials and the effect of roughness on molecular orientation in the layers is also pursued. \r\n\r\nThe orientation and structural uniformity of organic thin films is important in the design and implementation of thin film electro-optic devices.  Methods to determine this information are underway in the laboratory of Professor Rowlen at the University of Colorado.  Photoacoustic spectroscopy, near field scanning optical microscopy, and scanning force microscopy are all used to evaluate the roughness of the film substrates and the molecular orientation of the overlying organic layers.  A detailed knowledge of the structure and orientation of these overlayers is then used in the construction of electro-optic devices. \r\n\r\n",
