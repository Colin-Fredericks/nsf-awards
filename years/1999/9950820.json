 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Geography and Geology has adapted a multi-dispersive x-ray fluorescence (MDXRF) spectrometer to teach laboratory-based courses. Adapting this spectrometer to courses in geosciences and social sciences has increased quality control analysis (Price and Ellis, 1996).  The application of geochemical techniques in modifying undergraduate earth science curriculum has provided students with the opportunity to explore relationships between physical earth processes and important human elements of geography, anthropology and archeology.   These geochemical techniques are designed and applied to investigatory problem-solving exercises in the students' own academic fields of interest in such areas as cultural diffusion, cultural integration, and cultural ecology.   The MDXRF also is used to enhance laboratory instruction for geology majors and enhances opportunities for student research requiring geochemical data.  We have implemented these learning techniques using geochemical instrumentation to introduce inquiry-based problem solving experiences. The students are able to develop an understanding about the affect of physical earth processes on human development and the necessity of scientific investigation in understanding physical earth-human relationships.\r\nThe MDX 1000 uses both energy dispersive (ED) and wavelength dispersive (WD) techniques combining classical WD and ED techniques with low-cost analyses that can be conducted on a variety of sample mediums, including liquids, glasses, granules, metals, papers and powders.  Students prepare samples and conduct XRF analyses of ore composition, refinement and metal extraction techniques; of bedrock and soil types; and conduct research in geochemistry, petrology, and soil science.",
