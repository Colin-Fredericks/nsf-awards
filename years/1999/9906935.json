 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the growth of global financial service industries has been phenomenal in recent decades, relatively little scholarly attention has been given to geographic dimensions of labor force participation and the impacts of global economic changes on people's everyday lives.  This doctoral dissertation research project will explore the ways in which increasing flows of global financial capital impact the lives of service workers in developing countries.  Critical questions to be answered through this project are:  What is the role of local forces in an era of increasing flows of global financial capital? and What is the relationship between the restructuring of occupations, changing identities, and forms of worker organization and resistance?  Fieldwork will be conducted over a nine-month period.  The first phase will focus on a set of in-depth interviews with senior representatives of the top four banks in Bogota concerning the impact of foreign capital flows on financial services labor markets in Colombia.  The second phase will examine restructuring from the perspective of labor organizers of the Central Unitaria de Trabajadores.  Interviews with workers in the third phase will elucidate the relationship between changes in the nature and spaces of work and how women perceive of themselves as political actors.  Participant observation of service work and union proceedings also will be used to illuminate the relations of financial service production and union negotiation.  This research will make theoretical and empirical contributions to understanding how global financial restructuring is intertwined with political processes that span scale ranging from the local to global.  By synthesizing approaches to labor relations from labor geography, critical development geography and critical feminist theory, the project will generate cross-disciplinary theoretical perspectives.  This research connects conceptualizations of economic production and political representation through a spatial analysis of changing terms of employment and forms of civic engagement, and it will explore how employers, unionists and workers interpret the scope of, and their role in, the political economy through their experience of work.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
