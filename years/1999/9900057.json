 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the development of a mathematical model and solution procedure for the assignment of workers to specific tasks in a system composed of manufacturing cells.  Given a specification of worker skill\r\nprofiles, machine groups, and part families, the model will determine a training plan, team assignment, and workload schedule for each worker to minimize total training cost while satisfying all skill requirements and\r\nachieving team synergy in each cell.  Several solution techniques will be developed and tested.  The techniques will span a range of computational and implementation complexity.  General purpose random search heuristics\r\nwill be compared to problem specific partial enumeration heuristics based on filtered-beam search and problem structure based decomposition strategies.  The solution procedures will be tested on problems developed with input from users of cells and consultants on team formation.  Procedures will be compared on the basis of computational efficiency and quality of solution.  Finally, the results will be used to extend existing models for cell design to incorporate the process of worker assignment and operational strategies.\r\n     The results of this research will lead to improved performance, both in terms of quality and cost, of team-based manufacturing systems.  The goal is to make optimal use of the existing pool of labor skills while\r\ndetermining the most effective manner for further developing and utilizing human resources.  Although the model is formulated and tested for the environment of cellular manufacturing, the model can be applied to general team formation and training problems and thus constitutes a basic contribution to human resource management as well as manufacturing.  In addition, by comparing enumeration based heuristics, random search heuristics, and decomposition strategies, the results will contribute to the general body of knowledge on solving hard mixed-integer problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
