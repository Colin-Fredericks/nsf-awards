(i) Under the first heading come two problems on parallel computations.  The first concerns a divide and conquer approach to the problem of computing the mean first passage matrix for Markov chains, work that was started in the case when the process is a random walk with an underlying cutpoint graph structure, e.g., a tree.  The second problem is to investigate the speed-up due to the addition of processors, when the number of blocks (natural partitions) is kept fixed, in a model of asynchronous iterations.  One factor here is the type of coefficient matrix to which the model is applied.  \r\n(ii) Under the second heading  comes a problem encountered when working on\r\nconvergence of infinite products of matrices.  It is known that in iterative methods for computing a solution to singular systems, e.g., in computing the stationary distribution for a Markov process, the magnitude of the subdominant eigenvalue determines the asymptotic rate of convergence.  We have noticed that for random stochastic matrices the subdominant eigenvalue seems to decay exactly as the square root of n.  We suggest investigating this behavior.  (iii) Here we suggest two problems on approximating the algebraic connectivity of a graph which is the second smallest eigenvalue of its Laplacian matrix.  Estimates of this quantity are used in various graph-based algorithms such as the spectral separator method.  In the first problem we suggest investigating bounds derived from the generalized group inverse of the Laplacian which seems to yield good lower bounds. In the second problem we propose studying the algebraic connectivity of random graphs on n vertices.  Throughout the proposal we give examples from the literature for the applications of the problems set forth.\r\n\r\nBecause many practical problems are very intricate, we need to build models to represent them and then develop a way of understanding and handling the models.  Such modeling frequently results in large arrays of numbers or, what is often associated with the arrays, a system with many equations and many unknowns.  The numbers in the array can be of a random nature if the model represents a physical situation (scientific, economic, social or statistical) in which there is some randomness involved. If the model represents a more deterministic physical situation, there will be definite numbers with some relations between them.  Once we have a model,  there may be many parameters and features which we need to measure and compute. This proposal suggests seven problems.  Two of the problems concern certain high-performance computing with these models.  The computations are to be performed in parallel so as to achieve speed-up of the computation and, if possible, a reduction in the number of computations.  Two examples of questions are: If a problem partitions naturally into a number of subproblems which are called blocks, and if we begin to increase beyond the number of blocks, the number of computers/processors applied to solve in parallel the entire problem, do we necessarily continue to increase the speed of calculations, or is a point of saturation reached after a while and what do we do then?  A common situation in which such a problem arises is in data-fitting, sometimes known as the least-squares problem.  Another problem for computation in parallel is in physical systems which have states with a probability of going from one state to another.  An example is various types of population concentrations such as urban, suburban, rural, etc. with a probability of moving from one type of region to another.  We may be interested in the distribution of the population in the different conurbations after a short term.  It turns out that such predictions  may be done in parallel under certain underlying assumptions.\r\n",
