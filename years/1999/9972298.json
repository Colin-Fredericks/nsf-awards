McDonald\r\n\r\nSuccessful L2-methods arise to address a wide variety of problems\r\nin a number of contexts (for example, mathematical physics,\r\ngeometry, and topology).  As this is the case, the methods\r\nthemselves are often strikingly different.  Nonetheless, it is\r\noften the case that these different methods can be used to\r\nprovide insight directed towards the same or similar problems.\r\nThe primary purpose of the workshop ``L2-methods in Geometry'' is\r\nto bring together leading figures in geometric analysis who have\r\ndeveloped different L2-methods for investigating related\r\ngeometric phenomena.  Topics which will be addressed at the\r\nworkshop will include: index theorems, traces and determinants of\r\npseudodifferential operators and their applications, spectral\r\ninvariants including analytic torsion and Novikov-Shubin\r\ninvariants, and Von Neumann algebra methods in (spectral)\r\ngeometry. The workshop will provide the young investigators with\r\na unique opportunity to interact with distinguished senior\r\ncolleagues who have developed a variety of approaches to\r\ngeometric problems and who will focus their collective attention\r\non a sharply defined collection of problems.\r\n\r\nAnalytic methods have contributed immensely to our collective\r\nunderstanding of many mathematical disciplines, as well as to our\r\nunderstanding of a number of fundamental topics in physics, some\r\nof which have found their way into important applications (for\r\nexample, various imaging techniques).  This workshop will bring\r\ntogether a distinguished international collection of scholars who\r\nhave made fundamental contributions to the field of geometric\r\nanalysis.  These contributions reflect a diverse collection of\r\nperspectives offerred as explanations for the same or similar\r\nphenomena.  Bringing these perspectives together will foster an\r\nexchange of ideas and collaboration on problems of deep interest\r\nto the mathematics community at large.  Such an environment will\r\nprovide many young investigators with a valuable oppportunity to\r\ncompare and contrast a variety of ideas and approaches, shaping\r\nthe direction in which they will move.\r\n",
