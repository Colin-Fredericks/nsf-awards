 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clarkson University in collaboration with 3 local school districts places 20 graduate students and 7 undergraduate students in local school districts to facilitate a \"Problem Based Learning\" (PBL) experience for the 7th and 8th grades with faculty collaboration from SUNY-Potsdam.  This project is providing a learning experience within a multidisciplinary atmosphere creating a direct link between basic science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) and their relevance to the solution of societal problems. Graduate and undergraduate fellows are using this pedagogical technique as a means to enhance the teaching of SMET in area schools while simultaneously increasing the interest in SMET subjects by the K-12 student population. The year-long curriculum is exposing 7th and 8th grade students to a wide variety of SMET concepts as they solve problems associated with environmental contamination that have direct impacts on their community.  Specific modules associated with the overall problem are being adapted to target high school and elementary school levels. The curriculum includes two initial projects, solid waste management at the school and the hazards of human exposure to environmental lead. The fellows are distributed across SMET disciplines at Clarkson. Through this process the fellows are also gaining a better understanding of problem solving strategies, and valuable experience in teaching and communication. Additional activities include:  1) seminars and a three-credit course to prepare the fellows; 2) workshops for teacher training in technology applications and PBL methodology; 3) partnership meetings for review of on-going projects and assessment of outcomes, and; 4) presentation of results to external review groups and educational societies. \r\n",
