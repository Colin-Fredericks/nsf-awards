 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Washington (UW) has a grant from the  National Science Foundation (NSF) to identify and institutionalize  successful practices employed by DO-IT (Disabilities,  Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology).  Implementation of  the Institutionalization of DO-IT project will increase the success  of people with disabilities in academic programs and careers in  science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET).       In 1992 the UW was awarded a three-year grant from NSF to  undertake activities to recruit and retain students with  disabilities in SMET.  The project was titled DO-IT.  In 1995  another three-year grant, called DO-IT Extension, was received from  NSF to continue and expand DO-IT activities.  Grants to extend  DO-IT efforts have also been received from the Telecommunications  Funding Partnership, the NEC Foundation of America, the Seattle  Foundation, the U.S. Department of Education, Honda, the White  House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National  Science and Technology Council, Washington Services for the Blind,  and U.S. West Communications.    DO-IT helps:       children and youth with disabilities learn strategies for       participation in SMET and how to access computers and the       Internet using adaptive technology.       high school students with disabilities transition to college       and careers in SMET.       SMET faculty become more receptive and capable of including       students with disabilities in their courses.       campus SMET programs become more accessible to individuals       with disabilities.       library staff and administrators understand how to make their       electronic resources accessible to patrons with disabilities.       camp directors learn how to incorporate Internet activities       into their curriculum and accommodate campers with       disabilities.       adult students and professionals with disabilities mentor       students with disabilities.       parents, service providers, and the pu blic become more aware       of the potential contributions and special needs of students       with disabilities in SMET fields.       identify factors leading to college completion and employment       in SMET.    Specific DO-IT activities have included:       summer study programs which allow high school students with       disabilities to explore SMET fields and develop college and       career transition skills and strategies.       a mentoring program that matches high school students with       disabilities with successful role models in SMET academic       programs and careers.       Internet communication and information retrieval for students       with disabilities.       an electronic community for those interested in SMET and       disability-related issues.       disability awareness presentations to faculty and staff.       college transition, library access, Web page design, and       adaptive technology workshops.       dissemination of program and disability-related information       through electronic resources, printed materials, and       videotapes.    The Institutionalization of DO-IT project follows logically from  DO-IT's previous activities.  It will continue efforts to empower  individuals with disabilities, make SMET programs and careers more  accessible, and explore strategies and implement activities to  institutionalize successful practices nationwide.  Project  strategies will include seeking state, Federal, corporate, and  private funding and sponsorship; selling project products; and  incorporating practices into existing services and publications at  the UW and elsewhere.",
