Thirty undergraduate physics students (in a three-year period, 1999-2001) coming from the continental United States and Puerto Rico will participate in a variety of on-going theoretical and experimental research projects.  Six experienced physics faculty members from the Physics and Electronics department at UPRH are involved in this initiative.  Each will supervise, mentor and work one-on-one with participating students.  For three consecutive years the NSF-REU site will operate during an eight-week period in the summer and will continue for students with residence in Puerto Rico into the academic year.  This program offers to Hispanic-American physics students the opportunity to engage in research projects under the guidance of a Hispanic-American faculty professor.  Weekly seminars and \"hands-on\" mini-workshops are planned to address basic computational and research techniques, such as numerical and symbolic programming, data acquisition, instrumental control, and web technology.  Participation in this program by women and minority students will be particularly encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program provides research experience for undergraduate students.  The aim of the National Science Foundation is to promote and advance scientific and engineering progress in the United States.  This requires continued efforts to attract a diversified pool of talented students into research careers in these fields and to help ensure that they receive the best education possible.\r\n ***\r\n",
