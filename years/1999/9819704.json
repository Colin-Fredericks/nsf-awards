 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this one-year grant is to permit the PI and his research group to continue their work on:\r\n\r\ni) Constitutive behavior of entangled polymers in fast steady sheer and\r\nii) In-situ fluorescence study of polymer adsorption and desorption with and without wall slip.\r\n\r\nA second purpose is to permit the PI to absorb and to be able to respond to the criticisms that were generated in response to the larger scale proposed research plan that was initially proposed.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the work associated with item (i) will move the investigator closer to an understanding of the phenomenon wherein the stress reaches a plateau in the presence of an increasing shear rate.  Similarly, the item (ii) objectives can be summarized as providing an enhanced understanding of the effect of surface conditions on the polymer flow behavior at the polymer/wall interface.  This study will include the effects of the associated molecular processes.\r\n",
