 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences under the \"Research Sites for Educators in Chemistry\" program.  Dr. Kelsey D. Cook is the Principal Investigator, and there are three co-Principal Investigators.  Several primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) that have already developed active programs of undergraduate chemical research are designated as \"partner PUIs.\"  This award will facilitate cooperative arrangements between the University, the Partner PUIs and a number of other PUIs located in Appalachia and elsewhere in the Southeast.  Faculty members in chemistry, biology, and other environmentally-related fields at participating PUIs will be eligible to apply for fellowships.  These fellowships will enable them to spend one semester in residence at the University, one semester at one of the partner PUIs, and one summer in full-time research, either at the University, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, or in the laboratories of certain \"industrial partners.\"  While in residence at the University and at the partner PUI, each fellow will participate in teaching, typically one course a semester.  The program will be enhanced by a partnership with the Appalachian College Association, which will assist in locating candidates.  Industrial partners will provide participants with industrial research workshops and/or internships.\r\n\r\nResearch Sites for Educators in Chemistry (RSEC) bring together the faculty of participating two-year colleges, baccalaureate colleges, and master's universities with faculty at research universities within a geographic region to enhance the research and educational opportunities at all participating institutions.  Academic and research institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learner perspectives.  RSECs such as this one at the University of Tennessee provide mechanisms for disseminating the knowledge, skills, practices and ethics of research to a broader community, including those from underrepresented groups; assist in developing viable, sustainable research programs at participating institutions; and involve faculty and students at the participating institutions with a broader cross-section of faculty and students.\r\n",
