 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific basis for the development of advanced materials and their record performance is founded on our fundamental understanding of the correlations between their properties and various aspects of the structure.  One of the most important new classes of glasses that are finding innumerable applications on the market place today are phosphate and phosphate-containing glasses. The wide compositions ranges over which phosphate and phosphate glasses can be prepared enable these glasses to be tailored for many different applications - optical, electrical, biomedical, and structural, at temperatures that are far more compatible with other low temperature materials such as plastics used in many applications such as telecommunications. While these glasses hold exceptional promise in enabling breakthrough technologies, these glasses are also among the least well studied of all oxide glasses.  It is to this critical information gap about this very important class of glasses that this first-ever conference on Phosphate and Phosphate Containing Glasses is directed.  This conference is organized under the auspices of the University Conference on Glass Science series to take advantage of its well established structure and low costs.  An international organizing committee is in place to coordinate the meeting.  The invited speakers include the top US and international researchers in this topical area. The conference will consist of morning and afternoon oral sessions and a poster session.  Attendance is estimated to be about 100 scientists from academia, national laboratories, and industry, with strong participation from students and young researchers.  The information presented and generated at the Conference will be published in the most widely read archival Journal on the subject.\r\n\tIn short, this conference will be the first ever such conference on phosphate and phosphate containing glasses.  It will bring together a broad range of glass scientists and engineers whose close interaction will naturally lead to cross-fertilization of new ideas and approaches to solving the many problems inherent in these complex glasses.  This conference will provide a catalyst for continued vigor in this area.\r\n***",
