 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of relatively simple and innovative mathematical procedures and computer algorithms for modeling, aligning, modifying and measuring large classes of manufactured objects that have free-form or sculptured shapes.  A new algorithm for decomposing two-dimensional algebraic curves as sums of products of simple lines and conics will play a major role in the development of these new procedures.  This algorithm will be used to describe free-form curves in terms of their primitives; to determine the pose of objects in arbitrary configurations; to modify existing implicit polynomial models both locally and globally; and to interpolate sculptured, three dimensional surfaces between two dimensional curves in parallel planes. A state-of-the-art coordinate measuring machine will be used in many of the proposed investigations to test, refine and verify the procedures\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will provide more user-friendly methods for modeling and measuring objects with complex contours, such as turbine blades, gears, ship hulls and automobile bodies; streamlined procedures for the computer aided geometric design of a large variety of manufactured objects; new techniques for measuring such objects more accurately and in less time using coordinate measuring machines; and the simplification of reverse engineering algorithms to produce objects for which there are no known technical drawings or specifications. This will reduce the cost and improve the quality of future manufactured products.  Furthermore, the underlying mathematical decomposition will lead to a far better understanding of higher degree algebraic curves, a fundamental mathematical subject that has been studied extensively since the 17th century by some of the world's most foremost mathematicians.  Algebraic curves are used widely in many different practical, technical areas, and adding insight relative to their underlying features will facilitate their use in these areas.",
