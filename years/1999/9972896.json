The Linguistic Institute, which is conducted every two years by the Linguistic Society of America, offers courses for college credit, sponsors concurrent scholarly conferences, and invites talks by eminent scholars for plenary sessions. This institute on methods will offer four two-week courses on methods in linguistic anthropology.  Students will earn one semester credit for each course completed.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of offering this institute on methods is to correct a perceived deficiency in the training of linguistic anthropologists. Because contemporary disciplinary structures are weak in linguistic anthropology, it is very hard for students to obtain practical training in the methods of their discipline. The methods institute will offer courses on linguistic elicitation, the analysis of gestures and body-language, the uses of videotape in linguistic anthropology, and the uses of computers in linguistic anthropology. The course on linguistic elicitation will include recording and transcription of topical lexicons and short narratives, discovery of native-language questions pertaining to the structure of nature and society, and the design of systematic sets of questions for the exploration of special topics. The course on the analysis gestures and body-language will show how this information can be used to discover cultural models of spatial information. The course on videotape will include methods of videotaping in the field, the analysis of videotaped communication, and the ethics of videotaping. The course on computers in linguistic anthropology will demonstrate how they can be used for the analysis of grammars, for the discovery of meaningful themes in data, for the discovery of historical relationships between languages, and for automatic translation.\r\n\r\nStudents in linguistic anthropology who attend the institute will also benefit from their association with the many outstanding scholars who attend the institute to teach and give talks at conferences and plenary sessions. The institute will help to foster the use of sound linguistic methods in the field of linguistic anthropology.\r\n\r\n",
