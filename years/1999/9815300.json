 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mazer\r\n9815300\r\n\r\nFlowering plants have evolved a variety of mechanisms that ensure pollination.  Many species are \"outcrossing\", relying on insects to transfer pollen, while others are self-fertilized (each flower pollinates itself).  The evolution of self-fertilization from outcrossing ancestors has often had similar outcomes.  For example, animal-pollinated outcrossers often produce larger flowers and higher ratios of pollen to ovule production per flower than closely related self-fertilizing species.  \r\n\r\nThis study asks:  Does natural selection operate as predicted to generate more subtle genetic differences between selfing and outcrossing species?  Several predictions will be tested, including that outcrossers are more likely than selfers to exhibit an inverse relationship between the allocation of resources to male vs. female function.  Three pairs of closely related outcrossing and self-fertilizing species in the wildflower genus Clarkia  will be compared with respect to genetic variation in, and genetically based correlations among, male and female reproductive traits.  Greenhouse and field experiments will be conducted to examine constraints on the independent evolution of floral traits in outcrossers vs. selfers.\r\n\r\nTen to twelve undergraduate students and one post-doctoral researcher will receive training in evolutionary theory, plant breeding and reproduction, statistical analysis, and the presentation of results.  This study will contribute to our understanding of both the potential and limits of natural selection to effect evolutionary changes associated with mating system.\r\n",
