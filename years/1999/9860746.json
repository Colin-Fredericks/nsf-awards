 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860746\r\n     Biofouling, the growth of microbiologically active films (biofilms) on surfaces, adversely  affects  both the short and long term performance of many aqueous systems. Efficiency of heat exchangers is degraded by the thermal resistance of biofilms, increased pressure and decreased flow accompany the constriction of piping systems fouled with biofilms, and microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) contributes to the reduction of system lifetimes. Open-loop seawater or fresh water systems are of particular concern because biocide contaminant levels in discharge water are subject to regulation.\r\nMonitoring biofilm development in real time would allow for optimization of biofouling control strategies, which would reduce system operating and maintenance costs and reduce environmental pollution.\r\nIn this Phase I effort, Sensor Research and Development Corporation intends to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the mature technology of the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) in a novel configuration to monitor the growth of seawater biofilms in real time. The monitor is expected to be low cost, compact, and rugged; allowing for its widespread use in the control of biofouling in many applications.\r\n     A real time biofouling monitor will provide information on the development of biofilms on the surfaces of piping and cooling systems prior to the manifestation of overall system performance degradation, thereby allowing for control strategies that will minimize biocide use, maximize system performance, and provide confidence that system parameters are within an acceptable range. Markets include: shipboard cooling systems, both seawater and freshwater based; on-shore power plants utilizing seawater or freshwater cooling; aquaculture seawater systems; and food industry processing systems.\r\n",
