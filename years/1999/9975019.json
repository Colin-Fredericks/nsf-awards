To create such capabilities they will develop composition techniques that enable models to interact with each other, share state, events or results, and ability for scalable modeling.\r\n\r\nThe compiler and runtime support system will design resource-aware algorithms for program transformations, a multilingual resource-aware optimizing compiler, and low-overhead, adaptive run-time support to be generated by the compiler and embedded in user code.  By using information about application internals and knowledge of the target architectures will develop techniques that will produce executable code that scales dynamically and is responsive to reconfigurations in the type and number of system resources.\r\n\r\nThe modeling, compilation and runtime techniques above will be synergistically combined to obtain an integrated compiler/runtime/performance engineering framework, and they will demonstrate the abilities of such a framework with applications like face-tracking, video filtering and indexing. \r\n",
