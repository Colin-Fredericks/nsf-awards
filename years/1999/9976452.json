The application domains addressed include transform coding, data visualization, and sensor fusion, with initial focus on image processing.  Theoretical focus is on securing  a foundation for the algorithms in terms of generative (probabilistic) models.  Applications to be explored include sensor fusion to improve the quality of airport radio, and video data compression to improve the performance at systems like Internet video communications.\r\n\r\nA class of constrained mixture models that incorporate latent, unobserved variables together with probabilistic maps int0 observed data space has suitable properties; they naturally express nonlinear PCA, and they contain mixture, or local linear PCA (as well as standard PCA) in appropriate limits.  Hence these models can serve as an organizing focus behind algorithms for coding, visualization, and fusion that are related to nonlinear PCA.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop these models, their theoretical properties, the art of fitting and regularizing them, and their application to coding and visualization.  The models are capable of expressing, both cluster structure, and curved surface models of data, and are thus well suited for visualization.  Such probabilistic models can help illuminate other relation between nonlinear PCA and independent component analysis (ICA).\r\n***\r\n",
