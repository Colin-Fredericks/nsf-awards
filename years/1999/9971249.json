 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical equations describing waves in fluids, plasmas, and optical fibers \r\nare extremely complex.  Usually they can be solved only on high speed computers. \r\nHowever, it is often possible to approximate these complex problems with simpler \r\nequations whose solutions can be written in explicit analytical form. \r\nSuch equations are called ``solvable models'', and have been known for years. \r\nAn example is the Korteweg-deVries equation, which models waves of the \r\nsurface of water and acoustic waves in plasmas.  It was discovered in \r\n1877 by Boussinesq, but the derivation was not rigorous.  Numerical \r\nexperiments on the ion acoustic plasma equations have shown convincingly \r\nthat this approximation is robust - that is, that the validity of the \r\nmodel extends far beyond the small parameter range for which it was \r\nformally derived. This award will support a mathematically rigorous proof\r\nfor this conjecture. The analysis of other such models will also be \r\ncarried out. Among these are model equations for shallow water waves that\r\nwere proposed by Camassa and Holm of Los Alamos National Lab, and solvable \r\nmodels that are associated with Hele-Shaw flows (flows of two immiscible \r\nliquids between two plates).\r\n\r\nMany physical phenomena have complicated mathematical descriptions that can\r\nbe reduced to simpler models in certain limiting cases.  An example is the \r\ndescription of surface waves in an ocean.  The full description involves a\r\ncomplicated system of equations that has to be solved on a supercomputer\r\nin each special instance of the problem. However, in the important special \r\ncase of shallow water and unidirectional waves, a much simpler equation has been \r\nproposed as an approximation.  While this simpler equation can be \r\nstudied in great detail and much more thoroughly than with any numerical \r\nsimulation, the question arises for which physical parameters (in this case water\r\ndepth and wave height) the approximate description is indeed correct.  These\r\nquestions have in the past led to serious scientific disputes, and there are \r\nvery few cases where they have been resolved by rigorous mathematical analysis.\r\nTheir resolution is very desirable for purely intellectual reasons and to \r\nvalidate numerical simulations.  The award will support work to establish \r\nthe validity of such reduced equations in a related situation (waves in plasmas)\r\nand the study of other reduced equations that describe fluid flow phenomena. \r\n\r\n",
