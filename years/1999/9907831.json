 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this proposal is to examine the role of attention training in providing a basis for the rapid learning of high level skills involved in reading and using numbers.  In addition we wish to examine changes in the brain that accompany initial exposure to reading and number processing.   Prior research using imaging and high density electrical recording has led us to believe that we should see signficant impact on specific brain areas involved in understanding words and using digits in order to determine quantity.              \r\n\r\n\r\nThe ability of the child to attend to the relevant sensory input and to select the appropriate strategies are critical elements of these skills.  We plan to compare groups of 5 year olds who undergo training of executive attention with age matched control without such training.  After the training we will examine the ability of the two groups to profit from systematic lessons designed to improve specific subskills of reading and number processing.  These sessions will last ten weeks.  \r\n\r\n We will use fMRI and high density electrical recording to examine changes in brain areas and in connections that might occur as a result of the learning. Our previous work has revealed specific brain areas critical to reading that should be changed with acquisition of the skill and quite different brain areas critical to the estimation of quantity.  We hypothesize that the learning of the two skills will influence quite different brain regions. \r\n     \r\n If we are successful with our attention training we expect that the trained children will acquire the skills more rapidly and then produce higher correlations between the two skills.  If the attention training both improved the learning of the two individual skills and increased the correlation between them it will support the idea that attention training is a general component that should be considered as an adjunct of all early child curricula. \r\n\r\n     \t\t\t\t \r\n\r\n",
