 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe success of coral reefs in nutrient-poor waters is traditionally attributed to nutrient recycling between the coral host and its symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae).  For nitrogen recycling to occur, zooxanthellae would synthesize amino acids from host ammonium, then return the products to the host.  This project will utilize stable isotopes to trace reef synthesis of amino acids, and their flux between the symbiotic partners.  The nitrogen cycle, starting in the animal, will be marked using 15N-labeled prey, and 13C will be used to label the carbon cycle via photosynthesis by zooxanthellae.  Individual amino acids will then be assayed for both labels using mass spectroscopy.\r\n\t\r\nIn addition to providing a greater understanding of the host-symbiont interaction, this research also addresses two controversial issues within coral nutrition.  Recent evidence suggests the host and algae independently conserve nutrients, rather than recycling nutrients between partners.  The timing and distribution of the isotopic tracers will help discriminate between these hypotheses.  In addition, corals can reportedly produce amino acids that other animals are unable to synthesize.  The dual-label approach used here can help determine which \"essential\" amino acids the coral can produce itself, and which it must obtain through its diet.\r\n",
