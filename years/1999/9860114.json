 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860114\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research project will study the feasibility of commercializing a new lithium salt for Rechargeable Solid Lithium Batteries. These batteries are not commercially available, due to the problems related to the commercialization of a key part of the battery, the solid polymeric electrolyte (SPE). New materials are needed that will improve the performance of the SPE while maintaining a simple and cost effective formulation. To that end, this project will outline the design, synthesis and testing of a new lithium salt that will improve and simplify any given SPE. A multifunctional salt is presented that will both improve the conductivity and the morphology of the SPE by combining two key features, low lattice energy and plasticizing ability. The salt will be synthesized using well-documented procedures, formulated into test SPEs and evaluated and compared with the industry-wide standard commercially available lithium salt, lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. This Phase I research plan will concentrate on direct comparisons between the salt used currently and the new salt described in this proposal.\r\n     Solid state ion-conducting electrolytes can be used in a wide range of commercial applications. Flexible rechargeable lithium batteries will be used in mobile communication equipment, laptop computers, and electric vehicles. Outside of the battery industry, ion-conducting membranes will be applied to electrochemical sensors and artificial muscles.\r\n",
