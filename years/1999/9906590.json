Serel,  a focal point for stimulating student research, will be enhanced with networks, computers, and server capabilities to further research in software engineering.  The award will also be used to prepare the CIS Department for CSAB accreditation.  Software Engineering methods, techniques, and tools will be developed further to:\r\nPredict execution times of code segments by examining object code generated\r\nExtend UML with Real-Time Architecture Specification (RAS) and Real-Time Computational Tree Logic (RTCTL)\r\nAdapt spoken language dialogues allowing linguistic knowledge to evolve the dialogues\r\nBuild a system prototype to \"compute with words\" that provides users the freedom, to use their natural language protocols\r\nDevelop testing techniques and tools\r\nDevelop methods and algorithms for information retrieval from structured un-structured data sources using ontological knowledge domains \r\n\r\nWhile increasing the participation of women and minorities in graduate education, the project will facilitate, enhance, and intensify research in CISE areas.  Through this effort, FAMU is expected to develop further its computer and information science and software engineering research capabilities involving minority students in greater numbers, paving the way for the conferring of more doctoral degrees to under-represented groups, particularly African Americans and women in Computer Information Science and Engineering.  It is hoped that through these efforts, the nation might find a successful model that will help in building a better racially and ethnically balanced technological enterprise for the benefit of its present and future generations. \r\n",
