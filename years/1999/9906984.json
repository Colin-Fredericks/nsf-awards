 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9906984\r\nSteckl\r\n\r\nThis proposal to NSF discusses a high density archival optical memory structure using biphotonic upconversion photoemission from rare-earth-doped semiconductors (such as GaN) and insulators (especially heavy metal fluoride glasses such as ZBLAN). We plan to utilize focused ion beam (FIB) techniques as the means for densely \"writing\" the memory with localized packets of rare earth (RE) species. We will use two lasers of different photon energy to perform selective \"reading\" of the data through the two-step, two-energy upconversion process in certain rare earth ions (such as Pr, Er, Tm). We have obtained preliminary results on the critical ingredients of our proposed approach: (1) fabrication of FIB sources for RE implantation; (2) FIB implantation of Pr into GaN and evidence of strong photoemission; (3) FIB milling of microcavities in ZBLAN; (4) biphotonic emission from ZBLAN; (5) fabrication and characterization of a monolithically integrated CMOS based photodetector/receiver array that provides a tunable optical power threshold and is highly sensitive to low power optical signals. Further, we have constructed an optical storage media characterization system that allows us to evaluate the viability of RE-doped samples generated for optical storage applications. In addition to allowing visual inspection of RE doped samples under various optical excitation schemes, the characterization system we have developed provides the capability to perform optical characterization (spectroscopic and optical power measurements) on single/multiple data bits. Finally, the characterization system incorporates the CMOS photoreceiver array into a pseudo read-head assembly that allows for bit-oriented, word-oriented or page-oriented reading of an RE-doped optical storage media.\r\n\r\nOur preliminary results indicate the feasibility of the overall optical memory concept which we have developed. In the work proposed here, we plan to investigate the limits of the FIB write process for obtaining maximum bit storage density and approaches for obtaining the highest signal-to noise ratio in the biphotonic read operation. To evaluate the memory performance parameters (such as data rate, access time, bit error rate, bit-cross-talk and page-cross-talk), we plan to design, fabricate and characterize storage media and detection structures containing arrays of 103 bits.\r\n\r\n",
