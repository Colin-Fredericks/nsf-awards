Gassman\r\n\r\nABSTRACT:\r\nThis CAREER award investigates an integrated approach to research and\r\neducation in non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of civil infrastructure\r\nsystems. Much of the civil infrastructure in the United States is\r\ndeteriorating due to age, inadequate investment in proper maintenance, and\r\nincreased system demand.  NDE can provide fast and reliable assessment\r\ntechniques that are needed to handle the large volume of deteriorating civil\r\nsystems, particularly bridges, that pose serious threats to safety if they\r\nfail.  The focus of this research is to develop a NDE technique based on\r\nstress wave principles to efficiently and accurately assess the integrity of\r\nmicropile foundations that are used to support existing foundations of aging\r\nbridges and buildings during rehabilitation. This work consists of 1)\r\nlaboratory investigations on micropile foundations using a combination of\r\nlongitudinal and flexural wave methods with surface and embedded sensors, 2)\r\nanalytical studies related to signal processing and numerical simulation,\r\nand 3) field investigations of in situ micropiles. Although NDE is well\r\nestablished and confirmed by extensive site experience for drilled shafts\r\nand driven concrete piles, the technique is uncertain for slender piles with\r\nhigh length-to-diameter ratios and piles with multiple changes in\r\ncross-sectional dimensions.  Thus, this work will study the fundamental\r\nrelationship between slender micropile foundations and the surrounding soil,\r\nthe effect of multiple changes in cross-sectional area on wave propagation\r\nand the received signals, and the dispersive effects of the concrete used\r\nfor micropile construction.  An education plan is integrated with the\r\nproposed research to incorporate infrastructure assessment, rehabilitation,\r\nand monitoring technologies into the civil engineering curriculum at the\r\nUniversity of South Carolina.  Education is critically needed in the areas\r\nof infrastructure failure, inspection, and rehabilitation to give both\r\nstudents and the engineering workforce the skills to revitalize and preserve\r\nour nation's civil infrastructure. Furthermore, the plan proposes to\r\nintegrate NDE research methodology into course work, provide increased\r\nresearch opportunities for undergraduates, and increase participation of\r\ntraditionally under-represented groups\r\n",
