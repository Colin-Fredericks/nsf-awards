 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops efficient numerical methods for\r\nmulti-dimensional signal reconstruction using tools from harmonic\r\nanalysis such as local trigonometric transforms and wavelets.\r\nThe reconstruction problems that are considered range from\r\napproximation of nonstationary signals from scattered data to\r\nrecovery of missing data in digital image sequences.  Successful\r\nsolution of these reconstruction problems requires a priori\r\ninformation about the signal, otherwise these problems are\r\nill-posed.  Often this a priori knowledge can be derived from\r\nphysical properties of the process, for instance in terms of the\r\n\"local frequency behavior\" of the signal.  Local trigonometric\r\ntransforms and wavelets have become powerful methods for\r\nanalysis, compression and denoising of digital signals.  The\r\ninvestigator derives a mathematical framework for the application\r\nof these concepts to signal and image reconstruction (beyond the\r\nwell-traversed area of denoising).  The design of these\r\nreconstruction methods is accompanied by the development of\r\nmulti-level regularization techniques in order to provide a\r\nflexible framework for the incorporation of different kinds of a\r\npriori knowledge about the signal.  The investigator applies the\r\nnew numerical methods to the approximation of geophysical signals\r\nfrom scattered data and to error correction in received coded bit\r\nstreams.\r\n     This project is motivated by a number of multi-dimensional\r\nsignal reconstruction problems arising in areas as diverse as\r\nexploration geophysics, medical imaging, and telecommunication.\r\nIn order to optimally compress, transmit or analyze an incomplete\r\nor distorted signal, it is necessary to first reconstruct the\r\noriginal signal from the available data.  This reconstruction\r\nprocess includes the restoration of lost data as well as the\r\nrecovery of a signal from scattered noisy measurements.  The\r\nmathematical framework being developed here allows the design of\r\nflexible and robust algorithms for the reconstruction of\r\nmulti-dimensional signals.  Due to huge amount of data and\r\npossibly required real-time processing the reconstruction\r\nalgorithms must also be fast and efficient.  The derived\r\nnumerical methods are important for reliable error correction in\r\ndata transmission, for efficient reconstruction of geophysical\r\nsignals, and for other applications.",
