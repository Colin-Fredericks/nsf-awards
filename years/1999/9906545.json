 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on global change has highlighted many important forms of interaction between the atmosphere and biosphere.  One facet that has received relatively little attention, however, has been the given to changes in the biogeochemistry that altered regimes of precipitation will have on ecosystems.  Among questions remaining to be answered are:  How will global change affect element cycling in deciduous forests?  What will be the environmental feedbacks of any significant changes?  Might there be differences in the influences of co-occurring tree species on these element cycles?  Might their influences differ seasonally?  Canopy trees dominating broad-leaved deciduous forest ecosystems have been assumed to have a limited effect on mid-winter hydrochemistry because of their leafless condition.  The woody frames of canopy trees, however, present a wide range of bark types that vary in their surface area, texture, roughness, water holding capacity, albedo, and leachability.  This doctoral dissertation research project will examine canopy structure, woody surfaces, meteorological conditions, and winter precipitation inputs to the forest floor in order to create a new empirical framework for evaluating the hydrochemical consequences of global change in broad-leaved deciduous forest ecosystems.  The proposed study will involve laboratory-based determinations of bark water-holding capacity, air-drying rates, texture, and morphology; field-based experiments on branch inclination angles; photogrammetric analysis of large-scale aerial photos and 3-D modeling of branching geometry and total woody surface area of a representative sample of canopy trees; continuous recording of canopy-level meteorological conditions at the selected field site; hydrochemical analysis of water drainage from the selected sample trees on a precipitation-event basis and at hourly intervals during rain-on-snow events; and statistical analyses of the relationships between leachate chemistry, meteorological conditions, and leafless canopy structure.  This project will provide new insights into the seasonality of element cycling and how it might be altered by changing climatic regimes.  The results will help improve models of biogeochemical cycling and will generate methodological advances in the quantification of the influence of the leafless above-ground woody frames of trees on forest biogeochemistry.  The project will have significant utility in the northeastern U.S., where broad-leaved deciduous forest constitutes a large proportion of the vegetative cover and nearly 50% of the annual stream discharge originates from snowmelt.  In particular, it will help assess whether some tree species, particularly the red oak (Quercus rubra), are subject to extreme leaching and possible destruction under the mixed precipitation regimes expected in coming decades.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
