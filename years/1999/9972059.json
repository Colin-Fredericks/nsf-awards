 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972059\r\nSilber\r\n\r\nThe research project addresses the formation of free surface standing wave \r\npatterns that arise when a container of fluid is vibrated vertically. This \r\nwell-studied hydrodynamic problem represents a model system for \r\nstudying pattern formation via symmetry-breaking parametric instability. \r\nUnderstanding the dynamical mechanism for the experimentally observed \r\n\"superlattice patterns\" is a primary focus for much of the research.  These \r\ntwo-dimensional wave patterns are characterized as being spatially-\r\nperiodic, with structure on two disparate length scales.  The analysis will \r\nbe based on methods of equivariant bifurcation theory.  The role of normal \r\nform symmetries, and spatial/temporal resonance in the pattern selection \r\nprocess will be elucidated by the analysis. Aspects of the research project \r\nwill contribute to our understanding of the effects of weak external \r\nsymmetry breaking on equivariant bifurcation problems. It will also \r\ndevelop applications of some recent mathematical results on bifurcation of \r\nperiodic solutions with spatio-temporal symmetries.  Finally, possible \r\nsymmetry-based methods for controlling spatio-temporal patterns will be \r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nThe research project is aimed at a basic mathematical understanding of a \r\nvariety of experimental observations of exotic wave patterns on the \r\nsurface of a vibrated liquid. The results are expected to carry over to other \r\npattern-forming systems of technological interest, such as magnetic fluids \r\nand nonlinear optical systems. The research will contribute to our basic \r\nunderstanding of the effects of vibration on nonlinear systems with many \r\ndegrees of freedom; vibration that may be detrimental because it causes \r\ninstability or useful because it suppresses instability. The research will \r\nalso address control of the nonlinear pattern-formation process in certain \r\nhydrodynamic, nonlinear optical and chemical reaction-diffusion systems. \r\nThe training of graduate students in applied mathematics is an integral part \r\nof the research project.\r\n",
