This award supports education and a broad research program in statistical mechanics with the aim of a better understanding of macroscopic phenomena, such as phase transitions in equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems, originating in the cooperative behavior of the microscopic constituents of matter. Specific topics for investigation include: extending recent work with the aim of developing a continuum theory of phase transitions such as boiling and melting; the problem of the kinetics of phase segregation of continuum fluids and alloys that occurs following the sudden cooling from a uniform high temperature phase into a coexistence region, with a particular focus on elastic alloys subjected to external stresses; the properties of stationary nonequilibrium states of macroscopic systems, such as those carrying steady state currents; and the quantum description of macroscopic systems which includes fluctuations and large deviations in equilibrium and irreversible behavior in nonequilibrium systems.    \r\n%%% \r\nThis grant is supported by the Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research, the Mathematical Physics Activity in the Physics Division and the Applied Mathematics Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences. Research will be done on a number of problems in statistical mechanics which will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between the large-scale behavior of matter, e.g., fluids, and its underlying particulate nature, e.g., molecules. This research is fundamental, but strategic issues associated with many problems of practical interest are addressed.\r\n***\r\n",
