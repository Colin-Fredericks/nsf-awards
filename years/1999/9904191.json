Block copolymers are industrially and scientifically important materials, finding a wide range of applications including use as tough plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, compatibilizers for polymer blends, and as surface modifiers.  It is anticipated that use of polymeric materials will further expand in the 21st century due to their versatility, low cost, and lightweight.  The symposium will bring together established international leaders and top new investigators in the areas of block copolymer synthesis, morphology, properties, and applications.  Top industrial scientists will also participate in the Symposium.  The goal of the meeting is to evaluate the current state of knowledge in the field and chart a course for future investigations and applications.\r\n\r\nThe NSF funds will be used to partially support the travel and meeting costs for selected graduate students and postdocs.  This will assure that an adequate number of young scientists and engineers working in this area will be exposed to the current leaders and state-of-the-art concepts.  These young scientists are the future of the field.  The application and evaluation process used for awarding these \"travel grants\" will assure that women and other traditionally under-represented groups will be able to participate in the Symposium.  This will help prepare them to play leading roles in block copolymer research of the next millennium.\r\n",
