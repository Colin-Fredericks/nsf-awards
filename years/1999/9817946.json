 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program will examine the manner in which large-scale circulations control thc structure and intensity of the intense core regions of Atlantic hurricanes.  The project will focus on diagnostics, but will contain a numerical modeling component.  The observational study will use data from research aircraft to analyze symmetric and asymmetric features of the distributions of wind, rain and vorticity in the hurricane eyewall region.  Data sources will include in-situ measurements along the flight path, radar reflectivity and Doppler radar measurements, and dropwinsonde data.  The dropwinsonde data are crucial as they will allow the analyses to be extended outward from the core to 1,000-2,000 km radius, a region in which the flow differs significantly from that resolved by global analysis fields due to storm-environmental interactions.\r\n\r\nThe numerical modeling portion of the study will primarily be a pilot effort and will use the nonhydrostatic version of the Penn State NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) with triply nested grids.  The innermost mesh size will be 5 km (with some final runs at 3 km), and moist convective processes on this mesh will be resolved with the explicit moisture scheme.  The simulations will be initialized with data from a subset of the cases analyzed as part of the observational component of the study.  The interactive use of numerical simulations and diagnostic analyses of aircraft and large-scale data will allow detailed study of the nature of interactions between the large-scale flow and the intensity and structure of the hurricane's core. Since the large-scale flow is becoming increasingly well predicted over time scales of interest to hurricane forecasting (0-5 days), determining the manner in which the large-scale flow controls the intensity and the distribution of wind, rain and related phenomena in the core should lead to improved predictability of these important quantities.\r\n",
