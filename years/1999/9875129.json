The research activity is aimed at opening a new interface between materials science and nanotechnology. A novel strategy is employed for fabricating nanoscale conducting pathways in silicon by epitaxially encapsulating atomically ordered 2D dopant patterns; this involves (1)patterning H-terminated Si surfaces by desorbing H-atoms with an e-beam from a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), (2)dosing with dopant-containing precursors such as PH3 and B2H6 which react with bare Si but not with Si-H surfaces. The precursor molecules form self-ordered arrays when adsorbed onto bare Si, which help to avoid dopant clustering and ensure uniform coverage within the STM-exposed regions, (3)overgrowth of epitaxial Si to activate individual dopants and encapsulate these nanoscale circuit patterns into bulk silicon. A primary objective is to study electron transport between nanoscale dopant patterns controlled by a gate voltage. When electrically activated, the Bohr radius for individual donors such as P or As is roughly 2.5 nm, so that electrically each dopant atom is ~5 nm in diameter at low temperatures. Wavefunctions on different donor sites begin to overlap at separations of ~10 nm, causing tunneling and preventing carrier freeze-out at average densities in excess of 108 cm-3. The ability to accurately position dopants on a scale smaller than 10 nm thus implies the potential for detailed control over wavefunction overlap and a possible means to fabricate artificial conducting lattices of any desired 2D geometry. 3D circuits may be realized by repeating the three-step process.\r\nSelective deposition and decomposition of precursor molecules on various Si hydride surfaces and epitaxial growth of Si layers over the dopant-saturated patterns will be systematically studied. Processes from initial surface preparation to final electrical contact will be assessed for preservation of the nanoscale buried dopant patterns. Low-temperature characterization techniques will be developed to monitor the electrical properties of the fabricated structures.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic materials and advanced devices. The scope of the project will expose students to challenges from materials growth, surface physics, surface chemistry, and device physics. An important feature of the program is the emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and education to enhance learning through discovery through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant research area. Integrated skills and knowledge in these areas will provide a solid basis for future careers in materials science, physics, and electron device technology.\r\n",
