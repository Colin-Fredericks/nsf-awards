This project investigates the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of STs preferring\r\nphenolic substrates (PSTs).  First,  the regulation of purified recombinant bovine PST by CoA and its thioesters is characterized by steady state kinetic measurements, affinity absorption, and fluorescence quenching. Second,  the structures of CoA molecules and ST-bound PAP are compared using workstation energy  minimization studies.   Docking software models the interactions of CoAs with the active site of a reported ST structure.  Third, PST thiol reactivity toward CoA and its thioesters tests the existence of a chemical covalent  mechanism. The fourth aim investigates PST subunit  interactions through characterization of purified tryptophan replacement mutant enzymes, by kinetic and physical methods such as fluorescence quenching.  Fifth, a currently unidentified fluorophore observed prior to catalysis when PST\r\nbinds 7-hydroxycoumarin will be examined.  Enhancement of this band by 280 nm excitation suggests resonant energy transfer  from tryptophan(s) to the ligand.   The group(s) involved will be determined using the PST mutants. In summary, this project investigates ST regulation by a ubiquitous factor of intermediary metabolism, and it explores changes in the protein and substrate that contribute to ST catalysis.\r\n\r\nMetabolism of some steroids, neurotransmitters, other hormones, drugs, and pollutants frequently involves a family of enzymes known as sulfotransferases (STs).   In this project, the investigators examine the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of a subclass of STs.  One novel observation is the inhibition of an ST by a common biochemical, CoA, derived from the vitamin pantotheine.  CoA normally  functions as a carrier of fatty acids;  therefore, this investigation may connect metabolism and diet.  Molecular computational approaches will model the CoA-ST interaction.  The investigators will also create mutant ST enzymes, using recombinant DNA technology, to study aspects of ST mechanisms. \r\n",
