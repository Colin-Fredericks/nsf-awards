Technical\r\n\r\nThis study concerns the structure and function of ribosomal RNA\r\nusing genetic approaches.  The central tool is the plasmid pKK3535 (which carries the full rrnB ribosomal Rna operon from E. coli) and several of its derivatives, including inducible plasmids such as pSTL102 (which carries drug-resistant mutant alleles of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes).  Mutations are created in these constructs, either randomly or by site-directed mutagenesis, and their ribosomal phenotypes studied in vivo and in vitro. Both dominant and recessive mutants of rRNA are studied using this system. RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein interactions are analyzed by suppressor analysis of second-site mutations that arise either within the cloned rRNA genes or in the cellular genome. The central questions that are addressed in these studies focus on the structural dynamics of ribosomal RNA, which is believed to be fundamental to the mechanism of translation.  Potential examples of rRNA dynamics have emerged from analysis of changes in the accessibilties of bases in rRNA to biochemical probes in various functional complexes, including: (1) protection of the 530 loop of 16S rRNA from chemical probes upon tRNA binding, which cannot be fully accounted for by direct contact of the 530 loop with tRNA; (2) protection of \"Class III Sites\" in 16S rRNA upon binding of tRNA, antibiotics or 50S subunits to 30S subunits; (3) enhanced reactivity of A2602 of 23S rRNA upon binding of tRNA; (4) protection of certain basesin domain IV of 23S rRNA upon binding of tRNA; and (5) the large number of bases protected in 23S rRNA by the small aminoacyl-CCA oligonucleotide analogue of the 3'-terminus of tRNA. The many experimental difficulties associated with studying mutant rRNA will be addressed by using experimental strategies such as bead capture of aptamer-tagged mutant rRNA and allele-specific chemical probing, in addition to genetic approaches based on the extensively developed rRNA expression vectors mentioned above.\r\n\r\n2. Non Technical\r\n\r\nRibosomes are responsible for synthesis of proteins in all living cells, using the genetic code to translate the nucleotide sequence of messenger RNA into the amino acid sequence of the protein chain.  Ribosomes are ancient and enormously complicated molecular machines, which are themselves constructed from both RNA and proteins.  Thus, ribosomes are of fundamental importance to biology.  A large number of well-known antibiotics are known to act by blocking the function of bacterial ribosomes.  Most of these antibiotics appear to interact witih ribosomal RNA, in keeping with our emerging belief that it is the ribosomal RNA, rather than its proteins, which is the main functional component of this molecular machine.  This study is designed to use the powerful methods of molecular genetics to dissect the role of ribosomal RNA in protein synthesis.  The central qustions in these studies are: can the \"moving parts\" of the machine can be identified, and can their function within the ribosome in living cells be deduced? The working hypothesis is that many, if not all, of these moving parts will turn out to be made of ribosomal RNA.  This study is aimed at finding out which parts of the RNA move, what they interact with during protein synthesis, and how their movement is coupled to the fundamental workings of the ribosome. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
