 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous problems in the area of distribution and in urban services require decisions about best choices of facility locations, including warehousing, service centers, and retailing decisions.  Computer models can be used to help with these decisions.  Such computer models usually require information on where the customers (referred to as demand points) are, how many of them there are, and what their demands are.  In many computer model applications, the demand points can number in the millions.  Even if all the demand point data is available, it is usually infeasible to include it all in the models.  Instead, demand points are usually aggregated; for example, all the demand points in one postal code area may be assumed to be at the center of the postal code area.  This aggregation reduces the size of the model, but also creates modeling error.  Aggregation schemes typically used in practice are usually ad-hoc, make little or no use of the problem structure, and generally show no concern for them aggregation error.  This proposal addresses means of doing demand point aggregation so as to keep the error to manageable limits.  For various classes of location problems, the development of aggregation methods that build on previous work is proposed.  Model parameters that affect the error will be studied, and computer testing of the aggregation methods will be performed.\r\n     The research should contribute to a cumulative body of knowledge that will eventually result in demand point aggregation problems being better understood and solved.  Location analysts will be better able to balance the quality of the solutions needed from computer models with the error introduced by the aggregation. The results of the research should be helpful in allowing better decisions about facility\r\nsiting when such decisions are based on computer modeling.  The results should be useful to urban and regional planners, transportation/logistics specialists, and geographers, all of whom at times are involved in choosing aggregation methods for large-scale location problems.\r\n\r\n",
