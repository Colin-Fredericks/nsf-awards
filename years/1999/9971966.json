 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nAward:  DMS-9971966 \r\nPrincipal Investigator:  Emma Previato\r\n\r\nThe project consists of three parts and concerns constructions in\r\nalgebraic geometry and solutions to partal differential\r\nequations.  Part I uses differential algebra to investigate open\r\nproblems of the KP hierarchy: Ritt's theory of constructive\r\ndifferential algebra will be applied to characterize maximal\r\ncommutative rings of ordinary/partial differential operators;\r\ndifferential resultants will be implemented to express\r\nhigher-dimensional reciprocity laws.  In part II, a connection is\r\nestablished between rank-2 vector bundles with canonical\r\ndeterminant over an algebraic curve, and varieties containing the\r\ncanonical curve.  By this technique, equations for important loci\r\nof bundles will be sought, as well as the significance of these\r\nloci in 2-Theta space, where the moduli space of bundles embeds,\r\nwith applications to the Schottky problem, for the 2-Theta space\r\nof a principally polarized abelian variety.  These equations for\r\nmoduli spaces of bundles have potential applications to explicit\r\nintegration of systems of Hitchin type.  Part III will link\r\nintegrable systems and Frobenius manifolds, by producing a\r\nsymplecto-geometric interpretation of canonical and flat\r\ncoordinates on Hurwitz spaces.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work spans the areas of algebraic geometry and\r\ndifferential equations.  While algebraic geometry has been a\r\nfield of basic research since the nineteenth century, in recent\r\nyears it has found applications to mathematical physics.  This\r\nproject explores new techniques to give answers to open problems\r\nof classical algebraic geometry such as equations for certain\r\nmoduli spaces, or the number of polynomials of a given type that\r\ndefine a canonical curve; it also explores new applications of\r\nthese algebraic structures to the exact solution of partial\r\ndifferential equations that model physical phenomena, from water\r\nwaves to quantum-field-theory.  One new component is the use of\r\ncomputer algebra systems, or symbolic computation, to implement\r\nclassical theories.  The computational focus will be an explicit\r\ndefinition of algebraic varieties via differential equations; by\r\nrunning the program through several classes of examples, which\r\nused to be unfeasible manually, conjectures will be tested and\r\nproperties sought to characterize unknown features of these\r\nspectral varieties.  Applications of technology to fields such as\r\nalgebraic geometry has attracted great recent interest, including\r\nprograms like \"Symbolic Computation in Geometry and Analysis\" at\r\nMSRI (Fall 1998).  This project will produce MAPLE packages which\r\nwill be made publicly available to other researchers.\r\n",
