 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is the ultimate source of all above ground\r\ntissues of the plant.  The SAM gives rise to leaves, stems, flowers, and\r\naxillary buds, and is responsible for the pattern of the shoot.  Despite\r\nthe crucial role of the shoot apical meristem in plant development, almost\r\nnothing is known about the mechanisms by which organs are produced from the\r\nflanks of this structure.  Using a novel mutagenesis system, enhancer trap\r\n(ET) and gene trap (GT) transposant lines that exhibit GUS reporter gene\r\nexpression in discrete domains in the SAM or surrounding cells have been\r\nidentified.  Two transposant lines show GUS expression specific to the SAM.\r\n The genes controlling GUS expression in these lines could play a role in\r\nSAM identity and/or function.  Eight transposant lines have been identified\r\nthat show GUS expression in discrete, novel domains surrounding the SAM.\r\nThese expression patterns do not appear to reflect anatomical or\r\nmorphological features, but define new domains based on gene expression.\r\nThe genes controlling GUS expression in these lines may function to define\r\nboundaries during organ initiation.  These lines were identified based on\r\nGUS expression patterns, and the genes controlling that expression are of\r\nunknown function.  A series of analyses will be performed in order to begin\r\nto understand the role that these genes play in meristem function and\r\norganogenesis.  The genes will be cloned and sequenced, and a detailed\r\ncharacterization of their expression patterns will be performed.  In order\r\nto identify genetic relationships between genes that function in the\r\nmeristem, GUS expression in our gene trap and enhancer trap lines will be\r\nexamined in backgrounds containing mutations that affect meristem function,\r\nand in transgenic plants that ectopically express selected meristem genes.  \r\n\r\nThe educational component of this proposal is geared towards training\r\nundergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in modern\r\nmethods in Arabidopsis research.  Arabidopsis thaliana is a model organism\r\nfor studies in plant biology.  The many available Arabidopsis resources are\r\nof use to all plant biology researchers.  In order for plant biology\r\nresearchers to be able to take full advantage of the Arabidopsis resources\r\nthat are available, it is important that they be familiar with the standard\r\nmethods used in Arabidopsis research.  To this end, an intensive laboratory\r\ncourse will be developed, that will teach standard Arabidopsis methods.\r\nMaterials from the PI's research program will be used for the laboratories.\r\n In addition, the PI will serve as a mentor to graduate students and\r\npostdoctoral researchers who will carry out the research component of this\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
