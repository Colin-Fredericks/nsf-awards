 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is adapting, implementing, and refining a GIS curriculum modeled on existing successful GIS programs across the country; and 2) constructing a more complete GIS computer laboratory for instruction in GIS and remote sensing technologies and applied undergraduate research. The primary users of the lab are undergraduates enrolled in the University's GIS certificate program.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this GIS certificate program include offering a course of study in applied technology designed for SMET and non-SMET students.  Participating students are learning introductory spatial analysis techniques. They also have opportunities to collaborate with faculty conducting research in using GIS.   The scientific method of inquiry is reinforced throughout the program to help students refine their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\r\n\r\nThis program was adapted and modified from several NSF-funded GIS programs at other universities, notably Northern Alabama University, SUNY-Albany and the University of Georgia, and guided by the recommendations from NSF's \"Shaping the Future\" report (NSF 96-139, 1996). By capitalizing on the strengths of other GIS programs, and incorporating recommendations from \"Shaping the Future,\" KSU is building a strong foundation and developing an innovative program tailored specifically for its student body. Although this program has moved beyond the pilot project stage, there is still a need to continually keep the curriculum current, especially in a rapidly changing technological field as GIS. \r\n\r\nThis project is refining the existing curriculum and expanding the curriculum to serve students from other departments, including chemistry, biology and marketing. This developing program is intended to serve as a local, regional and national model for other institutions planning GIS Technology programs.  \r\n\r\n",
