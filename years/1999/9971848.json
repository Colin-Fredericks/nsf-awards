 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonparametric regression analysis is a rapidly developing contemporary statistical methodology.  It avoids some of the restrictive assumptions in more classical regression approaches.  However, to date it has suffered by comparison from an almost total absence of the inferential tools (e.g. tests and confidence intervals) which help make classical regression analysis so useful.  Zhao (1998 preprint) proposed the first proper Bayesian estimator for nonparametric regression which has acceptable performance for every sample size.  The current proposal is to extend this construction in various ways and to study the inferential properties related to such Bayesian formulations.  Its various properties, including the acceptable performance of its Bayes estimator, suggest that Bayesian inference based on this prior distribution and its extensions may be feasible.  They may also present a satisfactory comprehensive set of inferential tools for nonparametric regression analysis and related formulations.\r\n\r\nRegression analysis is a classical general statistical tool, which has been widely used in virtually every area of statistical applications.  \r\nNonparametric regression analysis is a more recent methodology, which avoids some restrictive assumptions in the classical theory.  The general theory includes nonparametric formulations of regression, of density estimation, of signal processing and of spectral density estimation in time series analysis. The theory has already found significant applications in areas such as medical and environmental imaging, economic analysis, computer engineering, and geophysics.  Bayesian analysis is a very powerful general statistical methodology.  This research project proposes a possible way of using Bayesian techniques to solve nonparametric regression problems.",
