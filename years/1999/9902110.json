At least one spatial dimension of the materials system is small.  Initial efforts are directed towards understanding the effects of system size, interfacial stress, and non-local compositional stress on microstructural evolution by focussing on phase decomposition in binary and ternary (Ag-Au-Cu) alloys in small systems of spherical and planar geometry.  These results provide a foundation to investigate the effect of a diffusion barrier on the microstructural evolution of solid-state reactions.  There are three main thrust areas: (1) development of a set of thermodynamic field equations and boundary conditions for describing microstructural evolution in small systems with reactive interfaces; (2) application of the field equations and boundary conditions to simulate microstructural evolution in small systems; and (3) experimental investigation of microstructural evolution in small particles (10 - 1000 nm in diameter) of ternary Ag-au-Cu alloys using analytical transmission electron microscopy.\r\n%%%\r\nThe long-term viability of many technologically important systems depends on the microstructural stability of the materials comprising the system.  A common feature in the design of thin-film and electronic devices, composite materials, and nano-structural materials is the use of spatially contiguous phases of ever-decreasing, small spatial dimensions that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium.  There exists in these systems a strong thermodynamic driving force for interdiffusion and nucleation and growth of new phases at the interface between component materials.  These reactions can be significantly modified by the placement of a diffusion barrier between the reacting materials.\r\n***\r\n",
