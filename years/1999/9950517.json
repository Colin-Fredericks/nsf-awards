 "awd_abstract_narration": "The largest and most frequently visited Internet site for the discipline of Social Psychology is Social Psychology Network (SPN), a site founded in 1996 and maintained at Wesleyan University. SPN will be developed in six key ways: (1) a bulletin board service will be added to provide open discussion forums and links to moderated email list servers maintained by leading social psychology societies; (2) SPN will be moved from the Wesleyan University web server to its own web server; (3) the number of reciprocal links between SPN and other web sites will be increased, both to build web traffic to SPN and to connect disparate electronic resources within psychology; (4) the coverage of certain content areas within SPN will be significantly expanded; (5) the appearance and general layout of SPN will be improved with an eye toward ease of navigation as well as stability across different types of computers and web browsers; and (6) Research Randomizer, an SPN research tool for random sampling and random assignment, will be further developed and publicized. With these improvements and extensions, SPN will support teaching, training, and learning in social psychology, and it will create an infrastructure for greater networking, partnerships, access to resources, and the advancement of knowledge in psychological science. The uniform resource locator (URL) for the SPN web site is http://www.wesleyan.edu/spn.\r\n",
