 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nAlthough the investment and the interest in Intelligent Transportation Systems\r\n(ITS) is growing exponentially, robust real-time on-line traffic control\r\nstrategies that can effectively use this ITS infrastructure do not exist yet.\r\nRecent advances in the area of mathematical control theory coupled with the\r\navailability of real-time traffic data present major opportunities for the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of robust traffic responsive real-time feedback\r\ncontrol models and strategies.  This integrated research and education project\r\nhas the following objectives:\r\n1. Development of feedback based on-line traffic control strategies that can be\r\nused for real-time traffic management during recurrent and non-recurrent\r\ncongestion.\r\nPrevious research in the area of traffic control mostly focused on the use of\r\nsimulation / optimization based approaches.  However, these traditional models\r\nare not generally applicable to real-time systems due to their very high\r\ncomputational costs and robustness requirements of real-time traffic control\r\nsystems.  The use of the feedback control design methodologies that can make use\r\nof real-time data collected by traffic sensors, constitutes an exact match with\r\nthe requirements of ITS, due to the capability of feedback models to respond in\r\nreal-time to the deviations of the system from its desired behavior.\r\n2. Development of Virtual Interactive Traffic Simulation control on the Internet\r\n(VITSI) toolbox and use of real-time traffic data for laboratory testing and\r\nvalidation.\r\nVITSI toolbox will be developed using several programming languages including\r\nC/C++ and JAVA depending upon the computational requirements of the modules to\r\nbe developed.  The goal for developing VITSI is to provide researchers and\r\nstudents with a flexible and specialized traffic simulation and control design\r\ntool set they can use for the development, testing and validation of different\r\nreal-time traffic control strategies.  On-line traffic data acquired by Rutgers\r\nIntelligent Transportation (RITS) laboratory coupled with VITSI toolbox will\r\nalso be used to test and validate developed models.  This real-time traffic data\r\nwill be mainly obtained from ITS facilities in New Jersey.\r\n3. Introduction of the results of the proposed research activities into the\r\nundergraduate and graduate level traffic control courses through the use of the\r\nproposed VITSI toolbox and traffic data acquisition and processing capabilities\r\nat the recently established Rutgers Intelligent Transportation Systems (RITS)\r\nlaboratory.\r\nWith the advent of ITS, on-line traffic control design, testing, and\r\nimplementation has become one of the fast growing areas of traffic engineering.\r\nHowever, feedback control techniques have not yet been effectively introduced\r\ninto the traffic engineering education programs.  This research project will\r\ndesign an integrated interdisciplinary research-education program that will\r\nincorporate feedback control techniques into both graduate and undergraduate\r\ntraffic engineering classes.  At the heart of the education efforts, there will\r\nbe the use of VITSI toolbox concept coupled with the on-line traffic data\r\nacquisition and processing capabilities of the RITS laboratory.  VITSI toolbox\r\nwill be specifically designed to encourage the use of Internet based hands-on\r\ntools for effective teaching, learning, and research activities, and will\r\ncomplement RITS as a new research and education tool that does not currently\r\nexist.\r\n",
