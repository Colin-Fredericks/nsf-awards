This laboratory will consist of an upright confocal scanning laser microscope, an inverted microscope for micromanipulation/injection, and a computer workstation for advanced image data analysis in a mult-user, state-of-the-art facility. These light microscopes will be housed in the currently existing centralized electron microscopy laboratory, thereby creating a Centralized Laboratory for Advanced Microscopy. The light microscopes will service over 30 well established research programs in 12 departments in the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences. The users in this proposal specifically need this instrumentation for studies of fertilization, oocyte transport, angiogenesis, cell receptors, cell adhesion and dye transfer, cell junctions in neurosecretory cells, molecular motors, ion transport, plant pollination, trafficking of viral proteins in plants, and transcytosis. The equipment will allow Principle Investigators at UCR to extend their current research programsm and will enable initiation of many new projects not currently possible on the UCR campus. The light microscope laboratory has been carefully integrated and designed to be flexible, thereby meeting the broad range of needs of a core facility. The centralized laboratory where the light microscope will be housed is currently staffed by a full-time manager, and the university will provide an additional 50% Staff Research Associate for daily operation and maintainance of the light microscopes and workstation.  Training on the light microscopes will be provided in an undergraduate course in Cell Biology, a graduate level class in microscopy, and by one-on-one interaction with the Staff  Research Associate. UCR has the highest percentage of minority students of any UC campus and one of the highest nationally. Many students receiving training will be minority students.",
