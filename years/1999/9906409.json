 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the 1980s and 1990s, considerable scholarly attention has been devoted by geographers and scientists from many other fields to land-use and environmental change in sub-Saharan Africa, with special emphasis on the savanna areas that are inhabited by the majority of Africa's people.  The results of these empirical studies have challenged previous assumptions regarding population growth and environmental change, the resiliency and \"patchiness\" of savanna ecologies, and the capacity of local institutions to regulate resource use.  Population growth has been found to be only one factor influencing environmental change, with other factors like differences in natural environmental conditions, market access, social institutions, land tenure, technology, and policy also playing important roles in a complex set of processes.  This project adds to this body of knowledge through the conduct of a detailed study of demographic and environmental change in a peri-urban area of the City of Blantyre in Malawi where a fuelwood plantation was began in 1986.  The objectives of the study are fourfold.  First the study will analyze land-cover and land-use changes over a 50-year period using aerial photographs from 1948, 1968, 1982, and 1992 and satellite images from 1985 and 1995.  Second, the study will analyze population dynamics in this area, focusing on population growth, population distribution, fertility, mortality, and migration as well as on how these demographic processes have changed over time.  Third, the study will assess the impact of the city of Blantyre on environmental and demographic changes in this area through its demand for fuelwood resources, livestock, and agricultural produce.  Finally, the study will evaluate the impact of the Blantyre City Fuelwood Project on the lives of the local people in terms of land pressures, land acquisition, resource use, and employment generation and will document the views of the villagers with regard to the proposed transfer of the plantations from the government to local control.  These objectives will be achieved in a two-year study that integrates remotely sensed data with ground-based observations of land-use practices and changes and demographic and household characteristics of communities within the project area.  Using a political ecology framework, this study will evaluate the ways that the colonial context, contemporary international context, and national, regional, and local interests have all combined to create artificial land scarcities, conflict, and environmental change in an ecologically fragile and marginal area.  This research will contribute significantly to current theoretical debates on the relationship between environment, population, and other regional, national, and international factors, and it will develop mathematical models of the complex dynamics of demographic and natural environmental change in a densely settled, semi-urban area of southern Africa.\r\n",
