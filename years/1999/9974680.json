 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ciliated protozoa possess a transcriptionally inactive germline nucleus (micronucleus) and a transcriptionally active somatic nucleus (macronucleus) within the same cell. After two cells mate, a new macronucleus develops from a micronuclear fusion product in each mating partner, and the old macronucleus disintegrates. In ciliates of the hypotrich group, DNA sequences are extensively amplified, cut, spliced, eliminated, and reordered during the 60-hour development of a macronucleus.  The development of a macronucleus in hypotrichs begins with the formation of polytene chromosomes, from which tens of thousands of DNA sequences are spliced out and destroyed. Subsequently, the polytene chromosomes are transected through all interbands with elimination of more DNA sequences and release of gene-size DNA molecules, each containing a single transcription unit. Telomeres are synthesized on the ends of each of the gene-size molecules. The gene-size molecules undergo several rapid rounds of replication to produce the mature, transcriptionally active macronucleus with average gene copy numbers of ~1000. Overall, in macro-nuclear development ~95% of micronuclear DNA sequence complexity is eliminated.  Most of the eliminated micronuclear DNA consists of long spacers between successive genes or groups of genes. However, some of the eliminated DNA consists of multiple, short AT-rich sequences called internal eliminated segments (IESs) that are spliced out of genes during macronuclear development. Five of the 12 micronuclear genes that have been completely or partially characterized are scrambled; blocks of sequence called macronuclear destined segments (MDSs), which are separated by IESs, are out of order and in some instances, inverted compared to the transcriptionally functional macronuclear versions of the genes. Removal of IESs in all genes and splicing of all MDSs in scrambled and nonscrambled genes during macronuclear development requires ~200,000 recombinations in the DNA.\r\nThree strategies will be used to study evolutionary and developmental DNA events in hypotrichs. 1) Evolution of IES number, position, and structure in the four micronuclear genes encoding b telomere binding protein, a telomere binding protein, actin I and DNA polymerase a in a series of seven hypotrich species. Defining evolutionary relationships among the seven species with ssrDNA sequences will show whether IESs are lost and/or gained in which species during evolution, how IESs evolve, and how scrambling patterns evolve. The study includes mutagenesis to induce changes in micronuclear gene structure, particularly to test the mutational model of shifting of IESs along DNA. 2) The sequences of approximately 45 randomly collected clones of different macronuclear DNA molecules will be analyzed to estimate the percentage of macronuclear DNA molecules that actually encode genes. 3) The temporal order of DNA processing events will be tracked by PCR of individual anlage at known points of development.\r\n\r\nThese profound modifications of hypotrich germline DNA expand appreciation both of the extent to which DNA may be manipulated as a part of evolution and of the intricacy with which an organism is able to reconfigure its DNA sequences during development.  Insight into telomere formation may also result. \r\n",
