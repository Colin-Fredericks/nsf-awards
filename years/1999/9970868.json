These radio wavelength maps will be used to study star formation in the nearby spiral galaxies NGC 4321 and NGC 4258.  The radio maps will be synthesized from a large and unique data set of observations of these galaxies at two wavelengths.  These observations were originally made to monitor the development of recent radio supernovae (SNe). By combining these numerous observations, maps will be made that, for the first time, have sufficient resolution and sensitivity to detect a large sample of discrete radio wavelength emission sources associated with star formation in the galaxies NGC 4321 and NGC 4258. Four other nearby spiral galaxies (NGC 6946, NGC 89 1, M5 1, and M8 1) will be studied.  Radio observations are essential for understanding star formation since the radio wavelength radiation do not suffer from extinction by interstellar dust as does the optical wavelength radiation. Extragalactic observations are important since the emission from sources in our own Galaxy are severely hampered by source confusion and distance ambiguities.\r\nThe discrete sources to be studied include: 1) regions of recent star formation indicated by the presence of thermal, ionized hydrogen (HII regions); 2) supernova remnants (SNRs); and 3) possible emission from intermediate-age SNe. The six galaxies that will be studied are prime candidates for studying star formation because of their high star formation rates evidenced by recent SNe, historical SNe, and numerous, large HII region complexes. The results of the research will further our understanding of current star formation and will yield information on the distribution of initial stellar masses formed (the initial mass function), the rates and efficiencies of star formation from parent molecular clouds, and the role of SNe and SNR shock waves in promoting star formation in these galaxies.\r\n\r\nCatalogs of the properties of the detected HII regions will be compiled. Size, luminosity, and radial distribution functions will be derived, and comparisons will be made with studies at other wavelengths.  Visual extinctions will be determined from the radio and available optical maps and then compared to those deduced previously using Balmer decrements.  The radio properties of detected SNe and SNRs will be determined, and comparisons will be made with the properties of known radio SNe and SNRs.  The results of all measurements, as well as their statistics, will be compared to the data from other galaxies, and compared to measurements of Galactic sources and to predictions by current models of star formation, SNe, and SNRs.\r\n\r\nThis research will involve students at Sweet Briar College, a small undergraduate women's college, with collaborative support of personnel at the Naval Research Laboratory, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center of the California Institute of Technology.  The Division of Astronomical Sciences at the National Science Foundation provides support this award.\r\n\r\n",
