 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has as its primary aim the synthesis of organic molecules that incorporate a variety of perfluorinated groups, including pentafluorothio and perfluoroalkyl.  New and unique fluorinated photopolymerizable synthons will be used to form durable polymer films and coatings in which the fluorinated components partition to the surface of the incipient film.  This has the potential to produce polymer films in which a fluorine-enriched overlayer is incorporated into an otherwise conventional polymer.  Once prepared, systematic structure - property relationships will be determined by photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared analysis;  and refractive index, dielectric constant and surface energies will also be measured.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues support for the research of Professor Gary L. Gard of Portland State University, Portland, Oregon.  Professor Gard studies the variations in properties of fluorinated plastics as that plastic's constituent building blocks are themselves varied.  Fluorinated compounds such as those being investigated in Professor Gard's laboratory have found various applications such as solvents for polymers, perfluorinated blood substitutes, surface active agents, and as thermally and chemically stable monomers and polymers.\r\n",
