 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new memory model called Commit-Reconcile \\& Fences (CRF) is\r\npresented, and it is shown how other memory models can be described as\r\nrestricted versions of it. The CRF memory model has been designed so\r\nthat it is both easy for architects to implement, and rich enough that\r\ncompilers for high-level parallel languages can use it as a target\r\nmachine language.  This proposal is for investigating 1. the\r\nintegration of CRF into modern microprocessors, 2. adaptive protocols\r\nfor implementing CRF in Distributed Shared memory Systems (DSM) and\r\n3. efficient translation of high-level multithreaded programming\r\nmodels (e.g. Cilk) into CRF. \r\n\r\nThe impact of this research would be to eliminate a plethora of\r\nimplementation-dependent memory models, and to provide a stable\r\ninterface for architects and compiler writers. The development of\r\nmicro-architectures and cache-coherence protocols to support CRF could\r\nhave an immediate impact on industry because these changes can be\r\nincorporated in PC's and servers without the loss of software\r\ncompatibility.\r\n\r\nAnother theme in this proposal is the use of a new formal framework\r\nbased on Term Rewriting Systems (TRS) for describing computer systems.\r\nThe biggest appeal of TRS's is its naturalness for designers. The TRS\r\nframework is useful in verification of system properties.  It is also\r\npossible to synthesize hardware from TRS's.  A unified synthesis and\r\nverification framework is likely to have a big impact on current\r\ndesign practices.\r\n\r\n",
