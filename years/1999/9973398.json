 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neural networks are a class of mathematical pattern recognition techniques that have been used for image processing and spectral classification.  Built on a biological model, neural networks are claimed to mimic, in a loose sense, human thought processes.  Networks learn by example and are extremely flexible.  Because of this adaptability, networks are particularly useful for significant classes of large and complex problems, many of which cannot be solved using traditional statistical methods.  For this reason, neural networks have the potential to solve complicated problems often encountered in archaeology.  However, to date there have been no concerted efforts to explore this potential.  This research is intended to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept study for the application of neural networks to archaeological data analysis.  The research will examine issues such as data preparation, network design, and failure analysis, in order to determine how best to integrate neural networks into the archaeologists' toolbox of data-analysis techniques.  The result should be the establishment of practical guidelines that archaeologists can use to determine if neural networks are applicable to their situation and, if so, how best to utilize them.  These guidelines will be most valuable for use with large and intractable problems that are difficult or impossible to solve with existing techniques.  An example of such a complex problem is spatial analysis, in which large databases of information describing artifacts are used to evaluate and reconstruct the history of a site or group of sites.  If successful, the general approach may be useful in spatial analysis and reconstruction applications in other fields such as environmental analysis.  The research will also evaluate neural networks for their utility in archaeometry, broadly defined as the application of physical and analytical sciences to archaeology.   One example of an archaeometry question is the use of chemical compositions of artifacts to answer such questions as where the artifact was made or how old it is.  Although deceptively simple, such questions often require the analysis of large amounts of chemical information coupled to archaeological data such as where the artifact was found.  The application of neural networks in this context may even prove applicable to chemical problems beyond archaeology.  This POWRE project, in addition to exploring a novel area of research, will provide the PI with new skills in neural networks and related areas of statistical analysis as well as increase her visibility in archaeology and archaeometry.",
