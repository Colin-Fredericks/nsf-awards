 "awd_abstract_narration": "9902749\r\nSavage and Nicholson\r\n\tGraduate student Kirsten Nicholson, under the direction of Dr. Jay Savage at University of Miami and with assistance from Dr. Brian Crother at Southeastern Louisiana University, is studying the evolutionary relationships among the numerous species of the lizard genus Anolis, in particular the \"beta\" group of these animals, distributed on Cuba and Jamaica and neighboring landmasses of the Caribbean. The beta anoles exhibit a wide array of body shapes and coloration, and occur in a variety of habitats from ground level to tree canopies. About 65 representative species of the estimated 140 species in the group will be studied for DNA sequence diversity in nuclear and mitochondrial genes, and for osteological variation, in order to construct a phylogenetic framework for the group. In turn, the phylogenetic information can be used to test various theories about the biogeographic history of migration and diversification in Anolis lizards. The two major theories focus either on repeated dispersal from mainland sources to explain the numerous island species, or on the splitting of tectonic plates from mainland landmasses with subsequent speciation (or adaptive radiation) of numerous closely related forms on each major island in the Caribbean, to explain the present-day distributions and ranges of the lizards.\r\n\tPreliminary molecular and morphological study by the student suggests feasibility of the project, and numerous samples have been collected for analysis from taxa in Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, and Central and South America. Recent published work, largely emphasizing the \"alpha\" grouping of Anolis lizards, has favored the \"adaptive radiation\" scenario for island evolution of these animals. Investigators have suggested that anoles exhibit morphological adaptations (such as color, specialized foot features that grip different substrates, limbs suitable for either jumping or walking) that allowed the lizards to exploit different local habitats, such as living in the canopy, or on tree trunks, or in bushes. These different \"ecomorphs\" are often similar on each island; that is, each island has a bush morph, a canopy morph, a trunk morph, etc. The recent studies hypothesize that these ecomorphs evolved on each major island, separately from other islands but in similar manner, a scenario that discounts dispersal as a major organizing principle in island biotas. The research to be conducted by Nicholson and her mentors seeks to test these ideas for the beta anoles of the Caribbean region, with a robust phylogenetic framework for this large group.\r\n",
