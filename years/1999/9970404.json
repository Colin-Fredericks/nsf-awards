 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extremal and Probabilistic Combinatorics\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI plans to continue his work on the interplay between extremal and probabilistic combinatorics. One of the modern trends in extremal combinatorics is the study of extremal and probabilistic aspects of  general properties and large families of combinatorial structures.  The PI is one of the main advocates of this trend, and several of the  main results due to him and his collaborators. The substantial theory  that has emerged so far continues the theory started fifty years ago,  but goes way beyond the classical achievements. The aim is to determine  the fine structure of a hereditary property of graphs (or hypergraphs)  that is minimal for a given lower bound on the rate of growth. The hope  is to obtain characterizations that are precise enough to lead to good  estimates of the generalized chromatic numbers of random graphs. The  methods to be employed are an exciting blend of intricate extremal arguments and probabilistic methods based on the Erdos-Stone theorem,  variants of Ramsey's theorem, Szemeredi's regularity lemma, and  concentration of measure inequalities. The PI will collaborate with  Thomason, Brightwell, Leader, Scott, Balogh, Weinreich, and others on  the project. The PI will work on several other related projects:  with Riordan on invariants and polynomials of colored graphs and fat  graphs, with Balister and Stacey on percolation, with Arratia and Sorkin  on problems related to sequencing, and with Borgs, Chayes, Kim and Wilson on phase transitions in random combinatorial structures.\r\n\r\nThe problems to be studied by the PI are major problems of extremal  and probabilistic combinatorics. In addition to their intrinsic  significance, the problems are relevant to questions in computer science, statistical physics, and DNA sequencing.\r\n",
