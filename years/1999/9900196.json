 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crack propagation is an important failure mechanism in structural and mechanical systems requiring accurate numerical models to implement essential simulation supporting failure prediction.  The existence of system uncertainty and risk in loads, material properties, and crack size requires a reliability-based fracture-mechanics analysis to be taken into account.  The objective of this proposal is to develop a new stochastic meshless methodoloy for predicting fracture response characteristics and reliability if two-and three-dimensional structures containing crack-like defects.  This effort will be based on:  (1) well-established theories of fracture mechanics involving both linear-elastic and elastic-plastic models, (2) meshless and integrated meshless/finite element methods for determining crack-tip stress and strain fields and continuum design sensitivity analysis, (3) probabilistic models of uncertainties in loads, material properties, and crack size by random variables and random fields, and (4) stochastic meshless and simulation methods for probabilistic characterization of fracture response and reliability of cracked structures.  For the integrated meshless/finite element method, the meshless method will be used to model material behavior in areas close to cracks and the finite element method in areas further away from cracks.  Such a coupling has the potential to greatly simplify crack-growth analysis while simultaneously achieving a substantially improved level of accuracy.  The proposed research represents an innovative and timely approach to computational modeling of fracture process by meshless methods and random field theory.  The proposed meshless methods demonstrate significant potential for application in the field of probabilistic fracture mechanics.  In particular, these methods can be used for fracture control and life extension of and aging structure remains lower than the huge capital expenditures associated with designing and building a new aircraft, the life extension philosophy will continue.  However, in order to define maintenance requirements of an aging aircraft to ensure it's continued structural integrity and safety, advanced predictive tools for life and residual strength, such as the ones proposed in this study, are necessary.  This is not unique to the aerospace industry.  Identical conditions prevail in others, such as in fossil and nuclear power industries, which are also attempting to use aging power plants far beyond their intended design lives.  As such, the stochastic meshless methods proposed in this study can help solve many real-world fracture-related problems shared by aircraft, civil, nuclear, aerospace, automotive, and other industries.  To date, reliability problems involving meshless methods have yet to be solved.  The development of stochastic meshless and integrated meshless/finite element methods under this prorgram will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the field of fracture mechanics as well as address a wide range of practical engineering issues encountered in probabilistic structural mechanics.",
