One is to work on and\r\neventually prove the following conjecture of Deligne: There exists the\r\n(natural) structure of an algebra over a chain operad of the little\r\ndisks operad on the Hochschild complex of any associative algebra.\r\nThe other objective is to study holomorphic line bundles over the\r\nmoduli space of algebraic curves with a holomorphic disk and prove the\r\nanalogue of Borel-Weil-Bott Theorem for this space, considered as\r\nhomogeneous space for the Virasoro algebra.  The significance of the\r\nproject on Deligne's Conjecture consists in studying presumably deep\r\nconnections between one complex variable and associative algebras.\r\nThe proof of Deligne's Conjecture will also further simplify the proof\r\nof the existence of a deformation quantization of a Poisson manifold,\r\noriginally proved by Kontsevich and simplified by Tamarkin.  The\r\ncompletion of the Borel-Weil-Bott part of the project will establish\r\nimportant relationship between the geometry of the moduli space and\r\nthe representation theory of the Virasoro algebra.\r\n     The structure of an algebra over a chain operad indicates, usually\r\nexplicitly, the presence of a ``homotopy something'' algebra, an\r\nalgebra with certain identities, such as associativity, satisfied in\r\nonly an approximate way known as ``up to homotopy.''  Such structures\r\nhave been used by Stasheff and May in their study of loop spaces,\r\nBeilinson and Ginzburg and Hinich and Schechtman in the study of\r\ndeformation theory of algebraic varieties and vector bundles over\r\nthem, and by Kontsevich toward knot invariants.  Witten and Zwiebach\r\nhave effectively used the homotopy Lie structure in string theory.\r\nDeligne's Conjecture may be reformulated as the existence of a certain\r\nstring theory associated to every associative algebra.  Thus, the\r\nproof of the conjecture will create ground for considerable progress\r\nin studying applications of algebra to geometry and theoretical\r\nphysics.  The significance of the moduli space part of the project is\r\nin extending the fundamental relationship between the geometry of a\r\nhomogeneous space and the representation theory of a semisimple Lie\r\ngroup to the case of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces and the\r\nVirasoro algebra, respectively.  As in the classical case, the\r\ncompletion of this project would contribute mutually to the two\r\nsubjects: the geometry of the moduli space and the representation\r\ntheory of the Virasoro algebra.  Both subjects are much more\r\ncomplicated and less studied than those in the classical situation.\r\nThe project aims to advance the general understanding of each.  In\r\ngeneral, the study of the geometry and topology of moduli spaces has\r\nrecently become very important, as moduli spaces play now a\r\nsignificant role in four-dimensional topology (Donaldson and\r\nSeiberg-Witten invariants), knot theory (Vassiliev invariants),\r\nhigher-dimensional topology (Gromov-Witten invariants), and\r\ndeformation quantization (Kontsevich's quantization of Poisson\r\nmanifolds).  Moreover, although moduli spaces have been classical\r\nobjects of algebraic geometry (since the seminal work of P. Deligne\r\nand D. Mumford), their topology has not been understood yet and has\r\npresented a challenge for algebraic geometers for the last twenty\r\nyears.  Thus unraveling the topology of moduli spaces seems to be very\r\nimportant for progress in both topology and geometry.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
