 "awd_abstract_narration": "9970957\r\n\r\nThe investigator plans to continue her research in combinatorics on partially ordered sets, expanding it further in the direction of relations with algebra, topology, and geometry.  The proposed work emerges from the investigator's increased awareness of relations between her work on the lattice of noncrossing partitions and aspects of algebraic combinatorics.  Using techniques of structural and algebraic combinatorics, she considers two main lines of investigation:  determinants from combinatorial statistics on partially ordered sets and topological aspects of partially ordered sets.\r\n\r\nThis project is motivated by compelling evidence that the time is propitious for seeking a suitable unification of a number of significant independent problems.  The investigator encountered striking similarities among a number of results, proofs, and conjectures obtained by a variety of researchers working in different areas of mathematics -- low-dimensional topology, geometry, mathematical physics, combinatorics.  These constitute a critical mass of deep and diverse problems, indicating that the similarities are not mere coincidences.  Thus, and overarching goal is to make progress toward understanding the combinatorics underlying these problems and the reasons for their similarity.\r\n",
