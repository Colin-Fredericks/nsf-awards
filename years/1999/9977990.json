 "awd_abstract_narration": "The questions to be asked center on the molecular evolutionary mechanisms that create initial gene structures and control subsequent evolution.  The objectives of this research are: (1) to understand molecular evolutionary relationships among the new genes in the jgw (jinwei)-ynd(yande) gene system by characterizing their gene structures and flanking sequences in D. teisseiri, D, yakuba, and D melanogaster, using various methods of molecular analysis (2) to determine when the two mosiac genes, ynd and ymp(yellow- emperor) originated,by determining their phylogenetic distribution using molecular phylogenetic techniques  (3) to determine the roles of various evolutionary forces governing the early stages of new genes, by analyzing molecular evolution and population genetics of jgw, ynd, and ymp (4) in order to look for the correspondence between the newly evolved function and the fast sequence evolution of jgw as revealed by previous analysis of molecular population genetics, the biochemical functions of the jgw proteins at three stages: the ancestral jgw when first created, the evolved ancestral jgw before speciation, and the modern jgw genes will be investigated.  The two ancestral jgw sequences are inferred by evolutionary analysis and they will be made by site-direced mutagenesis.  \r\n\r\nThe long-term goal of this research is to elucidate how new genes with novel functions originate, a fundamentally important problem of gene evolution.  Studying the origin of a gene in detail requires the discovery of a young gene, since the early evolution of old genes has often been obscured by later evolutionary processes.  The recently identified jingwei-yande gene system in Drosophila contains several genes only 2.5 to 30 million years old jingwei (jgw) originated as an Adh retrosequence that recruited several additional exons, while yande (ynd) evolved through exon recombination with yellow-emperor (ymp).  Therefore, these young genes, with other related genes in the gene system that evolved recently in gene structure and copy number, provide an excellent opportunity to examine early processes in the origin of new genes.  \r\n",
