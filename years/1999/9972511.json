 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have implemented and adapted a cartography and visualization teaching laboratory curriculum at the Department of Geography modeled from the Virtual Geography Department at the University of Texas, Austin with exercises from Kenneth Foote's \"The Geographer's Craft\", and \"Hands-On Human impacts on Land Use/Land Cover.\"  The Cultural Geography curriculum has been revised to include the CD-based program structure of Kuby, Harner, & Gober's Human Geography in Action.   The creation of this new lab implements the transition from the map as end-product to the map as a tool for data inquiry, including exploration, interpretation, and evaluation of data through the new cartography curriculum Geographic Visualization (GVIS).  Adapting this laboratory will further four goals of the department:  1) promote the transformation of the way that cartography is taught from manual to digital methods, and from the maps as end-product to the map as a tool for exploring geographical information visually; 2) transform the geography curriculum (including our geography teacher preparation curriculum) because it provides the necessary equipment to adapt existing online geography modules in mapping and design applications in a Windows NT network promoting faculty development; 3) encourage interdisciplinary collaboration on topics in mapping and visualization with departments outside of Geography; and 4) adapt and implement presentation modes for students preparing presentations for geography courses and student conferences.  This computer lab with teaching and visualization tools at Humboldt allows us to implement and incorporate online geography modules and desktop mapping exercises into coursework and encourages interaction with other departments where mapping is central to teaching.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
