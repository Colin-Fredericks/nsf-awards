This facility  processes more than 17,000 samples per year which are submitted by the labs of some 22 faculty from 5 academic departments in the University.  Major projects using the equipment include genome mapping of fishes, population genetics of fishes and zooplankton, and cDNA sequencing of vertebrate hormones.  Additional studies are focussed on mechanisms of  signal transduction in eucaryotic cells, invertebrate models of human leukemia, development of transgenic macroalgae, identification of coral symbionts,  studies of marine invertebrate phylogeny, and sequencing of vertebrate visual pigment genes. Studies of gene structure, function, and evolution continue to drive demand for DNA sequencing in our research.  New genomic approaches are becoming increasingly prevalent in all areas of biology, and have greatly increased the need for genotyping services at our facility in recent years.  The new sequencing equipment will enhance the capability, increase the capacity, reduce the cost, and improve the reliability of sequencing services in the core facility at the University of New Hampshire. \r\n\r\n",
