 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns investigations of technology in support of problem solving environments for advanced scientific computation, based on a higher-level view of the relationship of mathematical modeling to computation.  This is based on reconsidering\r\n\r\n* Symbolic mathematical manipulation and computer algebra systems: These are tools and techniques that support problem solving, code development, comprehension, debugging and partial evaluation (the principle behind many optimization techniques).\r\n\r\n* Data modeling and the interface between numeric and symbolic computation: in particular, the use of IEEE floating-point number representations and operations, and extensions for these representations in arbitrary precision arithmetic.  For example, in a number of problems we find an emerging need to compute with approximate real numbers beyond that which is provided in hardware. How can this be done efficiently and with correct characterization of accuracy?\r\n\r\n* Exact or High-precision Computations, Series which may be in some sense be exact (coefficients) but also approximate, since they are generally truncated, used for tasks usually viewed as numerical.\r\n\r\n* The use of scripting languages: the linkage of high-performance library routines to graphical interfaces for data analysis and modeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
