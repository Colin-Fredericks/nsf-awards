A few milestones have already been agreed upon: it will provide high-speed, high quality of service (QoS) capabilities to support Intemet and intranet data applications. The main system characteristics will focus on the Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and \"turbo codes\". In 3G system, industry is primarily interested in data services that should be packet-switched with data rates of 144-384 kbps, in the outdoor environment. Data services should be asymmetric (e.g., different rates on uplink and downlink).\r\n\r\nDuring the standardization process, a few problems have emerged:\r\nThe difficulty of estimating by reliable simulations the low bit (and frame) error rates (BER,\r\nFER) - matching the required QoS with a realistic model of the multipath fading channel;\r\nThe \"error floor\" phenomenon showed by turbo codes, which might prevent from reaching\r\nBER below 10'6.\r\nThe goals of this project consist of:\r\nProposing and investigating a simple, yet realistic and flexible, channel model on which all\r\nsystem simulation will be conducted; Verifying experimentally he propagation model using an anechoic chamber recently installed at UIC and comparing the channel model with others already in use; and Setting up a virtual test bed based on very fast multiprocessor digital signal processor (DSP) boards, which will simulate the overall system with the goals of testing with fast simulation several code alternatives to achieve very low BER (10-8) and FER (< 1%).\t\r\n\r\nThe realistic channel model will be derived by extending the previous propagation prediction\r\nmodel that uses ray-tracing methods to a realistic environment in order to extract information on\r\nboth fading and time-delay for each component of the multipath. This information will be used to\r\ncompute the parameters for identifying the channel. A related activity will be the experimental f\r\nverification of the propagation model using the UIC anechoic chamber.\r\n***\t\t\r\n",
