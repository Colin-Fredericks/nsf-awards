 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9970687\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nIn this proposal, the PI considers problems in the theory of partial \r\ndifferential equations suggested by the interplay of ideas in \r\nnonlinear elasticity, image interpolation, control theory\r\nand  classical function theory.  Recent developments in image interpolation and\r\nnonlinear elasticity can be formulated as extension problems\r\nfor functions that have bounded derivatives. Typically, a function\r\nis known  only  on a  subset  of its domain of definition.\r\nThe problem is to interpolate or extend it to the whole domain\r\nmaintaining the maximum possible regularity. This extension is\r\nobtained  by solving an elliptic boundary value problem.\r\nThe solution of these problems by standard elliptic partial\r\ndifferential equations, including the Laplacian, always \r\nresults in a loss of regularity at the boundary.  \r\nTo preserve the boundedness of the derivatives it\r\nis necessary  to use nonlinear elliptic equations that are highly\r\ndegenerate, whose mathematical theory has just begun to\r\nbe understood. The prototype of these operators is the so\r\ncalled \"infinite-Laplacian\". \r\n\r\nIn many problems in physics and engineering one has to minimize\r\nthe average of  a quadratic energy. The equations so obtained\r\nare linear and are useful to describe small perturbations in\r\nmany cases. To describe large deviations, often one has to\r\nconsider nonlinear equations corresponding to non-quadratic\r\nenergies. If we try to minimize the\r\nmaximum of the energy, say to find out where   is the maximum\r\nvoltage or stress, the resulting equations are of a very\r\nnonlinear nature that requires a different mathematical\r\ntreatment than in the traditional linear theory. The PI proposes\r\nto continue the development of the basic theory of these equations.\r\nAmong the possible applications we have image interpolation,\r\none of the basic operation in image processing, and \r\nnon-linear elasticity. \r\n \r\n",
