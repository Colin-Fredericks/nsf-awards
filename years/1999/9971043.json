 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interfacial phenomena occur whenever a continuum is \r\npresent that can exist in at least two different phases \r\n(e.g. ice and water) and there is some mechanism that \r\ngenerates or enforces a spatial separation between these \r\ntwo phases (the freezing of the water). The separation \r\nboundaries are called interfaces or free boundaries. \r\nThe objective of the project is to study the time evolution \r\nof the boundaries from the following points of view: \r\n(i) generation---how interfaces emerge from an initially \r\nalmost uniform non-stable equilibrium, (ii) propagation---how \r\ninterfaces move, (iii) nucleation--how phases switch from \r\none to the other, and (iv) pattern formation--how mathematical \r\nmodels can be used to accommodate and predict commonly  \r\nobserved phase patterns such as rotating spirals, oscillating \r\nspots, expanding  rings, etc.  The project will for the most \r\npart be carried out on systems  of reaction--diffusion \r\nequations such as  activator-inhibitor  models in biology. \r\nThe main tools used are the theories of partial  differential \r\nequations and geometric measure. Experimentation through \r\ncomputer simulation will be an integral part of this \r\nproject in order to stimulate, predict, and  validate \r\ntheoretical studies.\r\n\r\nInterfacial phenomena are commonplace in physics, chemistry, \r\nmaterial science, biology, and even in mathematical finance.  \r\nIn all these areas it is important to predict, and eventually \r\nto control, the interfacial dynamics. The research performed with \r\nthis award will study mathematical model that govern these  \r\nseemingly complicated yet universal natural phenomena. \r\nThe work will also lead to the  development of new and refined \r\nmathematical theories and tools that can handle phenomena of \r\ninstability and ambiguity. Such phenomena are often observed in\r\nthese applications.\r\n",
