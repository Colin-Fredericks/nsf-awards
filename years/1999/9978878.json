The Wass MGE plan will address the national shortage, and increase levels of minority graduate student recruitment and retention, through six major strategies: 1) create a staffed administrative SME Recruitment and Retention Unit within the Graduate School; 2) identify and recruit underrepresented minority SME candidates through the use of \"Diversity Teams\" of faculty, students and alumni; partnerships with invited institutions; a summer research program and exiting campus resources; 3) change admissions criteria to reflect the balanced contribution of quantitative and non-quantitative variables; 4) develop a supportive learning environment designed to enhance academic skills, self-confidence and sense of community; 5) provide opportunities for students to become involved in an integrated program of teaching and research; and 6) offer multi-year stipend packages that support teaching and research.  All activities will be professionally evaluated.",
