McCullough\r\n\r\nAbstract: McCullough plans to investigate several related problems in functional analysis and operator theory. A common theme is the dilation of operators and the concomitant lifting of intertwining maps -- commutant lifting, as it is called -- and the special cases of interpolation of  Nevanlinna-Pick and Caratheodory type. Nevanlinna-Pick kernels, also known as NP kernels, were introduced by Agler as a natural generalization of the Szego kernel. Examples include the Dirichlet kernel, kernels nearly equal the Szego kernel on a multiply connected domain, and the kernels over the ball for Fock space. Dilation and commutant lifting results that parallel classical results hold for these kernels, including commutant lifting for bundle shifts over a two-holed domain. A number of issues for NP kernels and multiply connected domains remain unresolved. All function theoretic objects over a multiply connected domain can be described in terms of theta functions. From the trisecant identity, in combination with with knowledge of the zeros of theta functions, it follows that for any given scalar valued Nevanlinna-Pick problem over an annulus it suffices to consider just two kernels, which are explicitly determined from the data. Theta functions will be used to investigate additional problems over the annulus and more general multiply connected domains. The extremal elements (roughly what an algebraist would term projective elements) of an Agler family of operators are the natural objects to which to lift or dilate generic members of the family. Families for which the extremals are C*-closed, such as the families of contractions, isometries, and subnormal contractions, are particularly nice from a model theoretic viewpoint. This is not the case for the hyponormal contractions nor for the numerical radius contractions, where the extremals are a proper subset of the family but the C*-closure of the extremals is the entire family. A good measure of the divergence of the extremals from their C*-closure does not yet exist.\r\n\r\nA common mathematical problem that arises in physics and engineering is to determine whether certain partial information is consistent with a favorable whole. For instance, certain seismographic information indicates the presence of oil reserves, while other seismic data are not pertinent to the question. Similarly, in the design of an electrical circuit there are often several competing design criteria from which one must select the relevant ones. These problems can also be viewed as representing given information in a nice way as a part of a larger, more coherent whole. McCullough will investigate new stategies for imbedding the \"partial\" into the \"whole,\" and conduct a search for a cohesive theory unifying many different applications. This will be done in the framework of the mathematical field known as operator theory. The underlying mathematics is quite similar to that used in digital technology and automatic controlers such as autopilots.\r\n",
