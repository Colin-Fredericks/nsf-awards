 "awd_abstract_narration": "Toulouse  \r\n\r\nThis GOALI (Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry) project represents an original four-way collaboration between a focussed research group from physics, optical engineering and materials science at Lehigh in a partnership with Lucent Technologies to study optical nonlinearities in glass fibers.  Optical nonlinearities have a significant effect on the propagation of light in glass fibers.  Because fibers are usually very long, nonlinearities become cumulatively important and because the fibers usually possess a narrow core (a few microns in diameter), optical intensities in fibers are quite high.  These factors are even more true now with the development of wavelength division multiplexing in which many different wavelengths propagate simultaneously in fibers, increasing the intensities even further.  However, these nonlinearities are significant in optical fibers, not only because of their length and their core size, but also because of the microscopic structure and properties of glasses. One part of the project will concentrate on the microstructure and properties of bulk glasses and the second part on the nonlinear optical properties of bulk glasses and fibers. One of the PIs from Lucent will contribute to both experimental parts, in the synthesis of the bulk glasses, in the drawing of fibers and in the characterization of their physical properties.  The experimental results will then serve as input for the theoretical calculations and simulations that will combine them with various fiber parameters in order to predict the effect of these nonlinear optical properties on the propagation of light signal in real optical systems. These calculations and simulations will also help guide the experimental investigation.  The results of the theoretical calculations and predictions will finally be tested in collaboration with the other PI from Lucent on real optical systems. The final or feedback step of the loop will consist in a critical examination of the test results and, in consultation with all the project participants, suggestions for modification of the glasses (materials parameters) or of the fiber parameters.  The students involved in the project will spend about half their time at Lucent and thus will be exposed to the industrial research setting.\r\n%%%\r\nThe ultimate goal of this project is the control of nonlinear effects in optical systems by proper design or appropriate modifications of the structure and/or composition of glasses used to draw fibers.  These optical fibers are of increasing importance in today's information-intensive world (almost all of the traffic on the internet and world-wide-web are carried by glass fibers.)  This GOALI project is co-funded by the Ceramics and the Condensed Matter Physics Programs in the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n***\r\n",
