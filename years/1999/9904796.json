 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will define, implement and evaluate a resource that will bridge the boundary between the scientific literature and web-accessible databases of primary scientific data. The goals are: 1) to create a prototype that integrates general biomolecular information with supporting data found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), 2) to evaluate this prototype as an extensible model by which textual and graphical information in general may be linked to primary scientific data, providing a model for use in other resources and journals.\r\n\r\nThe proposed database will contain general information on a wide range of biological molecules, including information on their structure, function, and relevance to human life. The entire resource will be authored at a non-technical level, providing quick, easily-comprehensible background material for use by researchers, educators, students, and the general public. The database will allow a PDB user, when approaching a new protein, to obtain a general introduction to the structural and functional features of the molecule, from which the user may gain a deeper understanding of the context of the molecules within the PDB. Linkages to the primary data will allow users, empowered by this introductory material, to explore topics of interest in more detail.\r\n\r\nThe database will be composed of two types of information. First, the database will contain information on individual molecules, describing the structure and function of the molecule and its relevance of each molecule to human life. Links to the PDB and to other appropriate databases will suggest files that would be most appropriate for further study. Second, the database will include information on topics of interest to human life, health, and industry. These entries will refer the user to relevant molecules and to related topics.\r\n\r\nThe resource will be built upon XML (extendable markup language), allowing creation of a flexible, extensible resource. Authoring of new pages will be fast and straightforward, and an XML-based WWW interface will allow new pages to be immediately incorporated into the resource. A simple set of tags inserted into the textual material will identify topics. The WWW interface to the resource will allow searching of all avallable pages within the resource, and will use the XML tags to create links dynamically, linking appropriate pages from the entire database at the time of the search. In this way, new pages may be added at any time, and obsolete pages may be discarded without the need to resolve linkage problems.\r\n",
