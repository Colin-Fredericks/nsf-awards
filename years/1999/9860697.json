 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860697\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project presents a planar magnetic levitator/positioner for precision microelectronics manufacturing equipment applications. This technology is based on the proof-of-concept magnetic levitation stage developed by the Principal Investigator during his doctoral research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The maglev stage described in this proposal is the first to provide all the motions required for photolithography in semiconductor manufacturing with a single magnetically levitated platen. The platen is driven in all six-degree-of-freedom motions with small adjustments for focusing and alignment and large planar motions for positioning across the wafer surface. In this project, the feasibility and the performance limitation of the planar magnetic levitation technology will be investigated.\r\n     Currently, three foreign companies share 80% of the photolithography wafer stepper market. The proposed technology herein may be a corner stone for the U.S. to solidify the leadership position in the highly profitable and competitive microelectronics manufacturing capital equipment business. Besides wafer steppers, this technology can be applied to other manufacturing equipment that require precise planar position control, such as wire bonders, surface profilometers, scanned probe microscopes, and precision inspection machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
