The importance of riparian zones has been understood for some time and there has been a flurry of interest more recently that relates to land-use issues and water quality. In addition, interest in riparian zones has included biodiversity maintenance. In this project, the National Academy of Sciences will undertake the study of riparian zones to describe the nature and functioning of riparian zones and assess the condition and trends of riparian habitats with respect to their hydrological and ecological structure and functioning. The study will also review criteria for improved management and mitigation of adverse impacts and the decision-making necessary for the best use of these lands. \r\n",
