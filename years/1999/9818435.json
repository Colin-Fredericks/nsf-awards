 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motile bacteria such as Escherichia coli swim by means of multiple propeller-like appendages called flagella that are located on the bacterial cell surface. Each rotating E. coli flagellum has at its base a proton-fueled motor that operates alternately clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW). The motor's ability to switch between these two rotational states controls the cell's swimming behavior. The CW/CCW switch is comprised of three proteins: FliG, FliM and FliN. The two-hybrid system for the identification of protein-protein interactions has been successfully used to reveal direct interactions between components of the switch (FliG/FliM, FliM/FliM, FliM/FliN) and between a switch protein (FliG) and the structural protein of the motor's MS ring (FliF). Regions of proteins important for several of these interactions were identified by mutational analysis and form the basis for a molecular model for motor architecture.\r\nThe switch proteins are multifunctional: they are required for flagellar assembly, for torque generation, and for switching. They are expressed within an ordered hierarchy of flagellar genes, suggesting that they might also be involved in gene control. Novel switch protein interactions have been identified (in two-hybrid screens) that might elucidate the nature of these multiple functions: 1) the switch protein FliM interacts with a component of the cell's protein export machinery (GspE) involved in the assembly of a second class of cell surface structures, the type IV pili present in some strains of E. coli, 2) the switch protein FliG interacts with a transcription factor (H-NS) involved both in flagellum-specific gene expression and in pilus-specific gene expression. Null alleles of hns are nonflagellate, but motility (and therefore flagellation) can be restored by genetic suppression. Preliminary studies indicate that E. coli missing much of the gspE operon likewise have a motility defect that reverts readily.\r\nTo better understand the specific roles of the FliG/FliM, FliG/H-NS and the FliM/GspE interactions in E. coli flagellar biogenesis, several type of experiments will be done:  1) to verify and characterize the interactions biochemically (by co-sedimentation and affinity chromatography) and genetically (by interaction-defective mutation suppression analysis), 2) to further examine the in vivo relevance of the FliM/GspE interaction by constructing defined null alleles of gspE and assessing the effects of such nulls on flagellar assembly and function, 3) to test interaction-defective mutations in each of these interacting pairs in E. coli for their effects on flagellum assembly, for their effects on flagellum-specific gene expression when appropriate, and for pleiotropic effects when possible, 4) to characterize suppressors of the hns and gspE motility defects. Detailed studies of these and other motor protein interactions should contribute to our understanding of how structural proteins of bacterial surface organelles, such as flagella and pili, are expressed, exported and assembled, and whether proteins used for both flagellum production and pilus production serve to coordinate the two.\r\n",
