 "awd_abstract_narration": "Noise has traditionally been thought of as a \"Nuisance\" that interferes with the \"interesting\" or \"intrinsic\" behavior of physical systems.  That this limited view misses the instrumental ways in which noise can actually enhance and even cause desirable behaviors has become quite clear in the past two decades, but the ways in which this can occur are still grounds for fertile investigation.  In this project we focus on one such dramatic phenomenon, that of noise-induced phase transitions in spatially extended systems.  These are macroscopic transitions where the noise not only causes the system to go from one phase to another, but where the very existence of the phases is predicated on the presence of the noise; in its absence the system can only exist in one phase.  The investigations will attempt to systematically explore the basic features that lead to noise-induced phase transitions, the interplay of these transitions with noise-induced signal enhancement phenomena such as stochastic resonance, the control and adaptability of design parameters to produce noise-induced phases with desired properties, and the development of user-friendly interfaces that allow visualization of spatially distributed noisy nonlinear systems.",
