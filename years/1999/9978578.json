 "awd_abstract_narration": "The C.L.E. Moore Instructorship in Mathematics was created fifty years ago as an early experiment in postdoctoral training. It succeeded brilliantly and set a pattern which has been widely emulated. Indeed, the spectacular growth of research in pure and applied mathematics  in the post-sputnik era was a development in which alumni of the Moore Instructorship program played a vital role. More recently the Instructorship in Applied Mathematics has attracted a similarly talented group, and the Instructorship in Pure Mathematics, whose recipients were always comparable to the \"Moores\", and has been used to supplement fellowship funds (typically NSF fellowships), has been equally successful. Altogether there are some five hundred and forty alumni of these three programs scattered across the country (both in academic and non-academic mathematics) and involved in a very wide range of research.\r\n   \r\n   MIT will host a three day conference this October to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the Moore-Applied Instructorship. The organizers have invited ALL ex-instructors to this conference (and have asked the NSF to help defray the travel costs of younger members of this group.) Our aim is not only to celebrate the success of this program in its first fifty years of existence, but also to explore the future: Clearly the profession of research mathematics is at something of a crossroads today, and we hope to gain insight from this talented group into what directions this institution should move in the future to contribute to the continuing leadership by the US in the Mathematical Sciences.\r\n",
