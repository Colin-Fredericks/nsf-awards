 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brown and Lavrov 9972712\r\nThe phylum Arthropoda is the most speciose and arguably the most morphologically diverse within the Animal Kingdom (Metazoa).  While it is also one of the best studied, its phylogenetic position, monophyly and the relationships among and within its major lineages are still largely unresolved.  The initial rapid radiation of arthropods during the \"Cambrian explosion\" was followed by more than 500 million years of parallel evolution, often in similar environments; this makes it very difficult if not impossible to untangle arthropod relationships based on morphological characters or on DNA sequence comparisons.  However, understanding these relationships is essential if we are to interpret rather than simply describe the morphological and developmental data, and if we are to understand the processes leading to organic diversity. \r\nThe aim of this dissertation project is to resolve some of the arthropod relationships by combining a complex molecular character, the relative arrangement of genes on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with DNA and amino acid sequence comparisons.  We intend to determine complete mitochondrial DNA sequences and gene arrangements from 13 representatives of major lineages of arthropods and some related phyla and to compare them along with 10 previously published complete arthropod mtDNAs.  The comparison of mitochondrial gene arrangements has been demonstrated to be a powerful means for inferring ancient phylogenetic relationships, while DNA and amino acid sequence comparisons may add resolution when more recently diverged groups share an identical gene arrangement.  This study will also address the dynamics of mtDNA evolution, adding to our knowledge of the nature of and constraints on mitochondrial genome rearrangements.\r\n",
