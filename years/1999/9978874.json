To expand an undergraduate component to increase  the participation of UNC-CH minority undergraduate students in research with UNC-CH science and math faculty members and encourage those students to pursue graduate studies in those discipline.\r\nTo expand the summer research program to support fulltime summer research for undergraduate students, and prospective graduate students, primarily from other institutions to work with U NC-CH science and math faculty members.  \tAlthough UNC-CH has a very positive history in enrolling and graduating minority graduate students, the MGE project will serve as a catalyst to create an even more supportive culture and will: initiate support for an increased number of underrepresented graduate minority students entering science and math Ph.D. programs at UNC-CH; provide support for in-depth research experiences in the science and math for underrepresented minority undergraduate students at UNC-CH; and provide support for in-depth summer research experiences in science and math at UNC-CH for underrepresented minority undergraduate students.\r\n",
