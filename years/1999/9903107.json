 "awd_abstract_narration": "The explosive growth in demand for high-speed wireless data services \r\nhas underscored the importance of bandwidth-efficient coding and \r\nmodulation techniques for multipath radio channels. Recent \r\ninformation-theoretic results have shown that deploying multiple \r\nantennas at both the transmitter and receiver can dramatically \r\nincrease the capacity of wireless channels, without sacrificing \r\npower efficiency to the extent required by single-antenna systems. \r\nTo achieve these gains in practice requires new physical-layer \r\nsignal processing techniques (coding, modulation, decoding, \r\nequalization, and array processing) that more fully exploit \r\nthe space-time structure of the multi-input/multi-output radio channel.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop new tools for the \r\ndesign and analysis of space-time coded-modulation on multipath \r\nradio channels. Two issues are addressed. The first deals with \r\nmethods to more accurately estimate capacity and code performance \r\non channels with discrete multipath components. The second is \r\nconcerned with new parallel encoding methods for space-time \r\ncoded-modulation, which offer the performance gains of existing \r\ncodes at reduced complexity. The ultimate objective of this \r\nwork is to increase spectral efficiency and reduce power \r\nrequirements in wireless communication systems. \r\n",
