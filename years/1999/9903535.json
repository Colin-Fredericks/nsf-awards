It is aimed to study and develop ultrasonic\r\nphased array transducers most effective for assessing concrete structures and\r\ncementitious materials.\r\n\r\nDeterioration of civil infrastructure systems (CIS) has become a central issue\r\nin reference to both safety and socioeconomic concerns. Deterioration itself is\r\ninevitable, but nondestructive evaluation (NDE) may offer a solution for\r\npreventing more serious consequences by detecting damage in its earlier stage.\r\nDevelopment of reliable, expeditious and effective NDE methods facilitates\r\nearly warnings of deterioration and structural integrity. Consequently, it\r\nhelps making decision of priorities on repair, retrofitting and replacement,\r\nthus making contribution to assurance of public safety. Concrete structures are\r\nmajor building blocks of CIS. As the impact of their degradation is widely\r\nrecognized, there are growing demands for efficient condition assessment\r\ntechnology. NDE of structural concrete is a relatively undeveloped discipline\r\nas compared with that of steel and other metals. The main mode of difficulty is\r\nthe heterogeneous and attenuating nature of concrete.\r\n\r\nUltrasonic phased array systems, widely employed in the area of medical\r\ndiagnostics, provide both quantitative measurement and imaging by means of\r\nelectronic scanning of a target object with an acoustic beam. This feature\r\neliminates the need of mechanical scanning and enhances nondestructive\r\ninspection capabilities, which cannot be realized by static methods using\r\nsingle element transducers. The potential advantages of the arrays include (1)\r\nincreased maneuverability of the ultrasonic beam, (2) greater area of\r\ninsonification from a fixed position, (3) high signal-to-noise-ratio, (4)\r\nreduced inspection time and automated testing procedure, and (5) expeditious\r\nimaging capability.\r\n\r\nPhased arrays are recently extending their applications to metals and composite\r\nmaterials as well. However, these arrays cannot be utilized for concrete since\r\nthey are designed without considering relevant aspects of importance. This\r\nresearch program intends to deal with innovative low frequency phased array\r\nultrasonic sensors and their applications to cementitious materials.\r\n\r\nIt was observed from our previous study that acoustic focusing is more\r\neffective in dealing with inhomogeneous materials, and the feasibility tests\r\ndemonstrated promising results that phased arrays can be utilized for concrete\r\nif properly designed. Nevertheless, the analysis raised a potential problem of\r\nenlarged \"dead\" zone that subsequently reduces effective inspectable area. This\r\nis a serious deficiency from a practical standpoint, while our previous study\r\nsuggests an approach to resolve this challenging problem as presented in this\r\nproposal. We would like to explore the possibilities of extending the study in\r\nthe proposed program.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the proposed research is to examine the benefits and\r\nlimitations of using ultrasonic arrays for detecting cracks and other defects\r\nwithin concrete structures. For this, a threephase research plan is proposed:\r\n(1) modeling and optimization, (2) system development, and (3) implementation\r\nand performance evaluation. It is anticipated that phased arrays will offer\r\nextreme flexibility in transforming the data into useful information\r\npresentable in either quantitative forms or imaging of defects in concrete.\r\n",
