 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the continuance of a 3-year REU Site program, which is dedicated to providing students with independent research experience and promoting career development in ecology. The program uses an effective administrative protocol comprising: advertisement and recruitment; selection of diverse and productive students; advanced preparation; individual mentorship within research groups comprised of faculty, graduate students, post-doctoral associates and undergraduate students; weekly seminars and discussion groups on science, careers, graduate studies, and ethics in science; field trips to research sites and other ecological institutions; recreational opportunities; an annual student symposium; program evaluation and discussion; and follow-up including publication, professional presentation, thesis development and career tracking.\r\n\r\nThe Harvard Forest is exceptionally well equipped with field, laboratory, and housing facilities for an REU program. A mentor supervises students in their independent study and a coordinator working closely with other Harvard Forest staff, including the Director, Administrator, Forest Manager, Museum Coordinator, Computer Manager and Data Manager oversees the program. Participants are recruited nationally with a strong emphasis on geographic coverage and participation of women, minorities, and students from small colleges. Harvard University and the Harvard Forest provide strong institutional commitment and support, equivalent to 100% of the total current request, to make this program an exceptional success.\r\n",
