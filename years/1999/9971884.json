 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971884\r\n\r\nThe investigator is exploring tilings and related mathematical objects from the perspectives of combinatorics and probability theory.  In the study of tilings one examines the different ways in which a region can be built by fitting together smaller pieces (called tiles) taken from a small collection of shapes.  The combinatorial perspective focuses on the question `In how many ways can this tiling problem be solved?' while the probabilistic perspective focuses on the question `What does a typical solution to this tiling problem look like?'  In many instances these tiling models are equivalent to models studied by statistical mechanicians for decades, but the new outlook is leading to many results that the physicists missed.  The tools that are used in attacking these questions range from complex analysis and the calculus of variations to ergodic theory and interacting particle systems.\r\n\r\nOn one level, this is basic mathematical research whose main motivation (like that of most theoretical mathematics) arises from the desire to understand phenomena that are simple yet surprising, especially in cases where existing analytical tools do not make it possible to provide rigorous proofs of empirically well-founded conjectures.  A further (and potentially more applicable) motivation for this research comes from the fact that tilings are simplified models of matter, particularly of matter that incorporates randomness at the very finest levels of organization.  In many cases, the precise details of the tiling problem (the shape of the tiles and of the region to be tiled) enforce a kind of large-scale heterogeneity reminiscent of physical systems in which different phases of a substance (such as ice, liquid water, and steam) coexist.  In studying tiling models, one can prove rigorous results concerning the ways in which the boundaries between different phases are maintained thermodynamically.  Thus the study of tilings can serve as a kind of a test-bed in which some ideas about random media can be subjected to mathematical analysis.\r\n",
