These tools - a cryoultramicrotome, a cryotransfer system, and a cryogenic anticontaminator - will be used to develop and apply techniques to map water in polymer structures and to study how exposure to water affects morphology.  They will be used in an established electron-optical facility containing two modern and well equipped transmission microscopes.  Work will initially target: (i) the spatially-resolved mapping of water concentration at interfaces within fiber- reinforced epoxy-matrix composites; and (ii) the nature of scaffold degradation and tissue ingrowth in polymeric tissue-engineering scaffolds.  These tools will impact both graduate research and teaching at Stevens.  More broadly, these tools will impact a number of research groups throughout the greater metropolitan New York area, particularly in scientific and engineering efforts associated with tissue engineering, biomaterials, and pharmaceuticals. \r\n\r\nWith support from the Major Research Instrumentation program, tools for the cryogenic preparation of hydrated materials will be acquired.  These tools will be used with a transmission electron microscope to study a variety of polymeric and colloidal materials of potential technological importance.  This instrument will have an impact on the research infrastructure at Stevens Institute of Technology.\r\n",
