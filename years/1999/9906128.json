 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThere is an ever-increasing variety of procedures for managing uncertainty available. These methods are discussed in the literature of artificial intelligence, as well as in the literature of philosophy of science. Heretofore these methods have been evaluated by intuition, discussion, the general philosophical method of argument and counterexample. The present project consists of the analytical development of a test according to which these methods can be compared to each other.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty with developing such tests is that almost any method of uncertainty management will have the property that in the long run it will deliver numbers approaching the frequency of the kinds of events at issue. Thus unbiased estimates in classical statistics approach the corresponding long run frequencies and the degrees of belief of subjective Bayesians approach the same number. To find a measure that will provide a meaningful evaluation of these treatments of uncertainty, we must look, not at the long run, but at the short or intermediate run.\r\n\r\nOur project attempts to develop such a measure in terms of short or intermediate length performance. We represent the effects of practical choices by the outcomes of bets offered to agents characterized by various uncertainty management approaches.\r\n\r\nWe focus on only two treatments of uncertainty, the subjective Bayesian treatment, and the frequency-based treatment developed by the author elsewhere. A number of parameters are identified that affect the results of this test, and their importance and effect will be examined. It is hoped that the general approach will prove applicable to the test of other approaches than these two.\r\n",
