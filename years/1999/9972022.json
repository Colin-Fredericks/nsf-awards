 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972022\r\nSpiegel\r\n\r\nIn this project we shall study three kinds of parametrically driven systems: \r\n(1) a periodically driven, ordinary differential equation, (2) the partial \r\ndifferential equations of thermal convection with time-dependent \r\nboundary conditions and (3) maps of the line with time-dependent control \r\nparameters. The aim of this work is to gain insight into the ways that \r\nenvironmental variations complicate the behavior of natural systems.  In \r\nthe case of the ODE, we shall consider a periodically driven nonlinear \r\noscillator that exhibits chaos.  We aim to develop the equivalent of the \r\nShil'nikov theory for such nonautonomous equations.  The absence of \r\nfixed points of the implied flow presents interesting difficulties for this \r\napproach.  To investigate the convection equations with time-dependent \r\nboundary temperatures, we shall use a modal expansion procedure that \r\nallows careful accounting of the vertical structure of the problem and we \r\nshall check our results against direct numerical simulation.  This \r\nprocedure will allow us to include complicating effects like rotation.  Our \r\nexploration of nonautonomous maps will focus on the nature of the \r\nintermittency that they can exhibit.  In such systems the basin boundaries \r\nmay become riddled and we shall compare the onset of this phenomenon \r\nto the analogous case without dissipation when cantori form.\r\n\r\nThe simplest chaotic systems do the same things over and over again but \r\nnever the same way twice.  Details of their behavior can easily be \r\nmodified by external perturbations, no matter how small.  However, when \r\nthe external perturbations are persistent, they can cause the disturbed \r\nsystems to switch their overall behavior patterns dramatically, as \r\nillustrated by the famous water-drop torture.   Weak but chaotic forcing \r\ncan lead to erratic outbursts of activity punctuated by calm periods in a \r\nprocess known as on-off intermittency.  The minima in solar activity that \r\noccur every few centuries and last for decades illustrate this behavior. We \r\nwish to gain insight into how responses to persistent external perturbations \r\nvary according to whether the perturbations are regular or irregular in \r\ntime.  We know already that simple models of the earth's climate, when \r\nsubjected to the effect of continued slight fluctuations in solar output can \r\nshow swings in global conditions.  We aim to deepen our mathematical \r\nunderstanding of such effects through the study of tractable models of \r\nperturbed chaotic systems.  The results from such studies may provide \r\nguidance for large-scale numerical modeling of complex phenomena such \r\nas climate variations and population dynamics.\r\n",
