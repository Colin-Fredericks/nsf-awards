Major topics to be addressed include the potential for contributions by environmental engineers toward achievement of a sustainable environment, applicability of advances in molecular level procedures in the biological and chemical sciences that can be applied toward addressing significant environmental problems at scales ranging from global/continental to meso/microcosmal.  A final workshop topic will address advances in process technologies that can be applied to address restoration and maintenance of acceptable levels of environmental quality.  The product of this conference is expected to be used in guiding the conduct of the Environmental Engineering and the Environmental Technology elements of the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program in the Engineering Directorate's Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems.  Results are also expected to assist in advancing the National Science Foundation's commitment to the core strategy of integrating research and education as articulated in its stragetic plan. ***",
