 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the measurement of tropospheric mixing ratios of hydrogen peroxide, H202, methylhydroperoxide, CH3OOH, and other organic hydroperoxides, e.g., CH3C(O)OOH, CH3CH2OOH, HOCH2OOH, on board the NCAR C-130 aircraft during the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox experiment (TOPSE). TOPSE is a multi-investigator, multi-institutional program designed to study the springtime photochemistry of ozone and other contaminant compounds over the mid-latitude to polar Northern Hemisphere during the transition from winter to spring conditions.  Hydrogen peroxide is a direct product of perhydroxyl radicals and the organic hydroperoxides are intermediates in the oxidation of most hydrocarbons, as well as, being products of organic peroxyl and perhydroxyl radicals.  It is the peroxyl radicals, as well as, nitric oxide which are necessary for new ozone production.  The hydroperoxides will be measured in situ using an established airborne methodology involving aqueous collection of the gaseous hydroperoxides followed by HPLC separation and fluorescence detection of a hydroperoxide derivative.  The TOPSE airborne hydroperoxide measurements will provide a unique set of distribution measurements for this region and time of year and are desirable for comparison with the results of developing global 3-dimensional coupled dynamic and photochemical models.\r\n\r\n",
