One component of the project\r\ninvolves consideration of the semisimplicity of representations of FG,\r\nwhere G is an arbitrary group.  Under suitable constraints on a\r\nrepresentation, (e.g. requirements that the dimension not be too large\r\nwith respect to p) recent results permit one to deduce\r\nsemisimplicity. Along these lines, the project will study the\r\nsemisimplicity of certain tensor operations (generalizing the tensor\r\npower, exterior power, and symmetric power) applied to appropriately\r\nconstrained semisimple representations, as well as certain \"converse\r\ntheorems.\"  When H is the finite group of rational points of a\r\nsemisimple algebraic group G over a finite field, the project will seek\r\nto obtain vanishing results for cohomology groups of H with\r\ncoefficients in irreducible FH-modules whose dimension is suitably\r\nbounded in terms of p; such vanishing results for first cohomology\r\nfollow from some known semisimplicity results.  The project will\r\nextend some investigations of the author concerning H. H. Andersen's\r\ntilting module filtrations; one aim is to obtain Andersen's sum\r\nformula for all primes p in the setting of \"Howe dual pairs.\"\r\nAnalogies between various sum formulae -- the classical result of\r\nJantzen, the recent work of Andersen, and some recent work of Jantzen\r\non non-restricted representations of the Lie algebra of G -- will be\r\nconsidered. Some explicit constructions of irreducible representations\r\nfor double covering groups of symmetric groups will be sought; by\r\nanalogy to the familiar interplay between the general linear group and\r\nthe symmetric group, it is hoped that the simple algebraic Spin group\r\ncan be exploited to obtain some insight for the desired constructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
