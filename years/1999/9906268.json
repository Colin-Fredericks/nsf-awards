The purpose is to determine the potential for dispersed-phase martensitic transformation toughening as a means for achieving the high fracture toughness levels necessary to make the subject alloys commercially viable.  Since KIC values close to that needed have already been reported for the lamellar gamma-TiA1+ alpha2-Ti3A1, the beta-phase induced toughness enhancements presented above suggest that achievement of the required fracture toughness levels is feasible.  Finite element modeling of the fracture process is carried out to determine how the alloy should be designed in  order to take full advantage of crack shielding and crack-face bridging.  Toward that end, crystal-plasticity constitutive relations for the lamellar gamma-TiAl + alpha2-Ti3Al alloys containing second-phase particles of the beta-phase are developed, and the particle/matrix interfacial potentials determined by combining high resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis of interface orientations with atomistic simulations of the interface decohesion.  Finally, to account for inelastic deformation due to the change in crystal structure and for lattice rotation accompanying the \"beta to alpha\" martensitic transformation, a crystal-plasticity model for stress-assisted martensitic transformation is developed and used in modeling the interactions between dispersed-phase martensitic transformation and fracture.\t\r\n%%%\r\nDue to their unique combination of mechanical, physical and chemical properties, alloys based on gamma-TiAl + alpha2-Ti3Al are of great technological importance for applications in high-temperature propulsion systems.  However wide scale application of these alloys is currently hampered by a lack of room-temperature tensile ductility and fracture toughness.  \r\n***\r\n",
