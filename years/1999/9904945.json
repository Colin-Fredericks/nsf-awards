 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation's Innovation and Organizational Change Program, this research is the first phase of a larger effort to understand the dynamics of firm entry, survival, growth, and exit in the US economy. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been the focus of considerable policy attention in the United States and other western nations. A substantial amount of resources are devoted annually to a range of programs aimed at nurturing and supporting the creation and growth of SMEs. \r\nThe objective for the pilot phase of proposed research is to determine: (1) How easy is it for firms to grow? and (2) Is small size at entry a trap?  \r\nThe pilot study examines the employment history of a single cohort of firms from birth to maturity. Firms are classified into size categories at birth and, if they have survived, at subsequent age intervals. A matrix for different classes of firms is constructed and the dynamic properties of small firms' importance to the economy evaluated to provide a more insightful basis for more informed public policy decisions. \r\nThe primary source of data is a US Longitudinal Database, analogous to the Longitudinal Database for Canada that contains employment information on first that operate in the US during the period 1989 to 1995. the development of this database will allow american and Canadian researchers to do comparative studies that will be of interest to policy makers on both sides of the border. The US findings will be compared to the results of recent research on Canadian data which has refuted the \"engine of growth\" hypothesis regarding small firms. The pilot study is co-sponsored by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.\r\n",
