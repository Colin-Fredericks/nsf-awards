 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nCTS-9904139\r\nS. Loyalka\r\nU. of  Missouri @ Columbia\r\n\r\nA comprehensive three-year theoretical study is proposed to investigate the role of variable surface conditions in the condensation/evaporation and reaction of vapors and gases on arbitrarily shaped, heterogeneous aerosol particles that may or may not be wetted.  We will consider one or more particles of arbitrary shape and size situated in an infinite expanse of a gas-vapor mixture in which diffusing vapor molecules are present in small amounts.  The particle surface conditions will be allowed to be compositionally and/or chemically heterogeneous to correspond to various natural and anthropogenic particles.  Also to be considered and particles that are wetted, e.g. Hygroscopic particles that ultimately acquire shapes dictated by surface tension effects.  For the continuum and jump regimes, we will use a Green's function technique to convert the Laplace equation together with its boundary conditions into a boundary integral equation.  This allows the reduction of the 3-D Laplace equation to a 2-D integral equation and thus easier handling of the surface morphology and adsorption properties.  The integral equation will then be discretized, and a generalized computer program will be developed to obtain local and global condensation (or evaporation) rates.  For the transition regime, in which some particle dimension is comparable to the vapor molecular mean free path, we will obtain solutions of the linear Boltzmann equation.   We will explore applications of boundary fitted coordinate techniques as well as multigrid methods in conjunction with our previous work on spherical particles.  The shapes of complex wetted agglomerates will be obtained by solving the Young-Laplace equation with the associated free boundary conditions that involve the wetting angles at the contact points.  We will use differential geometry to characterize arbitrary surfaces, and a combination of finite differencing and Newton's method to solve for the shapes of liquid surfaces.  This research will result in the development of general and versatile mathematical and numerical frameworks for the determination of local and global condensation rates.  Specifically, new understanding of the dependence of rate expressions for the growth of wetted particles, chain-like agglomerates, and bio-aerosols on surface heterogeneities will become available.  These rate expressions will find use in computer codes for the modeling of various natural and engineered processes (e.g., programs for assessing or predicting air quality, global warming trends, optimal catalyst surfaces, etc.).  Fine particles are a high priority issue in the area of air quality risk assessment as well as with respect to global warming issues.  The present research will permit more realistic estimations of  these risks and will aid in improving particle synthesis and manufacturing techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
