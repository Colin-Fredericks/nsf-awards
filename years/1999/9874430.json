 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed research is to elucidate the mechanisms\r\nregulating the development of the appressorium, a specialized cell required\r\nby the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea (and other fungal pathogens)\r\nfor successful host infection.  Previous research focused on characterizing\r\nand cloning genes from appressorium developmental mutants. These data have\r\nbeen used to create a model of appressorium formation for further testing.\r\nIn this project, advantage will be taken of progress to date as well as new\r\nresources available at the Clemson University Genomics Institute.  It is\r\nnow possible to analyze the expression of many genes under a variety of\r\ndevelopmental conditions.  As many of those genes involved in appressorium\r\nformation as possible will be identified through differential hybridization\r\nanalysis.  Gene expression in various appressorium deficient mutants will\r\nbe exploited to identify potentially key genes.  The function of these\r\ngenes will be investigated by gene disruption.  Finally, to begin to define\r\nthe interplay of proteins regulating appressorium formation the interaction\r\nof gene products will be evaluated. \r\n\r\nObjectives include:\r\n1. Identify genes involved in the regulation and development of\r\nappressorium formation.  This objective covers the completion of ongoing\r\nresearch, specifically APP1 cloning and identifying genes tagged by\r\ninsertional mutagenesis.  In new research, genes involved in appressorium\r\nformation will be identified by differential hybridization of cDNA\r\nlibraries arrayed on high-density filters.  Identified cDNAs will be\r\nsequenced and deposited in public databases.\r\n2. Evaluate role of appressorium genes through gene disruption.\r\n3. Begin to define the regulatory networks governing appressorium formation\r\nby exploiting the 2-hybrid system.\r\n\r\nResults from this investigation have practical as well as conceptual\r\nsignificance.  The identification of genes and pathways essential for\r\ninfection to occur can be exploited to create rational mechanism based\r\ninhibitors.  \r\n\r\n",
