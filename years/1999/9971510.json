Some of these involve the categorical\r\nunderpinnings of state-sum techniques: the investigation of the algebraic\r\nstructure of TQFT's, of the deformation theory of categories with\r\nstructure, and the categorical underpinnings of ``state-integrals,'' i.e.,\r\nmeasure theoretic analogues of the familiar state-sums.  Others aim at\r\napplications of the techniques to topology and quantum gravity: the\r\nextension to the Minkowskian signature of the Barrett-Crane state-sum\r\nformulation of Euclidean quantum gravity, the investigation and\r\nconstruction of topological invariants related to the Barrett-Crane and\r\nCrane-Yetter state-sums and their generalizations, and the investigation\r\nof the relations between categorical deformation theory and the theory\r\nof Vassiliev knot and link invariants.\t           \r\n     This project seeks to investigate the structure of 3- and\r\n4-dimensional spaces, both the abstract spaces of topology, and the\r\nstructure of physical space-times in certain proposed models for a\r\nquantum theory of gravity.  The problem of quantizing gravity is probably\r\nthe deepest unsolved theoretical problem in physics.  It points to the\r\nmost fundamental unknowns in our understanding of the universe, such as\r\nthe origin of the universe and black hole physics.  Its apparent\r\nintractability by using traditional methods suggests that a radically new\r\ntype of mathematics may be necessary to solve the problem.  The structure\r\nof operators on spaces of quantum states, the algebraic structures\r\ndescribing the assembly of spaces or knots and links from simple pieces,\r\nand the algebraic data needed to construct state-sums with suitable\r\ninvariance properties to investigate both topological structures and to\r\nconstruct ``spin-foam'' models of quantum gravity, can all conveniently be\r\ndescribed in terms of generalizations and extensions of the theory of\r\nmonoidal categories first introduced by MacLane in the early 1960's.\r\nThese facts, together with recent progress with the interrelated problems\r\nmentioned above, lead to the hope that the theory of monoidal categories\r\nmay be the missing tool.  Thus, much of the work uses category theory,\r\nnot as a substitute for set theory as a foundations of mathematics, but\r\nas the appropriate sort of algebra for the investigation of spaces\r\nabstracted from the one in which we live.\r\n*** \r\n",
