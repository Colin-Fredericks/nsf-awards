K.\r\nIowa State U.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests (support for a planning visit as part of a potential tri-national collaborative effort between the principal investigator (PI) Dr. (Surya) Mallapragada at Iowa State University (USA), Dr. Sacide Alsoy at Izmir Institute of Technology (Turkey) and Dr. Joseph Miltz at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology (Israel), devoted to investigating the multicomponent drying mechanism of semicrystalline polymer packaging materials.  The idea for this collaborative was born during Tri-National US-Israel-Turkey sponsored by the National Science Foundation and held in Haifa, Israel (in March 1999).  Solvent removal is a key-processing step in the case of packaging materials, many in which are made from semicrystalline polymers.  Therefore, understanding the mechanism of this process has a significant impact on industrial drying processes.  The expertise of the three investigators perfectly complement each other for this industrially and fundamental important problem in polymer science.  A two pronged approach will be used to deal with the problem of multicomponent drying of semicrystalline polymers in the context of food packaging applications.  Experimental approaches to investigate the effect of drying conditions on the final product will be complemented with mathematical modeling to enable optimization of drying conditions and dryer designs.  The three investigators have had an opportunity to interact in Israel and tour the facilities available.  However, important details still need to be resolved and the investigators would benefit greatly from inspecting the other project sites as well.  Therefore, support is requested from NSF to enable the PI to visit the facilities available in Turkey and work out the details to enable a collaborative research proposal to be submitted by the three investigators.       \r\n",
