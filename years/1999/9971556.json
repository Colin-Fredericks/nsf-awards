Its principal goal is the investigation of the dynamical and geometric structures of \"higher rank\" systems.  Such systems naturally appear both in dynamical systems and geometry.  In particular, the investigator will study rigidity properties of hyperbolic actions of higher rank abelian and semisimple Lie groups and their lattices with the ultimate goal of classifying such systems.  The investigator also plans to investigate Riemannian manifolds (especially higher rank ones) and their geodesic flows.  Geometric, dynamical and group theoretic tools will be used in this research.\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively new fields that investigate the evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in a fluid flow).  New ideas and concepts from dynamics (e.g. chaos, fractals) have changed our perception of the world fundamentally.  Dynamics and ergodic theory provide the mathematical tools and analysis for these investigations. Dynamical systems have had a major impact on the sciences and engineering.  Symbolic dynamics for instance has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe codes for computer science.  Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as far afield as cell biology and meteorology.  Geometry is one of the oldest fields in mathematics, and generally studies curves, surfaces and their higher dimensional analogues, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such spaces.  Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now studied for aesthetic reasons and its close ties with physics and other sciences and applied areas (computer vision e.g.).  Geometry and dynamics are closely related as some important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and geometry also provides tools to study dynamical systems.  The main goal of this project studies when two dynamical systems commute, i.e. when one system is unaffected by the changes brought on by the other. Important examples of such systems arise from geometry. \r\n",
