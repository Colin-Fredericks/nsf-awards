 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed program is to encourage the participation of physics undergraduate and first-year graduate students at the American Physical Society (APS) Centennial meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, March 20-26, 1999.  Physics Departments throughout the nation will be notified that $250 matching grants are available to support the travel and subsistence of students selected to attend and participate in the Centennial Celebration.  It is hoped that with the appropriate funding approximately 320 undergraduate and first-year graduate students would be able to attend and benefit from this unique meeting.  The APS expects that this opportunity will give talented students the chance to experience their chosen field of study in a different setting and to meet distinguished and eminent leaders in physics.  This activity is jointly supported by the Divisions of Physics (PHY), Materials Research (DMR), Undergraduate Education (DUE), and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).",
