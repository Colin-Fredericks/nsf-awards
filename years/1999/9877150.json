 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central theme of this research is the computational complexity of Boolean circuits.  This fundamental model of computation is studied both as a model of parallel computation and for its connections to the most important questions of complexity theory, such as the P vs. NP question.\r\n\r\nIn the last fifteen years, a lot of effort has been devoted to the study of small-depth Boolean circuits.  While many important results have been obtained and many powerful techniques discovered, the computational power of some classes of small-depth Boolean circuits is still greatly misunderstood.  The main goal of the first part of this project is to investigate some of these circuit classes, especially those related to depth-three threshold circuits and depth-three circuits with modular gates.  The intention is to prove new lower bound results, extending the range of complexity classes that can be separated from NP.  The intention to prove both lower bounds and upper bounds that will help determine the exact computational power of some of these circuit classes.  \r\n\r\nThe second part of this project will focus on the close connections between circuit complexity and relativized computation.  Circuit lower bounds have typically been used to obtain oracle separations.  The intentions to show that exponential circuit lower bounds imply in fact a pair of oracle collapses, which in turn imply a separation.  This research will illuminate the intimate connection between upper and lower bounds in complexity theory and will also shake up the faith in oracles as providing circumstantial evidence about the real world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
