 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Dr. Vincent P. Conticello at Emory University is supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division. The focus of the research is the design, biosynthesis and characterization of polypeptide block copolymers that are capable of self-assembly into well-defined nanostructures.  Initial targets will be based on the structural model of spider dragline silk, which is organized into distinct rigid and flexible domains, accounting for its unusual combination of high compressive and tensile strength. Specific elements of the research will be design and evaluation of spider silk analogs using molecular modeling techniques, biosynthesis of candidate proteins using recombinant DNA techniques, and characterization of the structure and self-assembly of the synthetic block co-polypeptides in both solution and the solid state. By using the principles of protein structure and concepts of polymer materials science, non-natural protein-based materials will be prepared with properties that emulate or exceed natural materials.\r\n\r\nThe teaching component of the CAREER award will parallel the establishment of a new Department of Physical, Materials and Computational Science.  Core curricula based on interdisciplinary graduate courses in Biotechnology and Chemistry and Chemistry of Materials will be developed. Included will be advisor/advisee programs for new students, development of a web-based undergraduate inorganic chemistry course, and establishment of Freshmen seminars in Materials Chemistry.\r\n",
