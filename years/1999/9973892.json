 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasticity, the property of the brain that allows it to constantly adapt to change, is a prominent feature of brain development as well as learning and memory in the adult.  Learning and memory is only a specific case of the brain's ability to modify connections in response to altered input.  Connections between neurons (synapses) that are used often become stronger, while those that are unstimulated gradually dwindle away.  How does activity modify a synapse to make it \"strong\"? Neuronal activity induces expression of specific plasticity genes whose protein products then bring about molecular changes in the neurons, strengthening their response to a given stimulus.  One approach to understanding the cellular mechanisms of activity dependent synaptic plasticity is to identify and characterize participating genes and their proteins' functions.\r\n\r\nThis POWRE proposal addresses the functional characterization of one plasticity gene that was previously isolated by Dr. Nedivi: cpg15.  Virally mediated gene transfer will be used to overexpress cpg15 in the cerebral cortex, and the effect on synaptic strength will be assayed several days later by electrophysiological recording.  Manipulating gene expression in vivo and examining the ensuing changes that occur in a functional cortical circuit can help elucidate how a specific gene, like cpg15, may participate in the synaptic events that lead to cortical plasticity.  The experiments in this POWRE project will add an electrophysiological dimension to Dr. Nedivi's study of synaptic plasticity, which until now only included molecular biology and imaging technologies.  Such a cross-disciplinary approach is absolutely necessary for integrating information obtained by different disciplines of neurobiology into a unified view of the molecular mechanisms underlying brain plasticity.\r\n\r\n   \r\n",
