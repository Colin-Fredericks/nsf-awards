 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the cortical systems that support semantic memory, the human ability to retrieve long-term knowledge in a selective manner.  Recent advances in brain imaging have provided a noninvasive method for studying cognitive processes, including semantic memory, in healthy volunteers.  These advanced methods, known collectively as functional neuroimaging, have identified prefrontal cortex as the region of the brain that may be specialized for the retrieval of knowledge from semantic memory.  This project is based on the hypothesis that prefrontal cortex is involved in the selection of information among competing alternatives and not in retrieval of information from semantic memory, per se.  According to this selection hypothesis, which was based on an analysis of the literature and on some preliminary findings, prefrontal cortex acts as a dynamic filter that biases the retrieval of relevant information, when needed, from other parts of the brain.  Some of the experiments will test this hypothesis in patients with focal brain damage, in order to allow inferences to be drawn about the necessity of prefrontal cortex for normal retrieval of semantic information.  The first goal of this project will be to establish a database of patients who have been identified on the basis of neuroanatomical criteria, in order to characterize brain-behavior relations by studying patients with relatively focal lesions. The database will contain both a precise anatomical description of the lesion, based on an MRI scan, and the results of a comprehensive behavioral neurological mental-status exam designed to assess a variety of cognitive capacities. This important database of focal brain lesions may prove extremely useful in the current and in future neuropsychological studies.  The second goal of this project will be to test hypotheses concerning the role of prefrontal cortex in semantic memory.  These experiments will examine the effects of competition on the ability of patients with prefrontal damage to retrieve information from semantic memory.  In addition, these studies will extend the selection hypothesis to a different kind of memory, short-term, or working memory, in order to examine the homogeneity of prefrontal function (or alternatively, its functional-anatomical specialization) across a wider range of domains.  These studies will challenge newly developed claims about the role of prefrontal cortex in semantic memory and will exemplify the way in which functional neuroimaging and more traditional neuropsychological methods can be integrated to provide converging evidence about brain-behavior relationships. This POWRE award will significantly enhance the career development of this promising young investigator at a pivotal career junction, as she makes the transition to a tenure-track faculty member and independent scientist and will contribute to her increased visibility in the research community and to her subsequent academic advancement in her field.",
