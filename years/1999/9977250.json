The knowledge of these genes and their sequences has made it possible to undertake genome-wide analyses of gene expression and regulation, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, transcriptional profiling in toxicology, and in drug discovery.  Many of these advances have been made feasible by DNA microarray technology in which collections of DNAs of interest are arrayed on small slides or filters.  These arrays are hybridized to fluorescently-labeled DNA or RNA probes and the signals scanned and analyzed using sophisticated microarray scanners and software packages.  This project involves the acquisition, and use of a 768 well thermal cycler for generation of DNA samples to be arrayed; a microarrayer for generation of DNA arrays; a scanner for quantitation of the hybridization signals; software for the analysis of data; and technical support for the operation of the machines.  Projects to utilize this instrumentation include studies of the regulation of polarity and the actin cytoskeleton in early C. Elegans development; identification of Toll pathway components; peroxisome biogenesis and degradation in Pichia pastoris; identification of forespore-expressed genes required for engulfment during Bacillus subtilis sporulation; and other projects being developed by both major and minor users.",
