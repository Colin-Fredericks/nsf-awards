 "awd_abstract_narration": "9900464\r\nIoannou\r\nThe proposed research integrates five major subtasks, designed to conduct a comprehensive investigation of design tradeoffs between performance and reliability of state of the art n- and p-channeI SOT MOSFET's. Experimental studies will be done on samples provided by Honeywell, Motorola, and Naval Research Laboratory, and simulations with the SILVACO package. Two Ph.D. students will work in this program under the supervision of the P1.\r\n(a)\tThe recent discovery and understanding of the opposite channel based injection (OCBI) phenomenon, under our previous NSF grant, places us in a unique position to answer an important remaining question regarding the value of the exponent n, of the interface generation power law Dit(t) = Atn. Specifically, we have established with the help of OCBI that unipolar injection leads to n=O.25 and bipolar to n=0.5. We now propose to examine if this is due to the absence or presence of a coulombic barrier, or it is a result of different electrochemical reactions.\r\n(b)\tBulk BC PMOSFETs are cheaper to fabricate (single poly) and have better performance, but suffer from DIBL effects and increased hot carrier degradation compared to SC PMOSFETs. We propose to conduct a comparative study of these tradeoffs for S0I PMOSFETs.\r\n(c)\tNarrow channel bulk MOSFETs suffer from higher hot carrier degradation than wide channel ones, but several labs (including ours) have observed that the opposite is true for SOI. We propose to examine why, and suggest suitable process improvements.\r\n(d)\tWe propose to conduct an extensive study of the hot carrier reliability of 0.18 and 0.10 micron S0I MOSFETs, bearing in mind that in the case of bulk devices the worst case stress condition as the channel shrinks are reported to be different from the long channel case.\r\n\t(e)The dual-gate S0I MOSFET, where the channel region is independently controlled by self-aligned top and bottom gates, has been singled out in the NTRS report as holding much promise for future scaling down to 10 nm. Because of the structural form of this device, OCBI is expected to be stronger and more complicated than in more conventional S0I structures, with important implications both for reliability and possible device applications. We therefore propose to carry out a comprehensive study of the OCBI phenomenon in the dual-gate SOI MOSFET.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
