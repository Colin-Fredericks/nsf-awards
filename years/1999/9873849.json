Liquid crystals are fascinating materials with properties intermediate between those of solids and liquids.  They are important for technological applications such as display devices, and layered liquid crystalline structures are relevant to biological research on lipid bilayers.  An outstanding question in liquid crystal research is how molecular structure influences observed macroscopic behavior.  While there are empirical rules underlying this connection, there is limited fundamental understanding.  This research attempts to improve our understanding through numerical simulations.\r\n\r\nLarge-scale numerical simulations of a variety of models of liquid crystals will be carried out.  The models to be developed and used in this work are phenomenological in nature, i.e., they do not include atomic-level detail, but do include the essential molecular features such as shape, electric multipole moments, and the relative strengths of attractive and repulsive intermolecular interactions.  By considering phenomenological as opposed to atomistic models, larger systems can be simulated.  A variety of physical phenomena will be studied including: flexoelectricity (the electrical response of a liquid crystal to an orientational deformation), the formation of chiral liquid crystal phases from achiral moelcules, the mechanism underlying molecular tilt in smectic phases, the properties of topological defects in nematics, and the properties of confined nematics.  Simulation techniques will include molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo algorithms.  The simulations will be carried out on workstations and massively parallel Cray computers located at the San Diego Supercomputing Center.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research is aimed at understanding the properties of liquid crystals.  Liquid crystals are fascinating materials which are intermediate between solids and liquids, that is, they have properties of each.  Liquid crystals are commonly used for display purposes in watches and computer screens.  Many biological systems are in a liquid crystal state. This project uses state of the art computers to simulate the behavior of various types of liquid crystals.   Besides providing a deeper understanding of liquid crystals, the results should be of great interest for applications.  This group has a unique capability for simulating these complex systems. \r\n***\r\n",
