 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many physics instructors and potential employers agree that the most valuable aspect of an effective physics course is the development of versatile and robust quantitative problem solving skills in our students.  Significant gains have been made in our ability to teach introductory physics courses in such a way that students gain a deep conceptual understanding of the material.  Quantitative assessment tools like the Force Concept Inventory and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation, which measure the increase in student conceptual understanding resulting from instruction, have been instrumental in motivating and guiding curricular reform along these lines.  To make similar gains in our ability to teach quantitative problem solving skills,  a valid assessment instrument that can identify the effective pedagogical techniques for problem solving skill development in our students needs to be developed. This project focuses on the development and preliminary validation of a quantitative assessment tool to measure problem solving ability.  The tool is based on a guided interview protocol in which students are asked to solve a realistic, novel and quantitative problem.  The student's responses during the guided interview are numerically evaluated based on: whether the action or response is independently generated rather than provided in response to prompting by the interviewer, correctness, and potential to result in the solution of the problem.   Comparison of  the score assigned to a given student by the tool and the student's instructor's evaluation of the student's performance on quantitative problem solving tasks provides the mechanism for preliminary evaluation.  With an appropriate, reliable and valid tool,  comparisons regarding the effectiveness of instructional techniques can be made. Comparing curricula and pedagogies is imperative if we are to realize the same improvement in teaching for robust problem solving ability as we have seen in the area of conceptual learning.",
