 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this 2-year project is to improve student learning of physics at Jefferson Community College by implementing active learning through microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL) and interactive lecture demonstrations (ILDs) in all physics and physical science courses.  The use of MBL and ILDs has dramatically improved students conceptual understanding at colleges that have implemented this type of technology as shown by the research of P. Laws, D. Sokoloff and R. Thornton.  A small pilot MBL class of introductory physics, team-taught by the PI and another instructor in spring of 1999 using the RealTime Physics curriculum (Mechanics) without adaptation, confirmed that students using MBL had higher scores on posttests than traditional lecture course students.  Other results of the pilot study indicated that the students had trouble staying on task during 2-hour lab periods.  To adapt and implement the RealTime Physics curriculum to better suit the student population at our institution, the MBL activities are modified into shorter tasks, with both small group work (2-3 students) and larger group work (entire class) with coaching from the instructor and integrating ILDs in the course.  The project includes adapting and implementing the MBL and ILDs currently in use and developing new MBL activities and ILDs for the physical science course, which covers both physics and chemistry topics.  The faculty members are gaining experience with the software, the equipment, and the active learning environment in local and national workshops and team-teaching assignments that partner an instructor new to MBL with a more experienced colleague. This project can serve as a model for the implementation of MBL and active learning in physics and physical science in a two-year college setting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
