 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human beings, like all organisms that move in the world, must remember\r\nthe location of objects and goals in order to live successfully. Unlike\r\nother organisms, human beings can learn about locations both\r\nsymbolically and through direct experience. The goal of this research\r\nprogram is to understand the development of spatial competence.\r\n\r\nRecent work has shown that many spatial skills arise earlier in\r\ndevelopment than had hitherto been supposed. However, early success may\r\nreflect the use of simple processes, different from mature coding,\r\nrather than innate specification of spatial competence. Three sets of\r\nstudies will be carried out to address this general issue. In one line\r\nof work, the focus is on the nature of infant location coding as\r\ninferred from their looking times to events. In a second line of work,\r\nthe aim is to evaluate a recent claim that children show evidence of an\r\ninnately-specified \"geometric module\" in their searches for hidden\r\nobjects. The third line of work will examine how children use simple\r\nmaps to find hidden objects.\r\n\r\nFinding evidence for developmental transformations in spatial\r\ndevelopment as well as for strong initial starting points is important\r\ntheoretically, as it provides support for a position in which biological\r\nspecification and environmental interaction interact to produce\r\ndevelopment. In practical terms, support for such a position would\r\nindicate that certain environmental experiences may be necessary for\r\nnormal development, and could even be manipulated to allow optimal\r\ndevelopment.\r\n",
