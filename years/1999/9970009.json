Ward Henson will use\r\nmethods from logic to solve problems within these areas and will use\r\nlogic as a basis for formulating new concepts and posing new problems\r\nwithin them.  This project has the following main aspects: (a) further\r\ndevelopment of Henson's logic for structures that are based on metric\r\nspaces, especially on Banach spaces, and continued application of this\r\ntheory to problems in functional analysis; (b) study of exponentiation\r\nand other elementary functions from the logical point of view; and (c)\r\ncontinued investigation of the computational complexity of logical\r\ndecision problems, especially those arising in the most central areas\r\nof mathematics.\r\n     During the past 40 years or more, techniques from logic have not\r\nonly clarified the foundations of mathematics, but they have contributed\r\nnew tools for solving mathematical problems.  These tools have been\r\nespecially effective in those areas of mathematics that are close to\r\nalgebra and number theory.  In this project, C. Ward Henson aims to\r\nmake those tools from logic equally effective in the areas of mathematics\r\nthat are close to topology, geometry, and analysis.\r\n***\r\n \r\n",
