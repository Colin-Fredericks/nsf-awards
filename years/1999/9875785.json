Reproductive isolation is one of the most important biological processes for creating and maintaining this biodiversity diversity. When individuals from different populations do not mate then the populations can evolve independently and potentially create new species. The Hawaiian picture-winged flies and Hawaiian Drosophila in general are a highly speciose group of animals with over 500 species that are found only in the Hawaiian Islands. The fragmentation of suitable habitat due to lava flows and variable climates across the island restricts the distribution of species into many isolated populations. This study will use molecular genetic techniques to compare the degree of genetic isolation to the degree of reproductive isolation among populations in these different habitats.  The understanding of these biological processes will influence management strategies for conservation biology in Hawaii and across the planet.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian Islands and especially the Big Island of Hawaii offer unique opportunities to investigate the formation and maintenance of biodiversity.  Approximately 81% of the birds, 89% of the flowering plants and 99% of the terrestrial invertebrates are native only to the Hawaiian Islands. Many of these animals and plants are threatened or in danger of extinction. The unique animals and plants coupled with the highly fragmented populations of many species provide the islands with difficult challenges for the conservation of biological diversity. This project will be integrated into an ecology, evolution and conservation biology program being developed at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. The integration of research and education in the general area of environmental biology is vital to the preservation of Hawaii's biodiversity.\r\n",
