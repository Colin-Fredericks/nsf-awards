Specific equipment to be acquired includes fire fighting equipment, an air compressor, vibration monitoring equipment, exposure suits, an outboard engine, a sheave and tool van to support remotely-operated vehicle operations, an upgrade to an X-band radar, and replacement tubes for one rigid-hull inflatable boat.  In addition to equipment for their own vessels, WHOI will acquire vibration monitoring systems identical to their own to be installed on sister vessels R/V Wecoma (Oregon State University) and R/V Endeavor (University of Rhode Island), and funds are provided here for training of ships' personnel at all three sites.  The shared-use equipment supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies from Woods Hole research vessels throughout the world ocean during 1999 and future years. \r\n***\r\n",
