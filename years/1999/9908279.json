 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop focuses on the topic of 'Geography in the 21st Century' with the overall objective of bringing together a collection of visionary thinkers from the field to discuss a broad array of topics around the following questions: What topical areas in geographic research will emerge as the most important in the near and mid-distant future?  Will research in the 21st Century be dominated by single researchers or groups of researchers from one discipline or will multi-investigator, cross-disciplinary efforts better serve the dominant topical areas?  How do we effectively, efficiently, and quickly transfer and integrate cutting-edge research into the educational arena?  What are promising technological areas that will facilitate geographic research and teaching? How do we train teachers to train other teachers to use the resources and technologies that are becoming available in a computer-based information society?  Ultimately, the vision is to design and develop a National Geography Learning Network that will facilitate the implementation of answers to each of the above questions?  \r\n\r\nFor the workshop, selected individuals will be asked to prepare a brief introductory statement to help guide general discussion on each topic.  General discussion will be taped and the original contributors, along with two other volunteers, will enlarge the original paper to include the essence of workshop discussion.  These individual reports will be edited and combined by the workshop coordinator to produce a White Paper for distribution to NSF and to be made available to members of the Association of American Geographers, the National Council for Geographic Education, and to other academic or non-academic bodies or individuals who express an interest in the topic.  The White Paper will be taken as a central planning document for attempts by the Association of American Geographers to develop a web-based National Geography Learning Network.\r\n",
