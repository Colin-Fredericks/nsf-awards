 "awd_abstract_narration": "9977482\r\nNuzzo\r\n\r\nA state-of-the-art X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) that will be capable of collecting high energy resolution spectra as well as 2-dimensional photoelectron images will be acquired with Major Research Instrumentation program funds.  The instrument will be equipped with a ultra-high vacuum sample preparation chamber, allowing in-situ experiments of film growth and surface treatments.  This instrument will be located at the Center for Microanalysis of Materials (CMM)) at the University of Illinois-Urbana/Champaign.  Availability of the XPS system is critical to several research programs that are currently active at the university. These include: 1) self-assembling materials and surface chemical reactions; 2) synthesis and characterization of catalytic materials; 3) localized corrosion; and 4) electronic materials.  The XPS instrument will also meet the needs of users in the expanding research areas of biomaterials who will have a particular need for the in-situ sample cooling capabilities of the instrument.  In addition to the above programs, the instrument will see widespread use in many other graduate research and education programs.  The operating mode of the CMM has had a major impact on graduate research and educational programs at this and other institutions. Over the past five years, more than 80 graduate students, post-docs and visiting research scientists have been educated in the theory and operation of X-ray photoelectron spectrometers and nearly 300 researchers have used CMM XPS systems.  When integrated into the CMM, the instrument will see extensive use by a projected 50-60 users annually. \r\n\r\nAn X-ray photoelectron spectrometer will be acquired with Major Research Instrumentation program funds.  This instrument will be used in the projects of researchers from a variety of departments at the university.  The instrument will have a significant impact on research training due to its availability to students, from undergraduates to post-docs, for hands-on training.\r\n",
