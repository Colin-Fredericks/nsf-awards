 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal addresses several questions that arise in problems\r\nin Physics and Engineering. We describe one of the problems that\r\nwe have proposed. A basic situation that arises in Engineering problems \r\nis to construct membranes composed out of two materials with different \r\ndensities. We impose additional requirements on the membranes\r\nconstructed, that is they also have the additional property that the first \r\neigenvalue be lowest possible. This is the requirement that the membrane \r\nhave the lowest tone. Natural questions that now arise are (1) Does such an\r\noptimal configuration exist?(2) Is the junction region between the\r\nmembranes, the so-called free boundary smooth? If not smooth what\r\nis the nature of the singularities, i.e. what is the Hausdorff dimension\r\nof the singular set. (3) If there is symmetry in the problem does it reflect\r\nand impose conditions that the materials have to be so glued as to respect \r\nthis symmetry. This problem is also amenable to numerical simulation\r\nwhich we have also carried out, and in part the numerics have provided us \r\nwith insight into what sort of rigorous theorems can be proved.\r\n\r\n     The project really stems from questions proposed to the PI by\r\nM. Imai and I. Ohnishi of the Institute of Electro-Communications\r\nin Tokyo and K. Kurata of the Tokyo Metropolitan University. The\r\nobject is to design composites of materials with two different densities\r\nsuch that the resulting composite has the lowest tone. For example one way \r\nto naively view this problem is to patch together two materials in\r\nsuch a way that the resulting composite membrane vibrates in the\r\nslowest possible way out of all possible configurations that\r\ncan be formed by gluing together the two given materials. The first\r\nquestion is (1) Is there always an optimal configuration possible?\r\n(2) Is the interface between the two materials making up the\r\nmembrane smooth or necessarily are there sharp spikes? (3) If\r\nthere is some additional symmetry in the shape of the membrane\r\ndoes it force that the materials be glued together in a way\r\nsuch that this symmetry is to be respected? These are basic\r\nEngineering questions that arise in many situations where say vibrations\r\nare to be kept to a minimum. Computer studies help, but what nails\r\ndown with certainty, the description of the optimal configuration,\r\nare rigorous theorems about the arrangement of the materials. This is\r\none of many problems in our project which can be summarized by saying\r\nthat it is the determination of optimal shapes in the design\r\nof composite membranes so as to minimize vibrations and if possible\r\ndetermine a explicit recipe(algorithm) that will tell us how\r\nto achieve this optimal configuration.\r\n",
