 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mhaskar will continue his investigations on the complexity problem in\r\nthe theory of neural networks and construction of multiscales based on\r\northogonal polynomial coefficients as well as samples of the target\r\nfunctions. Variations of such classical methods from approximation\r\ntheory as summability methods and  polynomial inequalities will be\r\ndeveloped to provide a unified theory of these apparently diverse areas.\r\nThe work will be applied to the numerical construction of orthogonal\r\npolynomials, approximation on the sphere using scattered data, and the\r\ntheory of system identification.\r\n\r\nAlthough approximation theory is a classical area of mathematics, active\r\nfor more than a hundred years, technological progress in the areas of\r\nneural networks and wavelets has given rise to many new possibilities\r\nfor applications of approximation theory. Neural networks and wavelets\r\nare both useful in high speed parallel computing, and naturally involve\r\nthe approximation of functions. Approximation theory techniques used\r\nwith neural networks have produced dramatically better results in\r\ncertain applications to array antenna technology, pattern recognition,\r\nand financial time series prediction.",
