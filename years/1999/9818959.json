 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop sensitive statistical procedures for detecting and recognizing patterns and changes in development, learning and problem solving.  A model based on microdevelopmental analyses of learning and problem solving shows that these processes consist of a series of microdevelopmental sequences, each starting anew and developing from lower levels of knowledge.  When learning shifts to the next microdevelopmental sequence, the increments in participants' levels of knowledge undergo a change in distribution.  Statistical methods of change-point analysis are utilized to detect and test such shifts.  The analysis involves detecting change points in ordinal data; multiple change points of an a priori unknown number; change points in the distribution of serially dependent data; and changes under a sequentially given prior distribtuion, based on \"the anticipated liklihood of a change.\"\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance researchers' ability to understand how development and learning occur.  The analytic identification of change points will guide researachers to examine specific segments in the learning process.  Such findings have applications for designing effective learning in and out of school by diverse populations.  Research on change points in learning can explain prevalent reports about students' difficulties in transferring their knowledge to new problems and can give guidelines for enhancing generalization in learning and problem solving.",
