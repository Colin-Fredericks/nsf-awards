Eliot B. \r\nUniversity of Massachusetts at Amherst\r\n\r\nPostdoc: Multiprocessor Garbage Collection: A Post-Doctoral Associateship in\r\nComputer-Communications Research  \r\n\r\nThe Java programming language has brought garbage collection (gc, automatic storage management) into the main stream as an important programming language feature.  Commercial interests are starting to build significant server applications in Java, running them on multiprocessors.  Yet very little is known about how to build and tune efficient garbage collectors for multiprocessor platforms.  The project builds on successes in building useful experimental prototypes and exploiting them to produce quantitative and qualitative results in the areas of garbage collection and the implementation of object-oriented programming languages.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project extends previously devised gc algorithms, gc toolkit software, a persistent object store, and a Java virtual machine implementation, to support Java gc (of both main memory and persistent objects) on multiprocessors and clusters (both shared and distributed\r\nmemory), and explores how to achieve good gc performance in terms of space, time, and minimal gc interruption.  The research results could be of assistance to commercial Java virtual machine vendors and server application builders.\r\n\r\nThe post-doctoral associate is given significant responsibility in all project activities, but in the context of a close mentoring relationship designed to support and mature the associate into a highly skilled independent researcher for future employment in industry or academe.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
