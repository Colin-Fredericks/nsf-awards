 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of methodology for the preparation of fluorinated organic compounds.   First, the project will provide new, general methodology for the synthesis of cis- and trans-2-substituted-1,2-difluoroethylenes allowing both an experimental and calculation approach to the study of the cis-effect in determining thermodynamic stability of these alkenes.   Second, new synthons such as (E)- and (Z)-R3SnCF=CFSnR3 will be used as reagents for the regio- and/or stereospecific incorporation of fluorine into organic compounds.  Third, synthetic methods for the preparation of chiral alpha-fluorophosphonates will be  developed as a means of preparing important phosphate mimics.\r\n\r\n With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Donald J. Burton of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Iowa.  Professor Burton will focus his work on developing organofluorine synthetic methodology.   Organofluorine chemistry is a subfield of organic chemistry known for its commercial importance and its novelty.  Replacement of hydrogens by fluorine in organic compounds results in significant differences in physical properties and chemical behavior.  The work will contribute to the training of young scientists who in their postgraduate years will contribute to the industrial development of new fluorinated materials and devices, new fluorinated polymers and new fluorine-containing pharmaceutical agents.\r\n",
