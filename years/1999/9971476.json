 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971476\r\nCarlsson\r\nThis grant supports theoretical research on the electronic structure of metal atoms with ionic bonding.  Metal atoms in ionic bonding configurations occur in a large number of technologically important materials ranging from ceramics to biomolecular materials.  Electronic effects are important in the structure and function of many of these materials, for example in determining the square coordination of copper in copper-oxide materials.  Existing simulations for ionically bound metals based on classical force fields treat electronic effects with energy terms of uncertain accuracy.  The research here uses an approximate quantum-mechanical analysis to develop force fields that treat electronic efects reliably.  For transition metals, a moment expansion based on the width of the d-complex is used to develop an energy function similar to the \"modified embedded-atom method.\"  The angular dependence of the energy is obtained as a fourth-order polynomial in cosine theta, where theta is a bond angle centered on the transition metal.  For non-transition metals, a fourth-order perturbation expansion is used to generate angular potentials whose functional forms will be fit to results from accurate density-functional calculations, for crystalline structures and small molecules.  The resulting energy functions will be incorporated into existing force fields for metals in ionic materials and for metals attached to covalent frameworks.  The improved force fields will be applied to the analysis of the local structure around transition metals in zeolite structures and to the energetics of metal ions in self-assembled biomolecular materials. The research will be done in cooperation with the Danish Technical University, the National Institute for Standards and Technology and the Ford Motor Company.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports theoretical research on the electronic structure of metal atoms with ionic bonding.  At first glance, metal atoms in pure metals are bound together by the \"metallic bond.\"  However, all metallic bonds have some degree of ionicity, or electrostatic attraction.  Metal atoms in ionic bonding configurations occur in a large number of technologically important materials ranging from ceramics to biomolecular materials.  This research will develop accurate methods to determine the interplay between metallic and ionic bonding.  Two test cases will be considered: metal atoms in an intrinsically ionic environment (zeolites) and metal atoms in a covalent environment (biomolecular materials).  The research will be done in cooperation with the Danish Technical University, the National Institute for Standards and Technology and the Ford Motor Company.\r\n***\r\n",
