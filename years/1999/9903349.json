Fluids throughout these systems typically contain significant concentrations of the major solutes, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.  These cations greatly enhance SiO2 dissolution rates over those measured in pure (deionized) water.  In contrast, micromolar levels of aluminum exhibit an opposing rate-inhibition of silica dissolution at near-neutral to weakly-acidic pH.  A quantitative and mechanistic understanding of rate-mediating effects is essential to the accuracy of numerical models which predict silica mobility.  This study will answer a first order question:  How do dissolved constituents act in concert as a solute mixture to control net rates of silica dissolution in the complex fluids of natural environments? Using an experimental approach that integrates techniques from geochemical kinetics and surface science, this study will quantify rates of quartz and amorphous silica dissolution (30-300 degrees C) in carefully designed solutions that contain solutes as single salts and mixtures as a function of concentration and pH.  Rates will be determined using our hydrothermal mixed flow reactor system over a range of reaction affinity by adjusting steady state silica concentrations.  Parallel investigations of selected silica surfaces will be conducted using in situ Atomic Force Microscopy, surface titrations, and ex situ XPS and Auger analyses.  The findings will allow us to construct a quantitative model for how solutes control the reactivity of crystalline and amorphous silica in solutions that begin to approximate real-world fluids.\r\n\r\n",
