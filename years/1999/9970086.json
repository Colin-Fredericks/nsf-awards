 "awd_abstract_narration": "Keener\r\n9970086\r\n     The investigator develops and uses mathematical models and\r\ntools to study a variety of problems in physiology organized\r\naround the theme of excitability and wave propagation.  The three\r\nmain interconnected thrusts for this work are: 1) to develop\r\nmathematical models that can be used to describe specific\r\nphysiological phenomena; 2) to develop analytical techniques,\r\nnumerical algorithms, and computational tools to study the model\r\nequations; 3) to use analytical and numerical tools to understand\r\nthe behavior of these systems and to thereby better understand\r\nthe underlying physiological processes.  The physiological\r\nproblems are drawn from four specific areas: 1) cardiology and\r\nthe problems of fibrillation onset and defibrillation; 2) calcium\r\ndynamics and excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac cells; 3)\r\nthe role of microtubule networks in the transport of chemicals\r\nthroughout a cell; 4) the involvement and spatial spread of\r\nbacteria in chemical reactions, such as mine tailings dumps,\r\nwater treatment plants, oil spills, etc.\r\n     The common thread running through this work is that chemical\r\nsignals underlie motion, and this work is directed toward an\r\nunderstanding of how chemical signals are generated, controlled,\r\nand how they mediate motion.  Such an understanding is a crucial\r\nfirst step toward solving several important health-related and\r\nenvironmentally related problems.  Specifically, an improved\r\nunderstanding of the heartbeat and how and why it fails could\r\ngive new clues as to how to prevent or cure some dangerous\r\ncardiac disorders.  Similarly, an improved understanding of how\r\nbacteria (and other living cells) move and regulate their motion\r\ncould lead to improved organic control of toxic chemical wastes.\r\n",
