 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: DMS-9971802\r\n\r\nPrincipal Investigators: Jerome Levine and Daniel Ruberman\r\n\r\nAbstract: This proposal discusses problems in several areas of knot theory, and low-dimensional topology.   Ruberman will undertake a comprehensive investigation of the topology of the diffeomorphism group of a 4-manifold using tools of gauge theory.  Ruberman will continue to work on cutting and pasting operations on 3-manifolds, with the goal of understanding how these affect Seiberg-Witten invariants of 3-manifolds.  He will also begin an approach to classical knot cobordism, using tools of foliation theory.  Levine will continue his work on the theory of finite-type invariants. He will investigate several new proposals for extending the notion of finite-type, which was originally confined to the class of homology-spheres, to general 3-manifolds. This will also involve further investigation of the relation between finite-type invariants and the structure of the mapping class group of a surface. In another direction Levine will also continue work on the concordance classification of linksin 3-space. Ruberman and Levine will jointly investigate link cobordism in even dimensions.\r\n\r\nModern geometric methods, some of which originate in theoretical physics, continue to have a major impact on the study of topological objects such as knots, links and 3 and 4-dimensional manifolds.  Conversely the understanding of the structure of these geometric objects, in their role as modeling the real world, has important applications to theoretical physics.  The research proposed concerns the study of numerical and algebraic invariants of each of these categories of geometric objects and the use of such invariants in the study of the structure theory of knots,  surface symmetries and 3-dimensional manifolds, and in the study of symmetries and deformations of 4-dimensional manifolds. The diverse mathematical tools involved in our projects involve techniques from partial differential equations, differential geometry, combinatorics, representation theory, group theory and classical cut and paste techniques for the construction and analysis of 3-dimensional manifolds.\r\n",
