The objective of the conference is to provide a unique forum for discourse on processing issues related to fibrous reinforcements and their composites.  The scope of this conference includes polymeric, metallic, and ceramic fibers and composites. The sessions are divided into three major categories: fibers, composites, and future directions in this field.  A main goal is to examine aspects of processing of fibers and composites with a view toward obtaining desired sets of properties.  In both the fibers and composites categories, there are four sessions.  It is expected that the participants will reach a consensus with regards to future directions, taking into account the interdisciplinary nature of the field as well as the expected changes in emphasis resulting from a past focus on defense-related applications to civilian applications of composites.  Support from the National Science Foundation enables graduate students to attend and provides partial support to a few distinguished researchers.\r\n%%%\r\nThe field of fibers and fiber-reinforced composites has become very important in recent years.  It is recognized that processing is the key to obtaining a desired set of properties in these materials, hence the focus on this subject in the conference.\r\n***\r\n",
