 "awd_abstract_narration": "Like most Muslim and many Christian countries around the world, Israel has a legal system in which religious law holds an institutional position in state law.   The tension between secular and religious principles in law can be seen in the decisions of the Israeli High Court of Justice, an institution that offers a focal point for this research.  This project involves the analysis of writings of the justices of this court on matters of religion and state, including, but not limited to judicial decisions, as well as the briefs and other legal materials of women's social-movement attorneys who have challenged rabbinical authorities.  The research question is how the court came to move more and more deliberately into establishing secular women's rights.",
