 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative research project of Arthur Delcher at Loyola College at Maryland (RUI award IIS-9820497) and Steven Salzberg at the Institute for Genomic Research (award IIS-9902923). The quantity of DNA sequence data is exploding, and with this growth comes a parallel growth in the demand for computational methods for sequence analysis. This abundance of data demands new and highly accurate computational analysis tools to explore these sequences and maximize the scientific knowledge gained from them. This interdisciplinary project combines the latest techniques in data modeling and data mining with knowledge of molecular biology to find genes and other scientifically significant patterns in DNA sequence databases.  The Glimmer system uses Interpolated Markov Models (IMMs) to finding genes in microbial genomes. This tremendously successful system has found over 98% of the genes in the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, and others. This project is developing new systems to find genes in the much more complex DNA of higher organisms, and at the same time advancing the state of the art for the underlying IMM technology. Specific foci of the project include: developing improved probabilistic models for gene finding; developing algorithmic methods for identifying laterally transferred genes and other unusual DNA sequences; and developing IMMs and other probabilistic techniques for analyzing DNA in higher organisms including plants and mammals.  This project will dramatically improve our ability to discover genes and other biologically significant features in a wide range of organisms, leading to the development of new antibiotics and vaccines and to a better understanding of how DNA directs the functions of a living cell. The software will be freely disseminated in the genomics community.\r\nhttp://www.tigr.org/softlab/glimmer/glimmer.html \r\n\r\n",
