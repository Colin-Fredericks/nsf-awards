May                        \r\n\r\nSupport is requested for the continuation of the GT-SUPREEM program, in which the \r\nGeorgia Institute of Technology serves as a NSF REU site.  GT-SUPREEM is a ten-week summer \r\nresearch program designed to attract qualified minority students into the field of electrical \r\nengineering.  Ten students of at least junior-level undergraduate standing will be recruited annually \r\non a nationwide basis and paired with both a faculty and a graduate student mentor to undertake \r\nresearch projects in the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  The students \r\nwill be housed on campus, and in addition to lodging, meals, and a travel allowance, will be provided \r\nwith a $4,000 stipend.  At the conclusion of the summer, the students will be expected to prepare \r\nboth oral and written summaries of their research projects.  It is anticipated that this experience will \r\nencourage these students to become applicants for graduate school in the ensuing years.  Three years \r\nof support are requested.  \r\n",
