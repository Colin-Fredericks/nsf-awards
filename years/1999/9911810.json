 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project provides information on the methods used to address issues of demographic diversity in recently funded SMET education projects (post-secondary). Undergraduate students (3) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) work on this research from late October to mid-December. They receive academic credit for the research endeavor. The program is supervised by WPI faculty, with consultation from NSF. The study is based in a program previously established at WPI, which is being adapted to target an analysis of effective mechanisms to improve demographic diversity in higher education in SMET.\r\n\r\nPrior to engaging in the research activity, the students participate in a research methods course that prepares the students for the diversity study, including the development of a formal research plan. The plan includes a formal literature review, hypotheses, and a planned methodology for testing the hypotheses (qualitative and quantitative analysis). This package is reviewed by WPI faculty, with consultation from NSF. The students then proceed to pursue the research program.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the study, the students present their research outcomes in a formal research defense for NSF personnel, WPI faculty, and other representatives of WPI. They also provide a final project report. The project report is to include a revised literature review and methodology, the data gathered with the associated qualitative and quantitative analyses, and the resulting conclusions and recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe students will benefit from the substantive learning opportunities in research development and application, as well as exposure to policy development, interaction with diverse science education professionals.\r\n",
