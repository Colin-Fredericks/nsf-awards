 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed study is to address the following research question:  How does teacher leadership work, as configured in USIs, help to develop and sustain SMT education reform on scale?  The planned research will test the following hypothesis about the nature of teacher leadership work in USI sites:\r\n\r\nTeacher leadership, when geared toward supporting the learning of other classroom teachers, is a powerful strategy for helping districts get to scale with science, mathematics, and technology education reform.\r\n\r\nA two-tiered sampling strategy is proposed-a purposeful sampling of USI sites and a purposeful sampling of teacher leaders within each site.   Working with approximately seven USI sites, the methodology includes collection and analysis of USI documents, surveys, on-site observations and focus group discussions, and interviews with selected teacher leaders, principals, and districts office staff. \r\n",
