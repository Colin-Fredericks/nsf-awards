 "awd_abstract_narration": "On March 28, 1999, an earthquake of magnitude 6.6 (Ms) shook Northern India, focused beneath the Garwhal Himalaya.   A similar earthquake occurred in 1991 within 100 km of this recent earthquake.  This resulted in over 200 slopes failures, producing an equivalent net lowering of the landscape of ~ 0.007 mm.  This is several orders of magnitude lower than the assumed annual lowering of Himalayan landscapes.  The 1991 study questioned the importance of high magnitude-lower frequency processes in the evolution of Himalayan landscapes and suggested that most effective landscape changes are the result of low magnitude-high frequency processes such as weathering and fluvial erosion.  Few studies have been undertaken on the effects of great earthquake on landscape evolution within the Himalayas and it is therefore difficult to assess if the 1991 earthquake was typical.  We, therefore, propose to examine the geomorphic consequences of the 1999 earthquake and to compare this with the effects of the 1991 earthquake.  This study will help test if great earthquakes are important in the net denudation of Himalyan landscapes and it will also aid in hazard mitigation.\r\n\r\n",
