 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the CASES-99 program (Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study-1999), the PI will measure the temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind velocity with high resolution in time and altitude using instruments suspended from a tethered kite or, in calm conditions, a tethered blimp.  The purpose of CASES is to study the physics and dynamics of the very stable nocturnal boundary using an array of surface-based instruments, remote sensing observations, a 60-m instrumented tower, and two instrumented airplanes.  Observations by the kite/blimp system will provide vertical profiles up to about 2 km, supplementing the aircraft measurements and filling the important altitude gap between the top of the tower and the minimum aircraft altitude.  It will also provide time series of temperature and wind velocity at selected altitudes to permit the observation of transient events such as intermittent bursts of turbulence, strong gusts, and wave motions.  Phenomena of special interest are low-level jets, wave instabilities, and the turbulent mixing of air across the nocturnal inversion.  These measurements, in combination with simultaneous observations by the instrumented tower, the aircraft, and the remote sensing equipment (radars, lidars, wind profilers) will constitute an excellent set of data for studying the dynamics of the stable boundary layer throughout its entire vertical extent.",
