 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reaction pathways synthesis has the ability to produce environmentally benign processes with a lower overall associated risk factor both for human health and environment.  In this project a versatile reaction pathway generation method will be developed for use as a pollution prevention design tool.  The reaction pathways generated by this method may allow a wider range of environmentally benign reactions to be carried out at minimal cleanup and disposal costs through efficient use of intermediates.  Extnesions of the work include design for easily separable intermediates, applications to reaction engineering, and incorporation of kinetics.  Two major approaches to reaction pathway synthesis will be developed and compared: optimization and construction (lexicographic technique).  Previous work demonstrated the pronciple of automatic, thermodynamically feasible, reaction cluster generation.  This technique will be reined to improve its utility and computational speed through an aggregate mathematical formulation and a computationally efficient algorighm.  In parallel the construction approach to reaction pathways will be pursued.  These technqiues have the power to design for reactions based on safety and toxicity considerations, explicitly incorporating risk informaiton into design procedure.",
