 "awd_abstract_narration": "9815544\r\nYuen\r\n\r\nThis award supports a two year collaborative research project between Professor David Yuen of the University of Minnesota and Professor Satoru Honda of Hiroshima University in Japan.  The researchers will be undertaking a study of modeling and visualizing the complexity of mantle convection in a heterogeneous medium.  Heterogeneities in the mantle are due to the mixing and stirring of a wide variety of sources.  These will in turn produce heterogeneities in the viscosity field, because of the rheological dependence on stress, strain-rate, grain-size and composition.  The slab can also be considered as a complex rheological medium and its strength may be strongly dependent on the speed of subduction.  The researchers plan to study the dynamics of mixing in hetergeneous viscous fluids in convection and the effects of grain-size in mantle convection, especially the interaction between grain-size growth and viscous heating and the strength of slabs with subduction.  They will also work on issues of \r\nco-processing in visualization of data sets taken from numerical simulations in both the U.S. and Japan.   \r\n\r\nThis project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  The researchers will have the use of the excellent high-performance computing and scientific visualization at Minnesota, Los Alamos and the IBM Watson Lab.  In Japan they will have access to the high-performance IBM clusters, the University of Tokyo's Hitachi computer and the Digital-alpha cluster at Hiroshima University.  Important outcomes of this joint work will cover the areas of solid-earth geodynamics, mixing in heterogeneous convecting fluids, high-performance network computing, and advanced scientific visualization techniques.  Younger scientists and graduate students will also be participating in this project.  The researchers plan to share the results of their research on their university web sites in the U.S. and Japan.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.\r\n***\r\n",
