This interdisciplinary approach combines theory and experiments from verv different fields to explore computation at the molecular level.\r\n\r\nDNA computing has fueled a tremendous amount of excitement by offering a fresh paradigm for performing and viewing computations: it is biological mathematics, while also mathematical biology. Encoding of data in DNA strings coupled with the power of molecular biology allows the execution of computational operations on single strands of DNA in the laboratory. As a small drop of solution can house several quadrillion DNA molecules, DNA computers use much less energy and space than traditional computers. Consequently, they offer the tantalizing potential of one day outperforming electronic computers. Computing with DNA is also massively parallel, with billions and trillions of molecules undergoing simultaneous chemical reactions and performing computations almost spontaneously. The product of a radically different marriage of computer science to molecular biology, the fledgling field of DNA computers began in 1994, when Adleman surprised the scientific community by using DNA molecules, protein enzymes, and chemicals to solve an instance of the Directed Hamiltonian Path Problem.\r\nThis research proposes to expand the field of DNA based computers to RNA, specificaly:\r\n(1) To develop a panel of RNA based tools for use in computation\r\n(2) To use this repertoire of tools to tackle a wide class of mathematical search problems. \r\n(3) To address the limits of scalability of each aspect of the design of experiments,\r\n(4) To carefully  examine the differences between RNA versus DNA for molecular computing\r\n(5) To address a series of larger computational problems. \r\nWhile this will be the first project to exploit RNA for its computing potential, it will also be one of the first projects to use biological molecules to solve problems beyond the scope of previous proof-of-principle experiments.\r\nEducation Plan: A series of interdisciplinary courses, seminars, and conferences centered around DNA computing are planned. A seminar course will be developed on DNA computing for freshmen entering the fields of engineering, mathematics, the biological and physical sciences, as well as humanities. This course will introduce a new area of research to the next generation of scientists while at the same time educating non-science majors about the cutting edge field of molecular computers. Other educational plans include mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, teaching DNA Computing at a summer Workshop on Molecular Evolution, and participating in a science outreach program for high school teachers.\r\n",
