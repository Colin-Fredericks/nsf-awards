Also to be studied are symmetries \r\nand their related mathematics.  This is an area that \r\nhas had an enormous impact on particle physics, \r\nthe study of crystals in chemistry, and mathematical \r\nresearch ever since the pioneering work of mathematician \r\nIssai Schur and  physicist Hermann Weyl.  Its continuing \r\nvitality is evidenced by much current activity \r\nand many open problems.  For example, crystal\r\nbases correspond to absolute zero temperature in\r\nsolvable lattice models in physics. Such bases\r\nhave remarkable properties.  One typical \r\nproblem to be addressed is to construct such bases\r\nwhen the symmetry operators exhibit certain behavior.  \r\n \r\n",
