Each episode will incorporate current advances in genetics, developmental biology, and evaluation, presenting them in a manner that is accessible to the lay audience.  The series has been developed by the Sea Studios Foundation and is a co-production of Sea Studios Foundation and National Geographic Television.  The eight, one-hour television programs will be supported by a consortium of informal science institutions that will implement ancillary programs in partner museums, zoos, and aquaria and by outreach materials, including print and a web site.\r\n\r\nMark Shelley, President of Sea Studios, and Nancy Burnett, CEO of the Sea Studios Foundation, will be co-Executive Producers of the series.  Chuck Baxter, Professor of Biology at Stanford University, will be the Science Content Director.  Science advisors include:  Richard C. Brusca, Marine Biology Graduate Program, University of Charleston; Mimi Koehl, Department of Integrative Biology, UC Berkeley; Jane Lubchenko, Department of Zoology, Oregon State University; Rudolf A. Raff, Indiana Molecular Biology Institute; and Dennis Willows, Director, Friday Harbor Marine Station, University of Washington.\r\n",
