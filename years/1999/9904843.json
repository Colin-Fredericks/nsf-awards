 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Moore and John Tossell of the University of Maryland, College Park, are supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study discrete steps in the processes leading to chemical change when low-energy electrons interact with polyatomic molecules and molecular fragments.   Dissociative electron attachment to molecules and molecular radicals will be examined in experiments in which a low-energy electron beam passes through a gas phase target.  Techniques will be developed to produce and quantitatively detect radicals in the gas phase.  In addition, dissociation and subsequent chemical reactions induced by electron impact upon molecules adsorbed onto metallic and semiconductor surfaces will be studied.  Quantum chemical calculations will be carried out to describe the relevant electronic properties of target molecules and radicals, selected for their pertinence to plasma-chemical processing and electron-and ion-beam deposition.  Outcomes are expected to provide quantitative information, such as cross sections, that can have useful impacts in modeling and optimizing industrial fabrication technologies.  \r\n\r\nLow energy collisions of electrons and molecules can lead to chemical bond rupture.  The products of these interactions tend to be radicals and ions, which are chemically reactive species that are ordinarily only found at very high temperatures.  This creation of aggressive chemical species at low temperatures from relatively benign starting materials accounts for the exploitation of low energy electron collision processes in a number of industrial fabrication technologies.  Examples include electron- and ion-beam lithography and plasma and chemical processes used for cleaning, etching, and deposition in the manufacture of integrated circuits.",
