 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Partnership for Environmental Technology Education (PETE) proposes a revised version of the FAST Leadership Corps Project -- Faculty Associates in Science and Technology Leadership Corps for Enhancement of Environmental Technology Education. The FAST project (FAST-I) was a very successful professional development program for faculty from two-year colleges. From our work in the program, we feel our proposed professional development activities hold real promise for making FAST-Il a stronger and more broadly-based faculty development program than its predecessor.  FAST-Il will serve a new cohort of 70-100 faculty for each of 3 years. We plan to start the program as soon as funding is granted. There are three phases of activities.\r\n\tPhase 1. Curriculum 101 --- An Introduction to Macro and Micro Issues in Science and Technology Education: An entering cohort would begin the FAST Project by completing a Web-based workshop. Faculty without Web access will receive hard copies.\r\n\tPhase 2.-- Faculty Associate Summer Internship: Following their workshop experience, Associates would enter a 4-8 week internship in private industry, a national laboratory, Department of Defense facility, or a federal or state regulatory agency.\r\n\tPhase 3.  Course and Curriculum Development Technical Assistance Network: In the academic year following the Summer Internship, Faculty Associates will work on course and curriculum design, developing a new course or revising an existing course.  \r\n\tThe FAST-Il Project will rest on a sound foundation of program components developed and evaluated in its precursor. The data from FAST-I allow us to conclude that the FAST program is a viable model for community and technical college faculty development that will facilitate nation-wide systemic impact on environmental technology education.\r\n",
