The work\r\nfocuses on adaptive multilevel finite element methods, a powerful\r\nclass of numerical approximation techniques for dealing with\r\nirregular domain geometries, degenerate coefficients, and\r\ncomplicated nonlinearities, in an optimal or nearly optimal way.\r\nSpecific target applications for this work are the nonlinear\r\nPoisson-Boltzmann equation arising in continuum models of\r\nbiomolecules, the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints in the\r\nEinstein equations, and some related elliptic and parabolic\r\nequations that arise in the topological classification of\r\nsurfaces in geometry.  While this work has a large theoretical\r\ncomponent, to have an impact in biology and physics requires a\r\nsubstantial amount of software development, as well as\r\ninterdisciplinary collaboration with scientists in the relevant\r\nareas.  The required implementations are developed by the\r\ninvestigator and his students as class library extensions to his\r\nsoftware package MC (Manifold Code), and the resulting software\r\nis made available to researchers in the biology and physics\r\ncommunities.  This project is an NSF CAREER grant.\r\n     The computational methods developed in this project have a\r\ndirect impact on the modeling capabilities of rational drug\r\ndesign researchers using structure-based models of biomolecules.\r\nThe Poisson-Boltzmann equation is a well-established model for\r\nelectrostatic interactions of biomolecules, allowing one to\r\npredict the effectiveness of a candidate drug molecule in\r\nnegotiating the onion-like layers of the electrostatic field on\r\nits journey to bind to the active site in a target biomolecule.\r\nFor example, through the use of these types of structure-based\r\nnumerical models, one can predict the effectiveness of a\r\ncandidate HIV proteinase inhibitor in binding to the active site\r\nin the HIV proteinase.  However, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation\r\npresents severe technical difficulties for solution by numerical\r\nmethods on computers.  By developing improved multilevel\r\nnumerical techniques to reduce the computer time required to\r\nsolve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and at the same time\r\nproducing more accurate solutions through the use of adaptive\r\nfinite element methods, the investigator gives drug designers\r\naccess to models that produce more accurate results in less time.\r\nIn addition, a critical ingredient for the success of this and\r\nrelated projects is the education and training of the next\r\ngeneration of computational mathematicians.  Therefore, a fully\r\nintegrated involvement in undergraduate and graduate\r\ncomputational mathematics education is an integral part of the\r\nproject.  In particular, the investigator develops two new\r\nproject-oriented, interdisciplinary, computational mathematics\r\ncourses at UC San Diego, modeled after a successful experimental\r\ncourse he taught at UC Irvine in 1997-1998.  This project is a\r\nNational Science Foundation CAREER grant.  NSF strongly\r\nencourages the early development of academic faculty as both\r\neducators and researchers.  The Faculty Early Career Development\r\n(CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program that provides for\r\nthe support of junior faculty within the context of their overall\r\ncareer development.  It combines in a single program the support\r\nof quality research and education in the broadest sense and the\r\nfull participation of those traditionally underrepresented in\r\nsciences and engineering.  This program enhances and emphasizes\r\nthe importance the Foundation places on the development of full,\r\nbalanced academic careers.\r\n",
