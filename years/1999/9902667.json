The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide support for a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Eric P. Rubenstein to work with researchers at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in La Serena, Chile under the direction of Dr. Nick B. Suntzeff, and twelve months of support for a reentry year at Yale to work with Dr. Pierre Demarque.   Partial support for this project is provided by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and their Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics Program.\r\nThis project will involve the measurement of the mass to luminosity ratio of metal-poor stars.  These stars are considered to be benchmarks to allow extrapolations of cosmological significance.  Detailed measurement of their properties is not only interesting in stellar astronomical research but will have cosmological implications.  The observations will be made using the Southern Hemisphere telescopes in Chile.  While at Yale, Drs. Rubenstein and Demarque will make extensive comparisons with theoretical models and create new models compatible with the observations from Chile.\r\nWhile in Chile, Dr. Rubenstein will be establishing collaborations with a variety of astronomers at CITO, as well as from the Universidad de Chile, such as Maria Teresa Ruiz and Jose Maza, who are active in stellar population work and supernovae studies.\r\n***\r\n",
