The Department will purchase computing and fabrication equipment which will be dedicated to support the aforementioned projects:  Stratasys system, workstations, MotionStar motion capture system, etc.  The goal of this research project is to build self-reconfiguring robotics systems at the mini and MEMS scale, and to develop a science-based for planning and controlling highly distributed reconfigurable robot systems.  Mini and MEMS self-configuring robots that employ the principles of self-organization and self-assembly to combine structure with function will be designed and built.  The equipment will be used for the research mentioned, including in particular: (1) developing self-configuring mini-robot systems; (2) developing massively parallel control algorithms for MEMS devices; (3) developing novel algorithms for distributed control of massively parallel reconfiguring robot systems; and (4) combining the results on massively-parallel micro-fabricated MEMS actuators and self-reconfiguring systems to design, fabricate, control and program self-reconfiguring micro-robot systems, built using MEMS technology.  These advances in reconfigurable robotics science will greatly enhance the capabilities of distributed robot systems.",
