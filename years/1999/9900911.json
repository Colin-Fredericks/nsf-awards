 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to study social responses and communication patterns in the context of a natural disaster.  Hurricane Georges struck the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Alabama on August 29. With wind gusts of over 115 miles per hour, the storm left Gulf Coast residents with considerable damage from both winds and flooding. The three Mississippi coastal counties of Hancock, Jackson, and Harrison suffered the greatest effects of Georges' wrath. This project will study the processes surrounding preparation for and recovery from Hurricane Georges among residents of three communities in two of these counties. \r\n\r\nUsing random-digit dialing, this research will sample 250 households within each community, randomly selecting an adult household member to interview in each household by means of Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) techniques. Questions will cover such issues as the structure of respondents' core social networks prior to the storm and their use of formal versus informal sources of information and support. It is essential to gather information on (1) core network members, (2) support providers who lie inside and outside the core, and (3) the connections between core network members and nonroutine support providers who lie outside the core network. The research will use the information from Hurricane Georges to ask such questions as: Did ties to core network members link respondents with support providers outside the core? If they did, then are these links and resource transfers consistent with theoretical arguments for the strength of weak ties (a focus of the social resources strand of network analysis)? Answering these questions will allow us to understand better the implications of resource partitioning in social networks for resource activation in them.\r\n",
