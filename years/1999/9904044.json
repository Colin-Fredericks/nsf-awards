The research will build on over ten years of prior research to examine causal factors resulting in a shift from pastoral to agricultural land use by Maasai people of Tanzania.  Using social surveys and intensive interviews conducted by US and Tanzanian researchers, the project will examine family demography, history, and changes in subsistence strategies to explain the constraints and choices impelling a gradual shift from pastoral to agricultural household economy.  The trend towards sedentism by East Africa pastoralists has been significant, and has affected the wildlife preserves in the region.  This research will explain the decision to move from one means of livelihood to another by household level decisions, and will provide information valuable to local planners as well as relevant to other comparable situations in the world.  \r\n",
