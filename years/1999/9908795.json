 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Nan Rothschild, Mr. Kurt Jordan will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. The goal of his research is to understand the changes in social and community organization of the Iroquois people in the early 1700s after extensive contact with European colonists. Historical accounts, and limited archaeological data, indicate a change in settlement pattern. Prior to this time groups lived in large stockaded villages located in highly defensible positions. Afterwards primary settlements were much smaller and located in more open ground less suited to defensive purposes. While this general pattern is likely correct, there is much scientific disagreement over the timing, causes and character of household change. Many researchers assert that settlement dispersal was accompanied by the abandonment of traditional multi-family bark longhouses in favor of nuclear family sized European style log cabins. This argument asserts that larger settlements dispersed and longhouse construction was abandoned because of the disintegration of traditional matrilineal social organization, caused by years of European borne epidemics, warfare and adoption on non-Iroquois individuals and groups. The timing of the abandonment however in the Seneca New York region where Mr. Jordan works suggests an alternative explanation. There village relocations first occurred after an important series of peace treaties were enacted among the Iroquois, French, English and western Native American groups. Mr. Jordan believes that after several years of relative local peace, the Seneca Iroquois may have become convinced that the peace was going to be durable and thus dispersed to obtain better access to fields and water. If this hypothesis is correct, settlement shift does not imply a breakdown of traditional social organization but rather a reasoned and positive response to changed conditions. In an attempt to determine which answer is correct, Mr. Jordan will conduct archaeological research at the site of Townley-Read located near Geneva New York. He will conduct remote geophysical prospecting using a variety of techniques to locate buried house remains and then conduct partial excavation. Although he knows from surface materials that the settlement is both small and dispersed, it is uncertain what types of dwellings were built. Traditional matrilineal houses are distinct in size and shape from their colonial counterparts and the determination of social process at Townley-Read hinges on the type of house structures present.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons. It will provide insight into an important period of colonial history. It will shed new light on culture contact and change and assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
