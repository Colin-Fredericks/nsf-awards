 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of federal agencies have developed ongoing cooperative programs with the People's Republic of China.  Annex III to the US-PRC Protocol for Scientific and Technical Cooperative Research in Earthquake Studies, 'Earthquake Engineering and Hazards Mitigation' was initiated in 1981 between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Ministry of Construction on the Chinese side.  The protocol has as its primary objective the advancement of cooperative studies that will further earthquake hazard mitigation in both countries.  \r\n\r\nResearch programs of the Annex III Protocol have added substantially to the knowledge base in earthquake engineering and furthered protocol objectives of developing safe and cost effective engineering design methods, construction practices and other countermeasures for seismic safety.  A number of areas have been identified for collaborative study, including: hybrid seismic mitigation control of tall buildings, studies of collapse mechanisms of structures under seismic loadings, earthquake response of dams, dynamic interaction of arch dams; integrated earthquake mitigation studies for metropolitan areas, seismo-sociology, and new generation of seismic code for the ensuing century.\r\n\r\nExchange researchers between the US and China affords participants with opportunities to learn more about regionally specific earthquake impacts, approaches to preparedness, response and rebuilding, as well as the success of mitigation efforts.  It has been viewed as a critical mechanism of exchange on emergent earthquake engineering knowledge.  \r\n\r\nThis project will continue NSF support of the US-PRC Research Exchange Program, under the organizational supervision of MCEER.  MCEER's administrative infrastructure, its extensive international programs, and its successful execution of the past two phases of the project provides a convenient and capable basis for coordination of the program on behalf of NSF.  The exchange program will be implemented openly through review and selection by an external panel based on the merit, qualification, agreement by the host institution and potential  follow-up activities, which will be mutully benefical.\r\n\r\nThis is a cooperative earthquake hazard mitigation project under the US-PRC Earthquake Protocol, Annex III\r\n",
