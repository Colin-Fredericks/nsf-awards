 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University in collaboration with the University of Alabama and Duke University, seeks to enhance student learning of calculus and higher mathematics with funding under the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement, Track 2 (CCLI-A&I). This project addresses three specific problems in GSCC's calculus sequence: (1) limited lab facilities, (2) low success rates in Calculus I, and (3) low persistence rates in the calculus series.\r\n\r\nThe project goal is to make calculus more accessible to students and to ensure their persistence through the sequence with a successful completion. The project objectives are: (1) to achieve a 10% increase in success and persistence rates in the calculus sequence, targeting women and minorities and math education majors through exceptional learning techniques, materials, and activities; (2) to establish collaboration with the local magnet high school and two universities for professional development of high school and college faculty; and (3) to create an effective learning atmosphere with a calculus lab/classroom equipped with Maple software, presentation equipment and software, and workstations arranged so that students can work in pairs and/or groups of four on collaborative activities with or without the assistance of technology.\r\n\r\nActivities consist of the following: (1) focusing on two sections of Calculus I each semester, with classes meeting at least once a week in the calculus lab/classroom and making the lab accessible for completing or enhancing assignments outside of class; (2) faculty development with Duke University and the University of Alabama consultants, adapting and implementing calculus \"reform\" activities and effective use of Maple software; (3) collaboration with Litchfield High School, a local magnet school, in the development of effective materials, techniques, and activities and by hosting a summer calculus enrichment program for incoming Litchfield graduates in pre-calculus and calculus.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
