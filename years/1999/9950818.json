 "awd_abstract_narration": "The curriculum at our institution provides a foundation for the traditional chemistry degree and a fundamental physical science background for students in a wide array of majors.  This work focuses on increasing student exposure to modern analytical instrumentation via the quantitative analysis laboratory, an entry-level course in applied chemistry for non-chemistry scientists, and through outreach activities involving students in grades 4-12.  Using experiments in gas chromatography (GC) and atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), students gain experience in hands-on instrument operation and data analysis. Experiments are designed as problem based or discovery investigations into applications students encounter, based on their academic interests.  As modern instrumental methods are introduced, fundamental analytical principals are continually stressed.  Of particular interest is the exposure of pre-service teachers to modern analytical instrumentation.  This exposure enhances their ability to answer complex questions from students in discussing current events in which chemical analyses are reported.  Additional benefits for chemistry majors occurs in subsequent semesters when students undertake senior-level research projects.  Non-chemistry majors gain experience that allows them to evaluate and make decisions based on the interpretation of analytical data.  Integration of experiments demonstrating the contributions of female scientists is used to enhance the learning experiences for all students.",
