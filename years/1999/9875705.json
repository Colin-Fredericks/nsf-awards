(2) Train present and future engineers/scientists in the new emerging technologies by developing courses in ANNS, their applications, and their implementations (digital and analog VLSI, and optical); an parallel distributed architectures/systems. Research development will be continually integrated into the curriculum. WWW and state-of-the-art multimedia tools will also be incorporated. (3) Provide a bridge at the ANN architecture level, between the current strengths of the EE and Industrial Engineering Department in VLSI hardware implementation, robust, fault tolerant control and intelligent systems, respectively. (4) Expand industrial partnership (both under the auspices of the recently created Engineering. School-wide Center for Intelligent Systems as well as through individual initiative) to increase the practical relevance of the research.\r\nNeural or connectionist computation is an emerging technology with a variety of potential application such as classification, estimation, control, etc. As ANNs mature into commercial systems, they are likely to be implemented in hardware. Their fault tolerance and reliability are therefore vital to the functioning of the system in which they are embedded. Due to their similarity with biological systems, the fault tolerance properties of ANNs have been taken for granted or treated as a subsidiary issue. However, the PI's prior research demonstrates that the fault tolerance of ANNs comes at the cost of significant amount of redundancy. Furthermore, merely providing redundancy is not enough; better learning algorithms and synthesis methods must be developed in order to achieve a satisfactory fault tolerance. Also fault tolerance is closely related to generalization, which is in turn connected with the complexity of the task at hand. Despite the close connection, which is in mm connected between these attributes, they have been analyzed separately for the most part a in previous work. This project develops a new, more unified approach.\r\n",
