The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Michael R. Williams with twelve months of support to work with Dr. Luis Antonio Martinelli at the University of Sao Paulo, CENA, in Brazil.  Support for this project is provided by the U.S.-Brazil Program.\r\nDr. Williams will be investigating the effects of land-use change on atmospheric deposition and nutrient cycling via throughfall (the precipitation that passes through the canopy of trees) in the Amazon basin.  Results from this work will increase our understanding of the chemistry of this tropical rainforest, which is one of the least understood biomes of the world. This research is critical to show how habitat destruction changes ecosystem function in the Amazon.\r\nScientists at CENA and the University of Washington are working on complementary research, on the biogeochemical dynamics in rivers and catchments.  Numerous collaborations will be forged, in addition to the one with Dr. Martinelli.\r\n***\r\n",
