The project will test Massey's theory that a migrant flow between two countries tends to become self-sustaining independent of the original structural factors that initiated the flow.  Using information about Japan's economic rise and decline, eliciting qualitative as well as statistical data on labor migration, the student will test the hypothesis that the more recently a Brazilian migrant arrived in Japan, the more independent of structural factors in both sending and receiving countries was in their decision to migrate.  The student will construct a sample of 100 Brazilian residents of the Nagoya area, stratified by date of arrival in Japan.  Semi-structured interviews on their migration history will be complemented by archival data on both Japan's and Brazil's economic situation over the period of the study.  The study will serve as a valuable test of the theory, and will lead to a better understanding of some of the limitations and unintended consequences of immigration policy in an increasingly transnational world.  In addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important area of the world. \r\n",
