In practice,\r\nthere are generally many ways of describing or constructing shift\r\nsystems that have essentially the same dynamical behaviour.  Even in\r\nthe one-dimensional case, effectively recognizing when two concrete\r\nmodels are equivalent is a fundamental open problem.  Another natural\r\nand related problem is to study the different equivalencies or\r\nsymmetries between two systems.  Symmetries of a given system are\r\noften called reversible cellular automata.  One approach to the\r\nclassification and symmetry group problems for one-dimensional shift\r\nsystems that has been fruitful involves strong shift equivalence\r\ntheory.  In recent years, this has led to progress on the Shift\r\nEquivalence Problem.  This is a tantalizing question in symbolic\r\ndynamics that can be posed in elementary terms using matrices and\r\ngraphs and that has been open since since 1974.  It has led to a new\r\ntype of positive algebraic K-theory for ordered rings by way of the\r\nusual row and column operations on matrices but with certain\r\ninequalities imposed.\r\n     Strong shift equivalence theory is a combination of algebra and\r\ntopology that grew out of the dynamics of systems known as shift\r\nsystems and their symmetry groups.  It turns out to have unexpected\r\nand interesting connections with areas of mathematics outside\r\ndynamics, such as algebraic K-theory, cyclic homology, and topological\r\nquantum field theory.  Wagoner will continue to explore these new\r\ndevelopments.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
