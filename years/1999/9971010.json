This is a rich area of research</DIV> with applications to a great many problems in science and</DIV> engineering. In particular, one area of interest in the project is the large class of inverse problems involving</DIV> moments. For instance, the problem of reconstructing the shape of a</DIV> planar region given its moments is a challenging mathematical and</DIV> numerical problem, with applications in computed tomography,</DIV> geophysical prospecting, and thermal imaging, to name just a few.</DIV>\r\nGenerally, the solution of (ill-posed) inverse problems</DIV> requires the use of advanced computational techniques. For instance,</DIV> the efficient solution of linear and nonlinear least squares problems,</DIV> and the concept of regularization of such problems are important in many </DIV>applications. It is widely recognized that the choice of a</DIV> regularizing functional and the regularization parameters are both</DIV> central to the success of a stable numerical inversion approach. The</DIV> project is concerned with the numerically stable solution</DIV> of ill-posed inverse problems, particularly those involving</DIV> moments. A specific problem is that of recovering a 2-dimensional</DIV> shape from its moments, involving </DIV>(1) formulation and solution of regularized inversion schemes for the</DIV> reconstruction of shape from moments, and (2) applying these</DIV> algorithms to the reconstruction of gravitational anomalies from</DIV> measurements of gravitational fields\r\n",
