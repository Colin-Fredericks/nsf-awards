The general format will be to build\r\neach of the three-day conferences around four one-hour lectures by\r\ndistinguished set theorists and to round out the program with shorter talks\r\ncontributed by those attracted to the featured speakers.  This strategy has\r\nbeen successful in the past---the series of conferences began in 1992---and\r\nparticipants are widely representative of set theoretic research across\r\nthe U.S. and Canada, with increasing participation from countries\r\noverseas.  Participation by younger mathematicians, by women, and by\r\nunderrepresented minorities has been encouraged.  The talks are held in\r\nbarrier free classrooms at Boise State University, and efforts are made\r\nto accommodate special needs among the roughly twenty annual participants.\r\nThe host institution provides office support and secretarial facilities\r\nwithout cost to the participants or to the government.\r\n***\r\n",
