 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860470\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at developing a vibration mixer for the mixing of surgical grade bone cement. Self-curing poly(methyl methacrylate (PMMA) or acrylic bone cement is used extensively in total joint replacements, in the repair of bony defects and in the fixation of pathological fractures. For surgical use, the methylmethacrylate polymer and the liquid monomer are hand mixed. This hand mixing entraps air bubbles making the cement porous. Presence of these bubbles adversely affects the mechanical properties of bone cement, making it much weaker under load. The objective of this project will be: (1) to determine if a similar technique could also be used to reduce the porosity in bone cement; ( 2) to evaluate the resulting improvement in its mechanical properties;  and (3 ) to design a vibration apparatus to obtain the maximum improvement in the strength properties of bone cement..\r\n     Results of our preliminary study indicate that bone cement in the liquid state, when subjected to ultrasonic vibration, showed increased static compressive and tensile strength, as compared to normal bone cement. During this phase of the project, we plan to optimize the vibration parameters, namely, amplitude and frequency to achieve maximum consolidation and, thus, obtain significantly high strength properties of the bone cement. Subsequently, a mixer with these specifications will be designed in collaboration with a manufacturer of shaker tables and will be marketed for mixing bone cement.  Presently centrifuge and vacuum mixed are available for mixing bone cement, but these methods have lost favor with the orthopaedic surgeons. It is expected that the improved mechanical properties of bone cement obtained through the use of a vibration mixer will prolong the long-term survival rate of total joint replacements.\r\n",
