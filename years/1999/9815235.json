Placodonts were restricted to the western Tethyan faunal province.  Their fossils are found today in Central Europe and circum-mediterranean countries.  The first appearance of placodonts is correlated with a Lower Triassic sea-level rise that created the habitats where the group eventually diversified.  The group went extinct in the aftermath of a Late Triassic drop in sea level. Although two separate groups of placodonts have previously been recognized, the \"unarmored\" (Placodontoidea) and the \"armored\" (Cyamdontoidea) placodonts, the relationships within the groups remain poorly understood.  An improved understanding of the history of placodonts may have important consequences for understanding higher level relationships among reptiles as a whole.  It will also provide the necessary background for improved insight on the functional anatomy of the feeding system among members of the group.  Understanding the historical biogeographic relationships among placodonts will in turn improve understanding of the complex geological history of the region they inhabited.\r\n",
