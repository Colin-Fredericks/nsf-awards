In  the  past  two  decades,  leading  to powerful formalisms such as H-infinity, mu-synthesis/analysis and, more recently, L-1 optimal control, that have been successfully applied to challenging practical problems.  In contrast,  practical tools for handling linear parameter varying plants have just emerged and are  still  far  from  complete.  Among  others,  issues  yet  to  be resolved include non-conservative handling of multiple performance specifications,  complexity  of  both  the  design  method  and  the resulting  controllers,  and  the  development  of  identification methods  compatible  with  these  design  techniques.  The  proposed research is aimed at removing these limitations by incorporating into the LPV framework the capability to deal exactly with a broad class  of  performance  specifications  and  model  uncertainty.  Specifically, the objectives of the proposed research are:\r\n\r\nDevelopment of tools  for robust  identification and model validation of LPV systems.\r\n\r\nDevelopment  of  an  analytical  framework  for  synthesizing robust multiobjective LPV systems. This framework will:\r\n(a)\tHandle multiple performance specifications in a non-conservative fashion;\r\n(b)\tIdentify the intrinsic limits  of performance of the system as well as the limiting factors; and\r\n(c)\tAddress the issue of controller complexity.\r\n\r\nApplication of the resulting theory to the synthesis of robust controllers  for  active  vision  systems  and  experimental validation using a Bisight robotic head and dedicated image processing hardware.\r\n\r\nThe  proposed  research  will  combine  elements  from  functional analysis  and viability theory,  successfully used by the  PI  to solve multiobjective  robust identification and control problems for LTI plants.  Preliminary results show that this combination has the  potential  to  address,  in  a  unified  framework,  both  the identification and synthesis aspects of the problem.\r\nThis  research effort will  result in an expanded robust  control framework  for  LPV  systems,  capable  of  addressing  realistic problems necessitating neither potentially conservative approxi-mations nor multiple trial and error type iterations. Moreover, in addition to advancing the state of the art in control theory, we expect  that  by  removing  some  of  the  limitations  of  currently available LPV tools, it will foster progress in related areas.  An example  is  computer vision,  an area where  recent technological advances  have  rendered  a  number  of  practical  applications feasible,  provided that  certain  related  control  issues  can be resolved.  These  applications  range  from  intelligent  highway systems to remote surgery and have the potential to broadly impact society.  \r\n***   \r\n   \r\n\r\n",
