Richmond  in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon.   The ten participants, recruited nationally, will take part in an extremely successful program that encourages undergraduate Chemistry and Physics majors to pursue graduate degrees in chemical physics/physical chemistry.  Students are selected based on a strong background in both chemistry and physics and their desire to combine the two disciplines in their future career work.  Twelve research faculty from the chemistry and physics departments will be involved in the Site.  in addition to the research, the students and supervisors will participate in a collective program which includes research seminars, weekly meetings, social activities and follow-up activities after students return to their home institutions.",
