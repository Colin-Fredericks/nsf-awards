 "awd_abstract_narration": "Labeling of live cells with low energy beta-emitting radioisotopes such as 35S-methionine and 3H-thymidine is often used to follow the biosynthesis and modification of proteins in cells or to monitor cell proliferation.  Such metabolic labeling is a widely used technique that has been generally assumed to be non-perturbing to cells.  However, other forms of radiation, such as gamma, ultraviolet, and x-irradiation, can have harmful effects on cells ranging from arrest of cell growth to cell death.  The overall goal of this project is to investigate more fully the effects of radiolabeling with low level beta-emitters on cell cycle progression and survival, focusing on the molecular targets and mechanisms of radioisotope-mediated radiation damage.  Preliminary studies from this laboratory have shown that even a brief two-hour labeling with 35S-methionine causes cell cycle arrest, inhibits cell proliferation, alters cell morphology, and induces cell death (apoptosis) over the course of several days.  Additional studies will test the following hypotheses:  (1) that low doses of beta-emitting radioisotopes inhibit the cell cycle and cause apoptosis in a manner that is cell type-specific and dependent in part on the energy of the beta-emitter, (2) that inhibition of the cell cycle involves direct or indirect inactivation of the control machinery for the cell cycle, and (3) that radiotoxicity involves DNA damage or oxidative stress.  Cell cycle analyses will be performed on a variety of cell types labeled with 3H-thymidine, 35S-methionine, or 32P-orthophosphate in time and dose-dependent studies.  The levels and phosphorylated states of cell cycle control components, including p53, p21, and cdc2, will be evaluated.  Other assays will be used to monitor cell viability, the induction of apoptosis, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and the long-term survival and mitotic potential of cells.  The widespread use of these radioisotopes to track protein synthesis and cell proliferation necessitates a thorough examination of their effects.  If it can be definitively shown that common metabolic labeling techniques induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or DNA damage, the techniques themselves as well as information based on these techniques will need to be reevaluated.  Aside from the impact on experimental design, results might also suggest the need to reevaluate acceptable exposure levels to these radioisotopes in the laboratory, workplace and environment.\r\n\r\n",
