 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project, endorsed by the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS), will be the eighth CBMS survey of undergraduate mathematics education in the United States.  As in past years, the survey will report on curricular, enrollment, and personnel issues in undergraduate mathematics, creating a longitudinal data base of information not available anywhere else.  Publications from these surveys have assisted governmental and academic administrators as they make resource allocation decisions, have assisted the mathematical community in understanding the curricular and personnel problems that it faces, and have served as a data source for almost every national report on the mathematical sciences community.\r\n\r\nCBMS2000, as the survey is called, will include more than 600 of the 2,500 U. S. departments of mathematical sciences (broadly defined) in two-and four-year institutions.  The impact of calculus reform, the teaching of statistics in mathematics departments, and the pre-service education of K-12 mathematics teachers are likely to be among special focus areas.\r\n\r\nChanges from earlier surveys will include a greater emphasis on undergraduate statistical education, enhanced parellelism between the two-year and four-year college questionnaires, the use of a university statistical laboratory to carry out the analysis of survey data, and wider dissemination of the final report to federal decisionmakers.  The entire report will be made available for electronic dissemination through the internet.",
