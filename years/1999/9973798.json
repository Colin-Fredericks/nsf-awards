 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the applicability of phytoremediation to the treatment of wastewaters containing alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEO's), widely used nonionic surfactants, and to determine how these compounds are transported and degraded in a plant-based sytem.  Plant species and plant systems best adapted for the degradation of alkylphenolic compounds will be identified and evaluated in controlled laboratory and greenhouse experiments.  Batch and flow-through systems will be used to measure and elucidate the mechanisms of contaminant removal by phytoremediation.  Collaborative relationships will be established with researchers and designers of plant-based treatment systems and the results of this phytoremediation research will be integrated into a senior/graduate level course on biological treatment processes.  With the support of this POWRE grant, the investigator will develop this new area of research and collaboration during a year of sabbatical leave. \r\n\r\n",
