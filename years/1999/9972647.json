 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972647\r\nBaum and Hileman\r\n\r\n\t Recent studies focusing on model plant systems including the snapdragon Antirrhinum majus (family Scrophulariaceae) have identified individual genes affecting flower development, floral shape, and floral parts.  Graduate student Lena Hileman, under the direction of Dr. David Baum at Harvard University, is investigating close relatives of the snapdragon in the genera Mohavea and Sairocarpus, to construct a molecular phylogeny of the species (mostly based on chloroplast ndhF sequences) in order to explore evolutionary changes in the floral development genes. The specific aim is to determine the genes that cause Mohavea flowers to have only two stamens as opposed to the four produced by snapdragon flowers.  The search for the genetic basis of this difference is facilitated because a gene influencing stamen abortion, CYCLOIDEA (CYC), has been characterized in snapdragon.  In snapdragon, CYC is expressed in one of the five stamen primordia and results in that stamen aborting (leaving four stamens to mature). Expression of CYC-like genes in the tetraploid Mohavea (where there may be multiple copies) will be studied in tissue preparations to see if these genes are expressed in early stages of the three aborted stamens. The work constitutes a fine-scale genetic dissection of the developmental control of floral characters used in the species- and genus-level classification of Scrophulariaceae plants. \r\n\tBecause plants of Mohavea are tetraploid (contain two complete genomes), they are expected to possess two copies of CYC and two copies of a closely related gene, DICHOTOMA (DICH). The project will include DNA sequencing of the members of the CYC/DICH gene family in order to provide information regarding molecular evolutionary changes in this gene family. Preliminary work has already identified four potential gene products, thus providing material for sequence analysis to determine whether some of the genes have been subject to stronger natural selection (as indicated by reduced rates of molecular evolution). By combining a detailed understanding of the selective history of these genes with studies of gene expression patterns, we will learn about the fate of duplicate genes during genome evolution and their role in morphological diversification.\r\n\r\n",
