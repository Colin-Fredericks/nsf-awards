 "awd_abstract_narration": "9977193\r\nBurns\r\n\r\nFunds from the Major Research Instrumentation program will be used to acquire x-ray diffraction instrumentation consisting of an analytic materials research grade diffractometer fitted with primary beam optics and a lower resolution diffractometer outfitted with a dual furnace-cryostat attachment and a grazing incidence thin-film stage.  This x-ray instrumentation will be used to characterize advanced imaging materials, including optical and electronic materials, thin films, coatings, and surface-polished or ground crystalline materials. The diffractometers are the Philips Materials Research Diffractometer and Multi-Purpose Diffractometer instruments.  A materials research diffractometer with a very high resolution, horizontal goniometer and a heavy duty Eulerian cradle with capability for texture analysis, high-angle residual-stress analysis, layered and in-plane MBE strain and structure analysis are proposed.  The key aspect of this equipment will be the capability to obtain structure sensitive data on thin-films, MBE layers, residual-stresses, ground and polished crystalline surfaces and texture analyses which can not be conducted at the University of Rochester today because of lack of instrumentation.  Data obtained from these analyses is essential for understanding and controlling the microstructure, properties and performance of existing materials and to design new materials and processes.  The research conducted on this instrument will be performed by investigators in several departments.  Students working on these project will be exposed to cutting-edge research in materials of great technological importance.\r\n\r\nX-ray diffraction instrumentation for materials research will be acquired with funds from the Major Research Instrumentation program.  The impact on the research infrastructure at the University of Rochester will be great not only on the types of projects that will use the instrument, but also on the research training of students on this state-of-the-art system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
