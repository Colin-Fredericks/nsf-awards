One of the most widely studied interactions is predation, however the effect of predation on community structure is not well known. This study will compare the effects of ecological characteristics of predators and their prey assemblages on interaction strength. This will be done using two experiments. One experiment is designed to compare the effects of predators representing different taxonomies, foraging microhabitats and patterns of resource use (size of prey consumed) on a common prey assemblage. The second experiment is setup to determine if the keystone effect of a predator is dependent upon the relative abundances or degree of competitive asymmetry in the prey assemblage. This work should lead to a better understanding of what controls the strength of interactions between species, thus, leading to the development of theories predicting the structure of local communities.\r\n",
