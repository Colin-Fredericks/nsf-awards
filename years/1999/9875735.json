 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Nelson's research explores catalytic, asymmetric cyano group transfer reactions.  The paradigm within which this is being developed is that of the Meerwein-Pondorf-Veerly hydride transfer reaction, where acetone cyanohydrin serves in place of the secondary alcohol component.  Further development of the cyano variant of this reaction will result from elaboration of the cyano group.  In this way, an asymmetric Strecker process is possible.  Other possible targets include complex polyol fragments of such molecules as the antioncogenic agent pancristatin.  Development of effective catalysts for the reaction is a corollary goal, and will be pursued using combinatory screening methods and the development of a ligand library.  Professor Nelson's educational activities are targeted at the development of science instructors among the chemistry student cohort.  Students will design and implement lesson plans and laboratory exercises, to provide a mechanism for creating or perpetuating an interest among science majors in exploring a career in science education.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the teaching and research of Dr. Scott G. Nelson of the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Nelson will employ the cyano group in its relatively safe acetone cyanohydrin form to carry out a variety of metal-catalyzed reactions that will result in such useful substances as amino acid analogues.  More complex targets are also being targeted, such as the anticancer compound pancristatin.  Professor Nelson's educational goals center on inspiring undergraduate science majors to opt for careers as science teachers.  Specifically, Dr. Nelson will give these students the opportunity to be involved in the design of new laboratory experiments.  This is intended as a teaching alternative for the traditional undergraduate laboratory research opportunity.\r\n",
