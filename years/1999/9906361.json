 "awd_abstract_narration": "9906361\r\nDuke\r\n\r\nThis award provides critical funding needed to complete modernization of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) laboratory at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.  In July 1999 the energy-dispersive X-ray detector on the SEM will be replaced with a new light-element detector and microanalysis system funded with institutional and laboratory resources.  The additional funding provided by this NSF grant will be used to add advanced chemical and morphological image analysis software and to replace the existing backscattered electron detector with a new TV-rate detector.  The upgraded SEM will combine state-of-the-art capabilities in imaging, X-ray microanalysis, and compositional and morphological image processing.\r\nThe new analytical and imaging capabilities will benefit basic and applied geoscience research in the following areas:  petrologic evolution of granites and pegmatites;  element redistribution during metamorphism; spectroscopic properties of rocks and minerals;  genesis of hydrothermal ore deposits;  systematics of marine and terrestrial vertebrate fossils;  fluid dynamics of wind-blown dust;  and applied geological remote sensing.  The principal benefits will derive from the efficiency of the new backscattered electron detector for examination of polished petrologic thin sections, the ability to generate mineral maps or modal analyses based on X-ray or backscattered electron signals, and the capability for rapid chemical and morphological characterization and classification of particles.  These improvements to the SEM facility are considered critical to the research and training activities in geology and geological engineering at SDSM&T.  Moreover, the SEM facility serves the entire campus and many important interdisciplinary research projects have been initiated in the laboratory.  Consequently, the improvements resulting from this award will have a broad impact on faculty and students throughout the university.  \r\n\r\n***\r\n",
