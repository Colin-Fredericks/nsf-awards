The products delivered to the stations will include 90-second video news stories in two versions -- with and without voice-over; scripts that local newscasters can read on air; topical and regional tips sheets to help producers localize the stories;  follow-up research and one-on-one support by the project staff; explanatory or science-angle sidebars; web stories to introduce upcoming TV stories and provide more in-depth coverage; and Internet support with resources important to local TV producers.   The project also provides content to the abcnews.com science site and to ABC News One, the network affiliate news service.  The science modules will produce segments in both English and Spanish. \r\n\r\nThe PI and General Manager for the project is Eliene Augenbraun, a former research scientist with experience in management and media.  The News Director and Co-PI is Ira Flatow.  They will work with an advisory committee of scientists and science journalists.\r\n\r\n",
