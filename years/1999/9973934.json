 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film deposition by reactive magnetron sputtering, with emphasis on the role of energy and momentum flux into the surface during growth in determining film properties. The plasma density and ion energy at the substrate will be systematically varied using magnetron unbalancing and an external magnetic field and radio frequency bias. The plasma characteristics will be assessed using standard plasma probes. Monte Carlo simulations of sputter atom transport will be used to study the nature, energy, and flux of energetic neutral bombardment. These data will be correlated with compositional, structural, optical, and electrical properties of the resulting ZnO films as determined by Rutherford Back Scattering, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, conductivity and Hall effect, and transmission and reflection spectroscopy. The research is expected to elucidate specific chemical and physical effects of energy-/momentum flux on ZnO thin film growth and thereby provide a sound scientific basis for further optimization of this technologically important material. \r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having potential technological relevance. Zinc oxide is an important transparent conducting material that finds extensive application in photovoltaic cells, flat panel displays, and other thin film technologies. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level which will be relevant to performance of advanced applications of this type in electronics/photonics. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. The project will be carried out in collaboration with undergraduate research assistants, providing valuable research training and experience for future scientists and engineers, as well as enhancing the research environment of Macalester College, an undergraduate-only institution.  \r\n*** \r\n",
