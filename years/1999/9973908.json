In addition, a multidisciplinary research training program and graduate curriculum in organic nonlinear optics will be initiated through this effort. Current research involves fabricating waveguides using chromophore-doped polymers followed by electric field poling. A new effort is initiated to fabricate these waveguides by ionic self assembly. Planar waveguide structures have been grown by a modified technique developed by the PI's students. This approach will be used to design optical fiber devices for frequency conversion by creating a nonlinear cladding with ISAMs. To the knowledge of the PI, this idea has not been reported in the literature. The idea of producing a nonlinear fiber cladding rather than core has not been developed to any great extent. The PI knows of only one other attempt (in 1988) using Langmuir-Blodgett films. This project will be used as a means for the PI to develop relevant multidisciplinary research training in organic chemistry and materials science. This training will allow her to supervise her students more effectively and to develop a multidisciplinary graduate program involving Electrical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, and Materials Science. A POWRE award would be important for revitalizing the PI's research program and extend it to new areas. The research program of the PI has been affected in recent years by significant personal events.\r\n",
