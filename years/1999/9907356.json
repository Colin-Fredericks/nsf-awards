 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researchers will continue to provide the US component to the International Tundra EXperiment (ITEX).  ITEX uses a very simple experiment throughout the Arctic to examine the potential effects of global warming on Arctic tundra.  Small open-topped plexiglass cones are placed on the tundra to cause a 2-4 degree warming similar to that predicted for atmospheric temperatures in response to a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from increased emission of greenhouse gases.  Botanical variables are measured within and outside the cones to determine effects caused by the induced warming.  The relationship of the changes in the tundra produced by the manipulative heating experiment are used to predict future change occurring in response to global warming.  The US research component of conducts a research program at Toolik Lake, Atqasuk, and Barrow Alaska and at one site in Canada in conjunction with Canadian researchers.  The results of the ITEX Project are very important for reliable forecasts of the response of Arctic tundra to global warming.  Those forecasts are critical to understanding the role of the Arctic in the global carbon cycle and the sustainability of natural resources in response to global change.",
