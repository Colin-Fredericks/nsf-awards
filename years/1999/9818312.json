The objective of the research is to develop accurate time-delay systems in order to improve system performance and reliability of analysis.  They will study problems related to deterministic systems, including the extension, combination and simplification of recently developed stability and performance theory.  In addition, they will apply robust stochastic control design theory and statistical learning methodology to time-delay systems.  The results will be implemented as a computer aided control systems design package for time-delay systems which could be applied to traffic control problems and to remote feedback control for stabilization of large-scale power systems.  The collaboration takes advantage of the complementary expertise of the US and French investigators.\r\n\r\n",
