As a physiologist with a research focus on signal transduction in the ovary, this investigator would like to not only be a part, but a leader in that revolution.  In order to achieve that goal, this investigator needs to acquire more training and experience in sophisticated molecular techniques.  Thus, the objective of this POWRE proposal is to obtain training in molecular biology that will allow this investigator to apply the concepts and techniques of physiological genomics to her research in signal transduction in the ovary.  The POWRE activities will occur in three phases: (1) Attendance at the New England Biolabs Molecular Biology and PCR Summer Workshop; (2) Application and strengthening of skills in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, gene mutation, and transfection of mammalian cells in the laboratory of Dr. Wendy Maury on site at the University of South Dakota; and, (3) Further experience in gene expression and regulation in the laboratory of Dr. David Olson at the University of Alberta.  The skills that this investigator will learn during the POWRE project will form the foundation for a regular research proposal which will be submitted during the tenure of the POWRE proposal and which will take a physiological genomics approach to the problem of understanding signal transduction in the ovary.  For example, one aspect of the regular research proposal will examine the temporal relationship of expression of signal transduction circuits in the ovary and correlate gene expression with the functional status of the ovaries.  This project will advance the principal investigator into a leadership role in the field of physiological genomics in the ovary.  It is therefore suitable for the POWRE program since the objective of the POWRE program is to increase the prominence, visibility, and influence of women in all fields of academic science and engineering supported by NSF.\r\n",
