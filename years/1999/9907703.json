 "awd_abstract_narration": "\t\t\t\r\nThe Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is an independent, nonprofit field station with no institutional affiliation, which provides facilities for researchers and students who wish to study high-altitude biology in a field setting.  Over the past ten years, the RMBL has conducted an orderly series of improvements to housing and research facilities that follow recommendations of the 1989 Master Plan (revised in 1995) and Internal (1996) and External (1997) Reviews.  Over the next few years the RMBL is embarking on an ambitious program of renovating facilities used primarily by students and  visiting scientists.  This project will support the building of a new washhouse and relocate five vaulted outhouses in compliance with Gunnison County Sewage Disposal regulations and the renovation of the existing washhouse into graduate student housing.\r\n\r\nThe outhouses will consist of sealed plastic vaults that will prevent leakage of human waste into groundwater.  The vaults can be readily pumped on a regular basis.  In turn, RMBL plans to close down several public flush toilets.  When complete, RMBL will be in compliance with county regulations and will protect its   'in-stream' water rights in the East River and Copper Creek by maintaining water quality of these streams.  The existing washhouse will be renovated to provide high-quality, non-cooking graduate student housing and study space.  All hardware for solar hot water heating in the existing washhouse will be used in the new washhouse helping to hold the cost of the new washhouse to a minimum. \r\n",
