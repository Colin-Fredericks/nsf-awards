For example, a priori the population means or some of the population quantiles for these auxiliary variables could be known.  Classical theory has developed a variety of methods to exploit this information with different levels of overall effectiveness.  The Polya posterior was developed as a noninformative Bayesian approach to finite population sampling when little or no prior information is available.  The goal of the proposed research is to extend the Polya posterior to problems where auxiliary variables are present.  This will be done by restricting the Polya posterior in a natural way so that given a sample simulated copies of the entire population can be generated which satisfy the constraints induced by the prior knowledge about the auxiliary variables.  Statistical inference can then be carried out using the simulated populations in the usual Bayesian manner. The two main technical problems will be to develop the underlying theory and the techniques for implementing the simulations which are consistent with the prior information at hand. This allows for a coherent approach to problems which standard theory must now consider individually.  Several problems will be identified were certain types of prior information which are often presently ignored can be used in an objective and effective way.  The resulting noninformative Bayesian procedures should have good frequentist properties.\r\n\r\nA fundamental problem of statistics is making inferences about a population when information is available only about a sample or subset of the individuals making up the population.  For example, we may want to estimate how many days a typical worker is absent because of illness during a year in a given industry.  In addition to the information in the sample, we may also know the average age or median education level for all the workers in the industry.  Statisticians have developed various methods to handle such problems depending on what kind of information beyond the sample is at hand.  Some methods work much better than others. In this research we will study a general approach which can effectively make use of a variety of types of information. This is done by using the data in the sample and the prior information to construct simulated or random copies of the entire population which are consistent with both the sample data and the prior information.  By considering the variability among these randomly generated copies of the population one can find not only an estimate of the quantity of interest but a measure of uncertainty associated with the estimate. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
