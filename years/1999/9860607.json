 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860607\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop thin-film NOX sensors based on novel binary-phased nanocomposites by sol-gel processing. Such sensors are expected to show greatly (non-additively) enhanced sensitivity to both NO and NO2, while interference from other gases may be minimized. The long-term stability of the sensor performance may also be improved due to the increased stability of the sensing materials in the binary-phased structure. Sol-gel offers many advantages as a processing technique for sensor fabrication, which include, in particular, the facility and versatility for nanoengineering of the microstructure. These thin-film sensors can be readily incorporated with silicon micro-electronic technology and naturally allow for miniaturization, low process costs, and high reproducibility.\r\n     Reliable compact solid-state chemical sensors are urgently needed. This innovation is expected to result in highly stable and sensitive thin-film NOx sensors for automotive emission control, industrial processing control, and environmental monitoring. These sensors may be used as standalone sensing devices or as sensing units to be integrated into on-chip multi-functional sensors and smart structures.\r\n",
