 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental engineering is evolving from a field primarily concerned with municipal water supply, wastewater treatment processes, and end-of-pipe treatment of industrial wastewater discharges to one with broader concerns. The field now encompasses air pollution concerns more than at any previous time and the end-of-pipe mentality for industrial wastes is being supplemented by pollution reduction at the process level. Our education of undergraduate students in environmental engineering needs to change to reflect these advances in the field.   \r\n\r\nThis project adapts and updates the water chemistry approach and laboratory exercises available in existing published materials and which had been implemented previously at the University of Maine and University of Michigan.  This implementation will add the consideration of  measurements in other media (air, soil), and add more practical engineering experiences to enhance student learning.\r\n\r\nOur undergraduate curriculum includes a class on Environmental Sampling and Analysis. For many years, this class has remained essentially unchanged-a strong laboratory class devoted to learning the standard measurement techniques for the common constituents of concern in municipal drinking water and wastewater treatment. The emphasis on measurement techniques has been on manual, wet chemistry methods of analysis.  This class is being revised to (i) improve the students' understanding of the relationship between manufacturing processes and environmental protection, (ii) broaden the type of samples to include air and soil samples, and (iii) enhance the student's understanding of modern instrumental methods of environmental analysis.\r\n\r\nThe revamping of this course requires a substantial commitment of human and financial resources. Four faculty members, three of whom have previously taught this class, are involved, and a review team of three external faculty members has been assembled. New equipment is to being purchased to accomplish the objectives.  The materials developed for this class are being disseminated broadly, primarily through the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors, an organization with a history of sharing resources for laboratory-based courses.\r\n",
