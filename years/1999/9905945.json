 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will clarify the conceptualization of agroecology, as practiced in Latin America, as an alternative approach to biotechnology in the development of agricultural knowledge.   It also will review the literatures on ethics and biotechnology, and on its political and sociological aspects, in order to inform an analysis of ethical issues associated with scientific choices for agricultural development.   The longer term project has as its goal a book on competing moral and social values in the adoption of biotechnology or agroecology as a development strategy.  The project will explore the strategies of the research programs of biotechnology and agroecology and their interactions respectively with the values of mainstream development programs and policies and with those of movements aiming for grassroots empowerment.  By discussing some perplexing ethical problems that have arisen in connection with recent biotechnological applications, the analysis will underline the importance of appraising the prospects for more widespread adoption in agriculture of alternatives such as agroecology, and question the view that advances in biotechnology uniquely provide the key to feeding the world's rapidly expanding population. It will examine the merits of competing conceptions of \"development\" and the values implicit in them (with a focus on Latin American discussions), and  investigate which approaches to scientific inquiry best serve the development of the impoverished majorities of \"third world\" countries. The value of agroecology and its associated approaches to scientific inquiry (provided that their sound empirical credentials can be confirmed) will be defended.",
