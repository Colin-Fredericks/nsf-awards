Fundamental investigations of the magnetization reversal process in nanostructured magnetic materials, such as thin films, are relevant to information storage densities in the films and to the basic read/write operation. This project will employ ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and other techniques to study the influence of film morphology on  the dynamics of domain wall motion, a major factor in the read/write process. Of interest is the role of the anisotropy energy on the wall structure, especially on the Neel cap regions of the domain wall. A picosecond strobe laser beam and magneto-optic Kerr effect spectrometer will also be used to investigate the domain wall mobility in cobalt films and wires. The project provides excellent training for graduate students in areas of fundamental physics and in areas of technical magnetism relevant to the information storage industry. Students also benefit from the use of state-of-the art instruments and techniques employed in the experiments.\r\n%%%\r\nThis project will pursue fundamental investigations of the physics of magnetization reversal processes in nano-structured magnetic materials. The studies will investigate processes that are important in the context of materials employed in the information storage technology arena. A primary area of interest is the magnetization reversal dynamics in thin metal films. This is a critical factor in information storage densities and read/write operations in next-generation computers. The experiments employ magnetic resonance, laser probes, and magneto-optic Kerr effects instrumentation. The training that students and post-doctoral research scientists receive while working on the experiments will prepare them for cutting edge materials and device related careers in industry, academe, or government.\r\n",
