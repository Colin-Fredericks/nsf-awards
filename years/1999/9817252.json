 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contrary to dogma, the adult brain exhibits considerable plasticity. New\r\ncells which are born in particular regions migrate within the forebrain and\r\ndifferentiate into neurons. The investigator has found that the birth, survival, and/or\r\ndifferentiation of such cells in adult brains is influenced by both\r\nenvironmental and hormonal factors.  His work will clarify the cellular and\r\nphysiological mechanisms which underlie the regulation of new cell\r\nincorporation and address its functional significance.\r\nDr. Bittman will first determine whether removal of the testes eliminates the\r\ninfluence of daylength on the number of newborn cells in specific brain\r\nregions, and whether fluctuations in androgen secretion are necessary for\r\ndaylength to exert its effects. This work will establish whether daylength\r\nand androgen interact to regulate this phenomenon. The investigator will next establish\r\nwhether the influences of the gonads and photoperiod on the incorporation\r\nof new neurons in adulthood are attributable to regulation of cell birth,\r\nprogrammed cell death, migration of newborn cells, or some combination of\r\nthese events. Finally, he will explore the possible functional role of\r\nneurons born in adulthood. This will be accomplished by assessing the\r\nactivation of newborn cells in the processing of reproductively relevant\r\nolfactory stimuli.\r\nThese experiments will elucidate environmental regulation of brain\r\nplasticity and explore basic mechanisms regulating cell birth, migration,\r\nand death which may prove useful in treatment of damaged or diseased\r\nnervous systems.\r\n",
