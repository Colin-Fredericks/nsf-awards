 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe research component of this project concerns developing and studying database theory and implemen-\r\ntation techniques for supporting on-line interactive time series analysis. The target application domains are\r\nthose involving a large volume of time series that are kept in a database. An on-line interactive analysis\r\nsystem allows users to observe and analyze the time series retrieved by one query and then to use the ob-\r\ntained knowledge to form the next one. Thus, the system supports an interactive access environment that is\r\nespecially useful when users only have some ' intuitive idea (which may be changing with each time series\r\nanalyzed) about what they are looking for. The key objective of this project is to provide fast response from\r\nthe system, which is obviously crucial to the success of this interactive environment. The basic strategy of\r\nthe proposed work is to provide approximation for time series, and to develop indexing and precomputa-\r\ntion techniques. The project also contains a prototyping component to build a test bed system. The results\r\nfrom this project will lead to a better understanding of, and a number of basic tools for, interactive systems\r\nsupporting time series analysis.\r\n\r\nThe education component of this project concentrates on developing courses dealing with theories and tools necessary for on-line interactive analysis, including those developed in this project. The target students are from information technology as well as computational science areas and the courses are thus interdisciplinary in nature. Science and engineering nowadays rely heavily on the ability to analyze large volumes of data, and the courses developed will directly contribute to these fields by exposing the students to the methods and techniques for interactive analysis, and helping the students to apply these tools to their fields of study. The students will also be involved directly in the research component of this project. In addition to the courses developed, several Ph.D. dissertations are expected.\r\n",
