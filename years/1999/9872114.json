 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies pattern recognition algorithms for High Energy Physics\r\n(HEP).  In particular, it looks at pattern recognition for data from HEP\r\nexperiments which requires global information and lends itself well to\r\nparallelism.  While a trivial form of parallelism has always been present\r\nin HEP software due to the independent data (results of separate high\r\nenergy collisions), there has been little done for pattern recognition\r\nwithin single events.  This is a particularly pressing problem for the next\r\ngeneration of experiments where data is taken in at rates of up to 20\r\nMbytes each 25 nanoseconds and rapid pattern recognition is essential to\r\ndecide which events should be kept for later study.  Since a single event\r\nwill leave traces in many different detectors, pattern recognition here is\r\na non-local, non-sequential pattern matching problem.\r\n\r\nOther physicists have tried to find a quick heuristic match during a single\r\npass through the data. In contrast, this project will do a more careful\r\nanalysis of the data to better resolve multiple events that are close in\r\ntime and space by using signal processing techniques (e.g. Kalman\r\nfiltering) to pre-process the data. The project will use a better\r\nalgorithmic formalism to take advantage of computer science algorithms and\r\ndata structures, and will implement parallel algorithms to recognize\r\nnon-local patterns.  Special challenges will be presented by the\r\nanticipated datasets, which have petabyte sizes.  New algorithms for these\r\napplications will have to take careful account of the different access\r\ntimes for RAM and disk access.  This project is interdisciplinary in\r\nnature, with potential impact on both computer science and high energy\r\nphysics.\r\n\r\n",
