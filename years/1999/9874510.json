 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understand mechanisms that regulate homeotic gene expression by specifying enhancer-promoter interactions, and to identify cis and trans factors participating in this regulation. The organization of homeotic genes is complex and poorly understood. For example, Antennapedia complex (ANT-C), a Drosophila HOM/HOX complex, contains five homeotic genes specifying segmental identity in the head and thoracic region, as well as six non-homeotic genes. These genes are controlled by arrays of enhancers located at varying distances. To understand how genes in such complex genetic loci are independently regulated, enhancer-promoter specificity will be determined for two neighboring genes, Scr and ftz, in ANT-C. Scr, a homeotic gene and ftz, a segmentation gene, are divergently transcribed and both are regulated by enhancers located within a 15 kb intergenic region. These enhancers specifically interact with their cognate promoters, directing distinct patterns of expression. Using a transgenic expression assay that allows monitoring of the activities of multiple promoters and enhancers in Drosophila embryos, it has been shown that promoter competition is probably an important mechanism for specific promoter-enhancer interaction for ftz and scr.  That and other experimental observations suggest that both enhancer and promoter sequences play critical roles in specifying interactions among them and that the genomic organization of HOM/HOX complexes is important for the developmental control of homeotic gene expression. The specific questions to be asked are: 1) How does the Scr promoter specifically engage its own enhancers in the presence of the highly competitive ftz promoter 2) Is promoter competition a general mechanism for transcriptional regulation in this genomic interval? 3) What are the cis and trans factors that control the competitiveness of promoter-enhancer interactions? 4) How does insulator DNA selectively modify enhancer-promoter interactions?\r\n\r\nThis study addresses a number of important issues of gene regulation in complex genetic loci and should provide insights into genetic regulatory strategies used in body pattern formation in animals including humans.\r\n",
