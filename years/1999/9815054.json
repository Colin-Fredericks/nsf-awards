 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bacteriology Collection is one of the most diversified assemblages of bacteria in the world. It currently holds close to 18,000 strains representing approximately 600 recognized genera. Approximately 20% of total strains were accessioned with NSF support (the \"NSF-supported cultures\"). In 1997, more than 19,000 vials of NSF-supported cultures were distributed in the U.S. and throughout the world. These cultures were used in a variety of applications: teaching, quality control testing, industrial production, and research. In addition, the Bacterial Collection is recognized as a repository for standard reference cultures, and the strains are listed in a number of manuals and procedures.\r\n\r\nAuthentication and quality control have been and continue to be performed at the highest standard in the Collection. The majority of the strains have been identified extensively by a suite of physiological, morphological, and cytochemical characteristics that are specific to that species. New molecular methods are being evaluated for incorporation as routine quality control procedures to achieve a polyphasic taxonomic approach in the characterization of bacterial strains.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is a continuation of NSF BIR-9512045, which supports approximately 13% of the total expenditures required-for the on-going maintenance of the Collection, and for enhancing the quality of its acquisitions. These monies will also provide partial support for the Collection to set up standardized resources for microbial authentication in the next few years.\r\n",
