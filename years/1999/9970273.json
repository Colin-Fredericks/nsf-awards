 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on two distinct but related lines of research:\r\nsingular limits of nonlinear wave equations, and the development of\r\ntheory and applications of a function space, BnV.\r\nThe former problems entail describing the asymptotic behavior of certain\r\nfamilies of nonlinear wave equations containing a small parameter.\r\nThese are mostly well-known equations from mathematical physics.\r\nSpecific problems include a number of issues related to vortex dynamics\r\nin solutions of the Gross-Pitaevsky equation, for example dynamics of\r\nvortex filaments in three or more dimensions. The function space BnV turns\r\nout to provide a natural setting for this and related problems. BnV\r\nconsists of functions that, in a precise sense, have bounded\r\nn-dimensional variation. The principal investigator will investigate\r\nproperties of BnV functions with an eye towards applications to problems\r\nin partial differential equations and the calculus of variations.\r\n\r\nWe propose to study some questions that include the motion of vortex\r\nfilaments in certain kinds of superfluids, and related\r\nquestions in pure mathematical analysis.\r\nThe most familiar example of a vortex filament is a smoke ring.\r\nSuch rings start out small, and as they move, their diameters tend\r\nto expand. Simultaneously, they rotate more slowly as their vorticity\r\ndecreases.  If one could blow a smoke ring in (bosonic) liquid helium,\r\nit would exhibit quite different behavior.  In liquid helium,\r\nthe vorticity can only assume certain values. This in effect should\r\nprevent the vorticity along a smoke ring from decreasing, which in\r\nturn should prevent the ring from exanding. Thus a vortex filament in\r\nliquid helium is expected to propagate without its length increasing and\r\nwithout the rate of rotation changing. Some of the proposed work\r\ninvolves developing an understanding of this filament motion,\r\nstarting from basic equations that describe bosonic superfluids.\r\nThis is difficult, in part because the vortex filaments do not\r\nappear in the equations in any explicit way. Other aspects\r\nof the project involve studying a class of functions that can\r\nbe used to describe these vortex filaments and other related\r\nphenomena.\r\n",
