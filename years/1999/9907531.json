 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ethnic conflict that occurs in many contemporary multi-ethnic societies is often claimed to be associated with strong ethnic identification. However, studies that link ethnic identification to ethnic conflict tend to treat the former as a simple attribute, equally present for all members of an ethnic group. This approach is questionable, for it ignores social and individual variation and fails to address sufficiently the conditions under which ethnic identities are engendered. Consequently, we have only a superficial account of the link between identity and conflict. This doctoral dissertation research will address these deficiencies by examining the conditions under which ethnic identities become salient and the role two key social attributes, class and gender, play in this process. Relevant data for assessing these issues will be collected in a survey on ethnic identity in Mauritius, a strategic site for examining these phenomena. Results from the study should provide a better understanding of the conditions under which strong ethnic identification occurs and its potential for ethnic conflict.",
