 "awd_abstract_narration": "The archaeological site of Teotihuacan which is located in the Valley of Mexico a short distance from Mexico City was, at its apogee, one of the largest and most populous prehistoric metropolises in the New World. Construction at its sacred center was initiated during the first two centuries B.C. During the following state of monumental construction a series of large imposing stone pyramids were erected; the urban area around them covered approximately 20 square km, with about 60,000 to 80,000inhabitants by A.D. 150. The Teotihuacan state extended its influences throughout many parts of Mesoamerica and its power continued for centuries until its apparent sudden collapse in the seventh century. Although archaeologists most often focus their attention on large impressive structures associated with high ranking elites, at Teotihuacan just the opposite is the case. Extensive survey and excavation over decades has resulted in the exposure of many typical house compounds and a great deal is known about \"ordinary\" life at the site. With prior NSF support Dr. Sugiyama and his Mexican collaborators have conducted excavation through tunneling under the massive Mood Pyramid which lies at the center of the site. During one season of excavation they have discovered a series of buildings which represent smaller forms of the final massive structure. They have also discovered sacrificial burials associated with rich ritually significant grave offerings. During continued NSF supported work they hope to uncover royal burials and additional sacrificial remains and to analyze these materials. The Pyramids were designed to reflect the society's basic ideology and both the layout of the burials and the materials they contain will shed light on systems of belief, social organization and political control.\r\n\r\nArchaeologists wish to understand how complex societies arise and how, with simple technological systems, large numbers of people are organized into state systems. Mechanisms that establish and maintain hierarchies and which facilitate social control play a vial part in this process. This research will elucidate them at one of the most important sites in the New World.\r\n",
