Novel environmental conditions can lead to the expression of genetic variation which was present but not expressed in conventional environments. Novel environments can also lead to developmental instability.  The extent of environmental dependency of gene action and developmental stability is not known. The genome project plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, will be used as a model organism. Atmospheric CO2 levels will be manipulated to produce conventional and novel atmospheres, ranging from lowest pre-Pleistocene CO2 concentrations to the heretofore unexperienced  high CO2 concentrations expected in the next century. Using a combination of physiology, biochemistry, growth analysis and quantitative genetics, this experiment will determine: 1) the extent of shift in genetic variation expressed as a function of the extent of change in the environment, and 2) the metabolic and developmental mechanisms which drive the changes. \r\n\r\nGiven the current rate of human-induced environmental change, it is imperative that we understand the extent to which the biota on which we depend can adapt to those changes. This study will contribute to accuracy in the prediction of the biotic consequences of both local and global environmental perturbations. This model system will also contribute to an understanding of plant responses to changing atmospheric carbon dioxide, an important biological and economic question. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
