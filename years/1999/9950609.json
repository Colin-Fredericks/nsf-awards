 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field methods are an important part of engineering often ignored in the undergraduate curriculum.  The College of Engineering at Rowan University is incorporating field methods, both sampling and measurement, across its engineering curriculum.  Preplanned field exercises in laboratory components of select courses and modules are used in Freshman and Sophomore Engineering Clinics, and open ended field exercises are used as part of Junior and Senior Engineering Clinics.  These efforts extend current engineering clinics at Rowan by adapting and unifying the laboratory approaches at the Chemical Engineering Department at New Jersey Institute of Technology (traditional, specific laboratory experiments) and at the Chemical Engineering Department at Colorado State University (discipline specific engineering design projects).  The cross-disciplinary interactions are adapted from work going on at Clarkson University's Civil and Environmental Engineering Department.\r\n\r\nThis project is supporting the purchase of field equipment which is used to obtain water, air, and sediment samples, measure fundamental soil, water and atmospheric parameters in the field, and survey/map field sites.  In preplanned activities, students complete specific tasks similar to traditional laboratory exercises, except the activities are conducted outside using field equipment.  In open-ended activities, students determine what media they need to collect and what field measurements they need to make to solve open-ended problems.",
