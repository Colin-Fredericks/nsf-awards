 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971127\r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on two major areas in spatial statistics:  inference for point processes and prediction and inference for Gaussian random fields.  The work in point processes is largely motivated by questions arising in the analysis of an important cosmological catalog of locations along the lines-of-sight between quasars and the Earth of what are known as heavy-element absorbers.  This catalog provides a means for assessing the clustering of matter in the universe over very large spatial scales and for describing changes in this clustering as the universe has evolved.  The absorber catalog can be most simply modeled as a collection of realizations of a point process observed on a large number of intervals.  The fact that the process is observed over many regions rather than one large contiguous region produces some interesting opportunities and challenges for estimating properties of the point process and obtaining valid standard errors for the estimates.  For example, one can use resampling methods with the regions as sampling units to obtain confidence statements, although the problem is rather difficult if, as in the absorber catalog, the regions are of different sizes.  The proposed work on Gaussian random fields addresses several problems related to prediction when the covariance structure of the random field is partially unknown.  Under the natural asymptotic regime of an increasing number of observations in a fixed and bounded domain, only in some very simple cases is it presently possible to prove that predictions based on an estimated covariance structure are asymptotically optimal.  Recent work by Putter and Young provide a promising approach for proving such results.  This proposal also addresses the design of observation networks for prediction when the covariance structure is unknown.  For prediction, the local behavior of the random field is critical and practical experience has demonstrated that evenly spaced observations are poor designs when trying to infer this local behavior.  This proposal aims to provide theoretical support to this empirical finding.  For example, preliminary work shows that there is tremendous potential for improving the estimation of the fractal dimension of a Gaussian process by taking observations on two grids of very different spacing rather than on a single evenly spaced grid.\r\n\r\nSpatial statistics is a rapidly growing area of inquiry with broad applicability to the natural and social sciences.  Despite its present widespread usage, the theoretical properties of many commonly applied procedures in spatial statistics are poorly understood.  The first major topic of this proposal is the analysis of data made up of locations in space.  This work is motivated by a cosmological data set that provides important information about the large-scale structure of the universe.  Estimating this large-scale structure is a critical component in resolving the fundamental cosmological problem of how the universe evolved from its nearly uniform early state to its present highly clumped state.  In addition to the direct application the proposed work has to cosmology, the problems addressed also occur naturally in microscopy.  The second major topic in this proposal is the prediction of quantities such as temperature, pollution concentrations and soil characteristics whose levels vary randomly across space.  Two specific problems include studying the properties of such predictions when there is uncertainty about how the values of this quantity fluctuate in space and selecting the locations of observations to yield accurate predictions.  Spatial prediction is widely used in the atmospheric sciences, pollution monitoring, hydrology and mining.\r\n\r\n",
