 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971326\r\nSilvera\r\n\r\nThis project has three thrusts in high pressure diamond anvil cell (DAC) physics: NMR; extension of the ruby pressure scale and the physics of ruby. A promising new geometry for NMR in a DAC has already extended the pressure range for this technique by more than a factor of 2 to a few hundred kilobars.  The technique will be developed to extend to megabar pressures. Ortho-para conversion, important for the understanding of the properties of high pressure hydrogen will be studied directly by NMR to these high pressures. High pressure phases involve orientational ordering.  Phase lines can be observed by the collapse of the Pake doublet in hydrogen to a singlet in going from the ordered to disordered phase.  Theoretical calculations of metallization of hydrogen predict that the molecular bond shrinks then grows with increasing pressure.  The bond length can be studied from the splitting of the Pake doublet.  In a DAC the ruby fluorescence spectrum is the most important means of determining pressure.  Currently, the quasi-hydrostatic scale is only calibrated to 80 GPa; we shall extend this to the multi-megabar range at a synchrotron, doing simultaneous measurements of the ruby spectrum and the equation of state of known pressure markers under the same pressure.  We shall also study the solid phases of ruby as predicted phase changes have received little attention in this region and can also impact on the ruby pressure scale.\r\n%%%\r\nHigh pressure research extending into the megabar pressure range is a rapidly growing field of physics. In this program both graduate and undergraduate students are trained in methods of generating high pressure in Diamond Anvil Cells (DACs) on a table-top. Methods of nuclear magnetic resonance will be extended to megabar pressures, studying samples of hydrogen and its isotopes. Ruby will be studied in the megabar pressure range at a synchrotron radiation source to understand its structure, also producing an important new calibration of pressure in the megabar range.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
