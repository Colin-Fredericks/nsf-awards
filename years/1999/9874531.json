 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because plants are immobile, they adapt to their environment by alteration of their development and physiology.  Since plants are photosynthetic, light is a critical factor that influences nearly every aspect of plant development, including seed germination, plant structure, and the timing of flowering.  The genetic mechanisms that underlie plant developmental responses to the light are poorly defined.  We have isolated a set of arabidopsis mutants that have exaggerated developmental responses to red, far-red and blue light.  These mutants may be defective in elements of the light signal transduction pathway.  Genetic mapping will be used to define the location of two of these mutations in the arabidopsis genome, and this information will be used to clone and characterize the corresponding wild-type genes.  Detailed genetic, molecular and biochemical analysis will be carried out in order to identify the specific functions of the cloned genes, and to determine the roles they play in light signaling.  This work is significant in that it will provide insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms plants use to modulate their development in response to the environment.",
