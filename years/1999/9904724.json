 "awd_abstract_narration": "During development the fine processes of nerve cells, or neurons, make synaptic contacts to transmit and to receive signals with the proper cellular targets, a crucial need for constructing a functional nervous system.  A variety of anatomical studies have shown that the receiving structures, called dendrites, undergo extensive remodeling over time during normal development.  It is not clear how rapidly this remodeling can occur, or how it may be regulated by neural activity.  This project uses the isolated retina of the embryonic chick eye as a model system.  A newly developed technology allows high-resolution, real-time microscopic imaging of dye-filled individual cells to provide important new information about these morphogenetic events.  Pharmacological tools will be used to enhance or inhibit the effect of neurotransmitter compounds on the dendritic terminals.  Observations will be made on how rapidly dendrites change length and branching, and how the physiological activity of neurotransmitter release at synapses regulates dendritic remodeling.\r\n   Results will be important beyond simply neuronal development in the eye, because plastic change at nerve synapses also occurs throughout the brain, and  during learning.  The project also provides excellent postdoctoral training.\r\n",
