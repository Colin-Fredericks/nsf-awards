The initiative focuses on the planning needed for an LSC effort in mathematics at the K-8 levels.  The proposal indicates that all of Southeast Alaska is characterized by a diverse student population, with particular concern for Alaskan Native children who have not experienced the success which their parents and community would wish for them.  This planning grant proposal seeks to involve the teacher participants in planning for the consideration and implementation of standards-based mathematics instruction.  Major objectives of the project will include the development of a plan to use local/regional resources to raise the level of content and pedagogical knowledge of K-8 teachers, assess the impact of emerging technology on daily mathematics instruction, analyze the role of assessment and consider how to use such results to adjust instruction.",
