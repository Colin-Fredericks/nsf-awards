Urbana-Champaign \r\n\r\nResearch Summary: The overall thrust of the research is to endow surfaces a capability for interacting intelligently with their environment.  The proposed CAREER project focuses on fulfilling a pre-requisite to intelligent surfaces - enhancing the sensitivity of surfaces.  By using self-assembling surfaces, two main questions will be addressed:\r\n\r\nFirst, how can surfaces be formed that re-structure in response to selective wavelengths of light and show dramatic changes in interfacial properties such as wettability?  A hierarchical strategy will be explored based on magnifying properties of photo-isomerizable, small molecules that impact wetting (e.g., geometry and polarity) and organizing the molecules onto a solid substrate to further amplify the interfacial response.  Important questions to be answered are - can energetic barriers to assembly of polar molecules on a surface be overcome, and what molecular parameters impact the photo-stimulation efficiency?\r\n\r\nSecond, how can a surface's sensitivity to selective chemical species in its environment be controlled to permit only certain molecules to associate with the surface?  By focusing on molecular associations promoted primarily by the goodness-of-fit we will study the case where the host molecule is tethered at a surface so that it is neither completely mobile nor completely immobile.  A central objective will be to understand the role of structural organization and reorganization of the surface during association.  The influence of surface density of the hosts, steric barriers in accessing the host cavity, and molecular flexibility of the tethers of hosts to solid surfaces will be clarified.\r\n\r\nBesides identifying principles for engineering surfaces, optical control of interfacial properties such as wettability will permit transport of fluids at micrometer scales (e.g., in miniaturized laboratories on chips), auto-cleaning or defogging of surfaces, and modulating surface-adsorption of proteins.  Chemically selective surfaces will enable novel separations and detection of bio/chemicals.\r\n\r\nEducational Plan: The proposed educational plan aims to enhance the core competency of students at both undergraduate and graduate levels by building on the expertise of the PI.  Specifically, two new courses will be developed that focus on (a) Optical Methods in Chemical Engineering (for graduate students) and (b) Chemical Surface Physics (undergraduate students).  The former will equip graduate students for their research careers and train them in the theory and practice of methods involving scattering or polarization of light and evanescent optical fields.  Undergraduate students in chemical engineering will be introduced to hard (e.g., metals and dielectrics) and soft surfaces (e.g., polymers and molecular films), their properties and the methods to modify them.  This course will be a significant addition to the undergraduate curriculum because interfacial engineering constitutes an increasingly important aspect of products and processes that involve chemical engineers (for example, photolithography, protective coatings and thin films, lubrication, biocompatible surfaces).\r\n\r\nIn addition, scientific learning and inquiry will be fostered through directed instruction and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the proposed research program.  Finally, the undergraduate core curriculum will be improved by revision of two existing upper-level courses.  A course on mass transfer operations will integrate technologies that are reshaping chemical separations (e.g., membrane technology and reverse osmosis) and rely on molecular-level phenomena.  A capstone Process Design course will stress importance of non-technical components such as oral communication skills and financial analyses along with schooling in principles of safety and protection of environment to impart a strong yet comprehensive engineering education.\r\n\r\n",
