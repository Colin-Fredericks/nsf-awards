However, no information is available on the effect of higher loading rate on the size effect. Structural concrete can be subjected to high loading rates, such as those associated with dropped objects, vehicle collision into structures, accidental industrial explosions, etc. The size effe ' ct is a phenomenon explained by fracture mechanics, and it is related to the energy balance during the fracture process. Although the structural response and damage evolution are expected to be size-dependent, it is not clear how the time dimension affects this phenomenon. It is proposed to combined testing and numerical simulations aimed at enhancing the understanding of the size effect phenomenon by studying the possible effects of loading rate on it. The testing activities on compressively-loaded concrete cylinders will focus on collecting test data whose analysis could provide evidence on the effect of loading rate on the size effect for structural concrete in compression. Parallel computational simulations will be used to perform 'numerical tests' of the same structural/material samples, and to explore the role of the time dimension on the physical phenomena that contribute to the size effect on these structures. The proposed tests will be used to study the behavior of cylindrical concrete specimens under high rate compressive forces, corresponding to impact velocities of up to 10 m/s. These specimens will be related to standard 6\" X 12\" (diameter X height, both in inches) concrete cylinders used for determining the uniaxial compressive strength of concrete. The proposed dimensions for the test specimens are: 3\" X 6\", 611 X 12\", 1211 X 24\", and 24\" X 48\". The tests will be performed at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU), with supporting validation tests at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Canada, and at the National defense Academy (NDA), Japan, under a purchased services contract with these organizations. The tests at different test facilities with their drop hammer devices are planned to insure test data objectivity. The PI for this study will perform these tests, in cooperation with colleagues at the other research organizations. This approach will not only\r\n\r\nenable\ta wiaer range of-test data, but also mean ng u comparisons between\r\ndata obtained with different devices. Such a comparison could have very\r\nimportant implications in formulating a modified size effect law that\r\nincludes a consideration of time.\r\n",
