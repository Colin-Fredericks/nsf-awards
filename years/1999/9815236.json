This subfamily is commonly referred to as the \"sweat bees\" because of their attraction to human sweat.  Halictid bees comprise roughly 20% of the bee fauna in most regions of the world, and are most common in the northern Hemisphere.  In the US there are as many as 320 species and some are important pollinators of native plants.  Halictid bees provide an ideal system for studying social evolution because species range from solitary to highly social.  The highly social forms are similar to honey bees in sociality in that there are morphologically distinct queen and worker castes, most of the reproduction is carried out by the queen, and workers aid the queen in foraging and nest defense.  How such societies evolve is a major question in evolutionary biology and only a few groups of organisms provide insights into this process.  The project will use a combination of morphological and DNA sequence data to infer the historical relationships among genera and among species.  The phylogenetic trees will then be used to understand how the social behavior of these bees has evolved through time.  Phylogenetic analysis will also provide a method for inferring the pathway taken from solitary to highly social behavior, and can be used to identify cases in which social lineages have given rise to solitary descendants.\r\n",
