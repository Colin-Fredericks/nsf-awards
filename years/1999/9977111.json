Clark\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a nanofabrication aligner/bonder and hot embosser for the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility  (CNF) to support the needs of present and future users in the area of microfluidics.\r\n\r\nMicrofluidic systems are miniature devices or networks of devices, which can pump, mix, monitor or control very small quantities of liquids. As the integrated circuit revolutionized the electronics industry it is anticipated that integrated microfluidic systems can revolutionize the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, particularly in areas such as combinatorial chemistry, drug discovery, genomics, and proteomics. In particular, applications of  microfluidics devices span activities in chemistry, biology, biomedicine, biophysics, and micromechanics. Microfluidic fabrication itself is an exciting blend of MEMS, biology, chemistry and microelectronics.  \r\n\r\nThe most pressing need in microfluidics is to develop capabilities to fabricate a large variety of microchannel networks in a wide range of materials, especially optically transparent materials such as glass and polystyrene. The fabrication of \"biochips\" is one rapidly developing area of microfluidics application. Biochips automate highly repetitive laboratory tasks by replacing cumbersome equipment with miniaturized, microfluidic assay chemistries integrated onto a single platform. Biochip technologies are becoming increasingly important in drug discovery and development applications. Another area is the fabrication of increasingly complex synthetic gels for DNA analysis. The fabrication of neuron circuits with the appropriate ancillary cells to support viability is also a promising application of microfluidics. To meet the promise of microfluidics, many of these structures will have to be fabricated inexpensively and used essentially disposably. This is difficult with current fabrication techniques.\r\n\r\nMicrofluidic structures present several challenges to traditional microfabrication, including demands for new materials and the need for deep 3-dimensional structures and networks. Some of these can be addressed by extensions of common thin film technology. Several new fabrication technologies, however, are available which can have a significant impact on the area of microfluidics. The equipment supported by this grant will significantly enhance the capabilities of CNF and strengthen the CNF Users Program. \r\n",
