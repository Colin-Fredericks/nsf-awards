 "awd_abstract_narration": "By using a spectrofluorimeter, students are acquiring skills in fluorescence, phosphorescence and excitation techniques.  Twelve specific experiments are being adapted from either the research literature or from the Journal of Chemical Education.  In addition, eight new experimental procedures are being developed. The spectrofluorimeter is used in the physical chemistry laboratory to study quenching of excited states and to use selection rules to assign excited states. In the inorganic laboratory, the instrument is used to characterize compounds synthesized in the laboratory, to study the photophysical properties of important excited state complexes, to distinguish between fluorescence and phosphorescence, to follow the progress of a photochemical reaction, and to record a sharp-line excitation spectrum in order to determine ligand field properties. The quantitative determination of trace metal concentrations through the fluorescence of porphyrin complexes is conducted in our analytical course. Protein conformational analysis and concentration determination is investigated by using fluorescence techniques in our biochemistry course. Finally, environmental applications of fluorescence methods are being incorporated into a non-science majors course and general chemistry laboratory.  All materials developed are to be available on the internet and presented at chemical education conferences. In addition, several undergraduate research projects involving the spectrofluorimeter are underway. Research results are to be presented by undergraduates at local, regional and national conferences and published with undergraduate co-authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
