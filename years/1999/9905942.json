Organizers are Dr. Jonathan Glass, Louisiana State University, Shreveport and Dr. Marco T. Nunez, University of Chile.  The workshop will take place in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the Biology Society of Chile, and is designed to bring together scientists with an interest in molecular aspects of iron and copper transport and metabolism.  It has been noted that although copper and iron metabolism are intimately related, the scientists of both fields rarely communicate.  Therefore, a better understanding of iron-copper interaction would foster knowledge in iron and copper metabolism, and would establish future avenues of collaborative research.  \r\n\r\nBesides fomenting interactions between scientists, and strengthening international scientific collaboration, the workshop will enable US and Chilean scientists and students to become aware of the newer molecular developments in this area of research. The attendance of leading scientists in the field from both US, and outstanding Latin American laboratories is likely to lead to closer integration of research efforts In addition to the US and Latin American participants, the workshop will congregate a worldwide assembly of leading scientists in the field, including scientists from Europe, Israel and Japan. \r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
