Artin,\r\nwhich states that a non-negative polynomial in n real variables\r\ncan be written as a sum of squares of rational functions. The\r\nproposal seeds to determine exactly when a given nonnegative\r\npolynomial in n complex variables can be written as a quotient of\r\ntwo functions, each of which is the sum of squares of holomorphic\r\npolynomials.  A conjecture is stated, which as a special case\r\nwould likely lead to a constructive version of Artin's theorem.\r\nThe second problem is concerned with the Kuranishi problem, which\r\nseeks geometric conditions involving the Levi form that imply\r\nthat a given local neighborhood of a CR manifold can be embedded\r\ninto complex Euclidean space. The proposal describes a possible\r\napproach to the problem of finding such an embedding when the\r\nassociated CR structure is minimally smooth.  The third problem\r\nis concerned with finding sufficient conditions for either\r\ncompactness or hypoellipticity of the complex Neumann problem in\r\nthe case when the boundary of the domain is of infinite type.\r\n\r\nIt is well-known fact that not all results in mathematics can be\r\nimmediately applied to so-called real world problems. Sometimes\r\nthe proof of an important statement depends on abstract methods\r\nwhich cannot be easily applied in more concrete situations which\r\ncall for an explicit construction. For the first problem, the\r\nproposer is examining a well-known theorem in algebra which uses\r\nabstract methods to explain why certain polynomials are always\r\nnonnegative. In order for this theorem to be used in the real\r\nworld, it would be very important to find a constructive proof of\r\nthis theorem.  The second part of the proposal has to do with a\r\nproblem in geometry in which a a surface in effect is not smooth\r\nand has sharp corners or twists built into it.  Such problems are\r\nalso important for applications because in problems having to do\r\nwith the shapes of objects, it is rarely the case that the\r\nobjects are completely smooth.  Although the problem that is\r\nstudied is somewhat theoretical, it often happens that techniques\r\ndeveloped in one problem can often be used in related areas as\r\nwell.\r\n",
