The materials chosen are metallic glasses, multi-phase alloys containing a metallic glass matrix, metals with grain sizes between 30 nm and 3 microns, and amorphous polymers.  Each of these materials exhibits a tension-compression asymmetry in the flow strength and deforms by shear banding on planes, which are not predicted by classical continuum mechanics.  The understanding of these phenomena is incomplete, and there are large discrepancies in the literature concerning the sense of deviation of the shear band plane as well as whether the deviation and tension-compression asymmetry are due to hydrostatic pressure or normal stress effects.  Further, the sense of the deviation of the shear band plane, which provides insight into the deformation mechanisms, is inconsistently reported in the literature, even for the same material.  Performing mechanical tests on a single machine in a single laboratory should clarify these issues.  Shear bands are characterized by advanced techniques, including atomic force microscopy and atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy aided by focussed ion beam thinning techniques.  Studies of local chemistry changes in and around the shear bands are conducted with resolutions on the order of 1 nm.  Mechanics analyses promote understanding of shear band widths, angles, spacing and statistical distributions, as well as effects of stress state and shear band configuration on the overall constitutive behavior.  The grant is co-funded with the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Engineering CMS Mechanics and Materials Program.\r\n%%%\r\nBulk metallic glasses and bulk nanostructured metals are two classes of novel structural materials, which have attracted substantial interest.  Bulk metallic glasses have found commercial applications in sports equipment and the continued development of nanostructured metals and composites might lead to commercialization of these materials.  A common link between bulk metallic glasses and nanostructured metals is their mechanical behavior.  Both materials shear band as the first and only mechanism of plastic deformation and exhibit no strain hardening.  Similar behavior is observed for many amorphous polymers.  This shear banding is of fundamental interest and of critical technological importance to the further development of these materials since shear banding is responsible for limited tensile ductility and anomalously low fatigue performance.\r\n***\r\n",
