McLaughlin\r\n\r\nAbstract: The proposed research concerns applications of Riemann-Hilbert problems and new techniques developed for their asymptotic analysis to classical problems in (1) random matrix theory, (2) approximation theory and orthogonal polynomials, and (3) integrable systems. In random matrix theory, McLaughlin proposes to study eigenvalue statistics in situations when the limiting density of states exhibits \"atypical\" behavior in order to illustrate explicitly nonuniversal behavior in local statistics of random matrices. He further proposes to study coupled families of random matrices, which appear in the study of the planar appoximation to quantum field theory as well as in graph coloring problems that arise in statistical mechanics. Other directions include new asymptotic problems pertaining to the bulk scaling limit. In approximation theory, McLaughlin proposes to continue work on support properties of equilibrium measures, to gain further understanding of the relationship between the external field V and the support of the associated equilibrium measure. In addition, an investigation of pointwise convergence of polynomials orthogonal with respect to Freud weights is proposed. The proposed research is to study the generalization of Gibbs's phenomenon to Freud weights and to obtain a rate of convergence of approximation by such polynomials. In integrable systems, McLaughlin proposes (with A. Kuijlaars) to combine knowledge from approximation theory and singular limits of integrable systems, to investigate the onset of infinite genus oscillations in the small dispersion limit of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Another project (with S. Kamvissis and P. Miller) looks at a special class of initial data for the semi-classical limit of the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation.\r\n\r\nRandom matrix theory has recently been the meeting ground for many areas of mathematics and physics. One reason for the subject's importance is the famous claim of Eugene Wigner who, in the 1950s, proposed that \"neutron resonance levels\" could be modeled by the \"eigenvalues of a random matrix.\" Neutron resonance levels are special numerical values for the velocities of neutrons: when physicists fired neutrons at a large quantity of atoms with heavy nuclei, they observed that the neutrons were \"trapped\" by the bulk of atoms only for these special velocities. Wigner's conjecture asserts: the statistical distribution of the distance between these resonance levels is a universal quantity, just as the speed of light in a vacuum is, according to Einstein's theory of relativity, a universal constant. Over the years, Wigner's conjecture became a fundamental issue in mathematics as well as physics: Can this universal behavior be modeled by thinking of the resonance levels as \"typical\" eigenvalues of matrices chosen at random by some simple mathematical rules? For a large class of random matrix models, McLaughlin and his collaborators discovered a mathematically precise description of the statistics of eigenvalues of random matrices, thus providing a proof of Wigner's conjecture. A part of McLaughlin's current research is devoted to a deeper understanding of this fundamental universal behavior. In other directions, McLaughlin is working to develop further the techniques mentioned above, because of their application to many different areas of mathematical analysis and physics.
