 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project objective is to design and evaluate seven instructional modules (average speed, task completion, mixtures, distance-rate-time, biological dynamics, physical dynamics, review) to improve students' estimation, reasoning, and problem-solving skills in an intermediate algebra course. The modules provide an animation of the situation (filling a tank, completing a round trip) to provide visual feedback regarding the accuracy of students' estimates and calculations. Each module begins with estimation experiences which sharpen estimation skills and provide motivation for learning analytic techniques for calculating the answers.  Plot estimates and correct answers are provided so students can attempt to infer what kind of functional relations link the variables. Algebraic techniques are introduced for solving the problems, and the students are encouraged to apply these techniques to solve more challenging problems and to reason conceptually (such as explaining why a function approaches an asymptote).\r\n\r\nThe curriculum would be evaluated as part of the Minority Science Improvement Program at Southwestern Community College in Chula Vista, California. The student population is composed of 78% ethnic minorities including 52% Hispanic, 14% Filipino, 6% African American, 4% Pacific Islander, and 1 % Native American. The program is designed to improve the transfer rates of minority students who have an interest in mathematics, science, or engineering.",
