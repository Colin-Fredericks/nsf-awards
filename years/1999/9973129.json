The Brauer group of the function field F of a rational p-adic curve can be fruitfully studied by examining its restriction to the completion F_p at the arithmetic prime p.  PI has in this way proved the existence of F-noncrossed products using lifting techniques tailored to this situation, and in part I of this project plans to determine more fine structure over F such as the theory of decomposability, index reduction, and noncrossed products.  In part II, PI plans to study the influence of ramification on the Brauer group over a general field by examining its effects on index, splitting, and decomposability, in the special setting of rank two henselian fields over fields of cohomological dimension two, such as number fields and generalized local fields.  One example of such a field is the generalized local field of dimension four.  The combination of a limited measure of totally ramified division algebras and a nontrivial index theory (index not equal to exponent) first occurs in these settings, and an analysis appears to be both interesting and tractible.\r\n\r\nA division algebra is number system that has multiplication/division, like the complex numbers C, only these operations are noncommutative. W. R. Hamilton discovered the first example, the ``real quaternions'', in 1843 while searching for a way to define multiplication/division on real 3-space extending the one possessed by 2-space (given by C).  His discovery, which he considered to be the greatest of his career, showed that it could be done (only) in real 4-space.  Since Hamilton, division algebras extending many interesting number systems (fields) other than the real numbers have been found, and it has been realized that apart from being an interesting and beautiful subject in its own right, the theory of the division algebras extending a given field provides important information about the field itself.  This project seeks to understand the ``pathologies'' (obstructions to a general theory) that occur in division algebras by examining them in their most elemental forms.  Part one investigates fine structure over the function field of a curve defined over the p-adic field.  This field is of interest as perhaps the most elemental function field with a theory that includes standard pathologies such as noncrossed products and unequal index and exponent.  Part two investigates division algebras with a strictly controlled pathology known as total ramification, a notorious obstruction to general theory.  The PI has partial results to support the tractibility of these projects, in addition to examples illustrating their general interest.\r\n",
