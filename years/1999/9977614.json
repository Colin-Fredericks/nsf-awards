A versatile system that satisfies all of the experimental requirements has been identified. It consists of key components from three different vendors:  (1) an 18 kW rotating anode X-ray generator (Rigaku UltraX 18SFHB), (2) a four-circle goniometer (Huber 430-440-512.1) , (3) graphite and Ge monochromators and He-filled beam path, detectors, optical table, radiation shield enclosure, electronics and control and analysis software (Blake Industries), (4) a low temperature (6.5- 350K) cryostat and compressor (APD cryogenics CSW-202G,), and (5) a high temperature reaction Chamber (RT - 900 C) (Enraf-Nonius). The instrument will be used to perform in-situ and ex-situ x-ray diffraction experiments, in conjunction with electrical and magnetic property measurements to study the crystal structure, three-dimensional strain states, defects, phase transition, morphology, and their roles in materials properties.  It will also be used to monitor solid-solid and solid-gas reactions in-situ to determine the conditions and mechanisms by which the reactions take place.  This will facilitate synthesis and fabrication of novel solid state materials and investigation of their structures and electrical and magnetic properties.  This instrument will enhance the research capabilities of five members from three departments at Duke University and the University of North Carolina (UNC), as well as significantly enhancing the educational mission of the Materials Science Programs at Duke and UNC.  The variable temperature four-circle x-ray diffraction system is an ideal instrument for a laboratory component of  courses in X-ray diffraction and analysis and will be used for training students at Duke and UNC in state-of-art materials characterizations.   It will also provide an outreach mission to other research institutes and industries in the North Carolina Research Triangle Area. \r\n\r\nNanostructured and thin film novel materials are of national interest because of their applicability to a wide variety of electronic, magnetic and optical devices.  Structural analysis of materials on an atomic scale is very important for understanding material properties.  Furthermore, it greatly facilitates the synthesis of new materials and the study of fundamental physical phenomena.  The variable temperature four-circle x-ray diffraction system that will be acquired using Major Research Instrumentation program funds will enhance the research capabilities of researchers in the North Carolina Research Triangle Area, as well as provide a vehicle for training students in state-of-the-art materials characterization techniques. \r\n\r\n",
