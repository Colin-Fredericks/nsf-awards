The meeting will be devoted to fundamental research topics related to chromosome duplication, structure, and function.  The need for this meeting is evidenced by the rapid advances made in this field over recent years.  The 1999 meeting will include talks  on  (1) the replication of viral chromosomes, including those of SV40, polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, papillomaviruses, and Epstein-Barr virus; (2) chromosomal replication and gene amplification in organisms as diverse as yeast, Drosophila,and Xenopus and in  mammalian cells; (3) control of DNA replication; (4) structure and function of chromosomal elements; and (5) control of cell cycle progression and S phase specific gene expression; (6) DNA replication and DNA repair;  and (7) telomeres. \r\n\r\nThe replication of an organism's genetic material is an essential feature of all life.  This meeting will bring together an international group of researchers working to deepen our understanding of this highly complex process.  It will ensure that recent results will be communicated and discussed in an atmosphere of face-to-face contact, an atmosphere which fosters the intellectual synergy necessary for rapid progress.  Participants will include established and emerging leaders in the field along with those just entering.  This award will be used to help defray the costs of less-established investigators participating in the conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
