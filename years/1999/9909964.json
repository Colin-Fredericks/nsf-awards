 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dense, non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) represent a significant threat to the quality of many groundwater aquifers in the United States.  Being denser than water, DNAPLs tend to sink to the base of an aquifer, spreading laterally and becoming trapped by low permeability strata.  Using traditional vertical wells to remediate DNAPL contaminated sites have proven inefficient owing to the limited contact area between the well and the contamination plumes.  Horizontal wells are thought to be efficient and cost-effective in such situations owing to the large interactive areas with the DNAPL plumes.  However, the present knowledge has not provided solutions of water-DNAPL two-liquids flows to a horizontal well.  This fact substantially prohibits the wise use of this technology for environmental practices.  This project is a combined theoretical and experimental study of DNAPL recovery using horizontal wells.  It will provide answers to problems such as the water-DNAPL interface change, and subcritical, critical and supercritical flows occurring in water-DNAPL two-liquid systems.  The relationship between water-DNAPL recovery ratio and parameters such as well location, pumping rate, density and viscosity differences, and permeabilities will be determined.  This research will provide a solid foundation for the improved application of horizontal well technology in DNAPL recovery. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
