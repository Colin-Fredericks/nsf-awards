 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to investigate all aspects of optimization problems over symmetric cones and extensions from algorithmic, numerical and software development points of view. Such optimization problems include and are closely related to semidefinite programming (SDP) and quadratically constrained \r\nquadratic programming (QCQP). In the first part, general techniques for both degeneracy properties and their impact on numerical behavior of various algorithms will be studied thoroughly. Particular attention will be given to the problem of dealing with absences of strict complementarity which thus far has eluded satisfactory numerical behavior in all known algorithms. Next, the process of extending special proof techniques and tools which were originally developed for analysis of the semidefinite and convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs, to the more general venue of symmetric cone optimization will be carried out. The techniques developed by interior point researchers will be extended to all symmetric cone optimization problems. A potential impact of this aspect of the research will be unification of various efforts in \r\ninterior point studies, especially the primal-dual methods, to the more general area of symmetric cone optimization which includes linear, semidefinite, and quadratically constrained quadratic programming as special case.\r\n \r\nNext, the central problem of using the optimal solution of an SDP (or a QCQP) to \"warm start\" another SDP (or QCQP) that differs from the original by one or few new constraints or variables will be investigated . This effort is central in order to make SDP or QCQP serious tools for solving large integer or mixed integer programs via branch and bound, cutting planes or similar techniques. A particular goal is to invent new dual based active set methods to carry out this goal. The project will start with perhaps the easier problem of investigating QCQP both in its own right and in order to gain insight in the \r\neffort to tackle SDP and ultimately general symmetric cone optimization problems. Also there is a puzzling gap in using QCQP problems as relaxation of integer programs. While LP and SDP relaxation abound, the QCQP approach has been use only on limited problems such as plant location and Steiner trees. A general scheme to relax any (zero-one) integer program to QCQP is missing. A goal of this effort is to design such a general relaxation. The impact is potentially significant. While SDP at least in principle seems to be more powerful than LP to as a relaxation of integer programs, the difficulty of solving large scale problems, especially lack of satisfactory techniques to solve sparse problems, has so far limited its wide scale use. The limitations on QCQP are much less severe and a general relaxation scheme to these problems could have significant \r\nimpact on at least some integer programming problems.\r\n\r\nNext new relaxation of integer program to more general convex programs than the traditional linear programming or SDP will be studied. A particular scheme based on using norms more general than the Euclidean norm will potentially yield new class of cones to which one can extend SDP relaxation. This work will be \r\ntheoretical and fundamental at the outset.\r\n\r\nNumerical study and in particular use of sparse structure encompasses another aspect of the project. In particular unlike semidefinite programming and somewhat like linear programming there is an significant opportunity in taking advantage of sparsity in order to solve large scale QCQP problems with primal-dual interior point methods. The details are different than linear programming and present considerable challenge in designing numerically stable and efficient algorithms. \r\n\r\nSoftware development will also be a central part of the investigation. Especially due to the vast variety of formats that SDP and QCQP, and in general symmetric cone optimization problems arise in applications, a user friendly interface will be essential if the software will be of wide applicability. \r\nTherefore, in addition to implementing and fine tuning the \"solver engine\", an elaborate shell around the engine is planned. This interface ill be designed to accommodate various problems form eigenvalue optimization to sum of norms constraints. As much as possible format conversions will be automated.  Interface to popular public modeling languages such as AMPL is planned. In addition WEB based interaction between users and software (such as web based submission of data, or cross platform interaction between user's data and the software) is planned. In particular some preprocessing of the data may be \r\ndone on the client side, before the data is submitted over the WEB to the server for solution.\r\n\r\n",
