 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of the stringent policies of apartheid, South African cities were among the most racially segregated cities in the world.  With the end of apartheid and the dramatic social, economic, and political reorganization of South Africa have come comparable changes of the nation's urban areas.  The growing demand for housing coupled with chronic shortages in the housing stock have exacerbated urban change.  Differences in the quality and quantity of housing coupled with various governmental policies and programs designed to alleviate the housing crisis have begun to alter the social geography of South African cities, but it is not clear whether these changes and policies are challenging the legacy of apartheid or reinforcing the apartheid landscapes of segregation.  This doctoral dissertation research project will focus on a case study of the rental housing market in Cape Town in two phases.  The first phase will focus on the collection of empirical data about the changing geography of the rental housing market.  The second phase will use three kinds of surveys to gather quantitative data and qualitative information from rental households, local residents, and local officials.  Structured interviews with 600 rental households drawn from a stratified clustered random sample will provide data about changing social and spatial patterns of rental housing as well as changing perceptions and key issues of concern among rental households.  In-depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted with at least 60 rental households to qualitatively explore changing social realities and mental landscapes of tenants.  Finally, individual and group open-ended interviews will be conducted with non-governmental as well as other local organizations involved in issues related to housing provision and policy.  This project will advance understandings of the changing character of housing markets in contemporary South African cities, and it will have practical utility for those engaged in policy making for rental housing in that nation.  The significance of this research extends beyond South Africa's borders, however, because this project will examine the difficulties in transforming urban systems that have been stratified territorially based on ethnicity and race.  As such, it will offer insights into the interplay between formal government policies, socioeconomic dynamics, and cultural factors that affect the ways that different groups of people relate to each other as they reorganize the spaces they occupy and use in urban settings.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.",
