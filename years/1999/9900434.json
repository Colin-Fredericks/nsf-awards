The specific aims of this project are: (I) Study the mechanisms of energy transfer and excitation fusion in conjugated dendrimer supermolecules, as a function of the antenna design, via femtosecond resolved spectroscopy. Also, design and test specialized dendrimer supermolecules, towards potential applications to optochemical nanosensors, resulting in nano-biosensors for cellular applications. (2) Study experimentally the so-called \"holy grail\" of non-classical kinetics, i.e., reactant self-segregation in an elementary bimolecular reaction, as well as the effects of long-term memory and convective momentum on elementary reaction kinetics and reactant pattern formation in confined domains. Regarding educational goals, the interdisciplinary teams we collaborate with range from physical to organic chemistry, from analytical chemistry to biophysics, from applied physics to neurotoxicology, and from electrical engineering to medical imaging. Combined with a concomittant wide range of facilities, this guarantees broad-based materials science training for the participating undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students.\r\n%%%\r\nThe study of dynamics in nano-domains is a multi-faceted enterprise, spanning many fields. This proposal covers issues of high priority to industry that will very likely influence US global competitiveness. This project unifies theoretical and experimental approaches and integrates education and research giving a particularly strong advantage to students being trained in important areas with potential applications ranging from chemical and biological nanosensors to catalysis and nitric oxide monitors.\r\n",
