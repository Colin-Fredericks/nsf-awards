 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the examination of the synthetic utility of chiral allenylmetallic reagents of tin, boron, titanium, chromium and palladium. Particular attention will be focused on SE' additions to aldehydes as a route to enantioenriched propargylic and allenic carbinols.  Among the issues to be addressed are:  The conformational and regiochemical stability of chiral allenyl and propargyl organometallics, the stereochemistry and regiochemistry of SE' additions involving these reagents, the effect of ligands on the enantioselectivity and regioselectivity of SE' additions with these reagents and the possible applications of these reagents in natural products synthesis.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of  Dr. James A. Marshall of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Virginia.  Professor Marshall will focus his work on the development of new synthetic methodology for the preparation of chiral carbon compounds by the use of chiral allenyl reagents of tin, boron, titanium, chromium and palladium.  These novel intermediates have potential for use in the construction of natural products of interest to the pharmaceutical and agricultural  industries.",
