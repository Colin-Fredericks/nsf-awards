The primary contact at CMU is the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at CMU, which has been supported by the National Science Foundation since 1996.  The award has three objectives:  (1) To strengthen the quality of the materials science and engineering (MSE) curriculum at FAMU; (2) to provide more opportunities for minority students, who are traditionally underrepresented in MSE, to participate in materials science research at FAMU and CMU; and (3) to enhance the materials resources at both FAMU and CMU through shared equipment and software.  The focus of the activities is the involvement of undergraduate students in research.  \r\n%%%\r\nThe award is to enhance the research and educational collaboration in the area of materials science and engineering between Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
