The basic format for the colloquium is established as centered around five theme sessions:  industry academic relations; informaiton and other technologies; relation between the natural and built evniroment; promotion of innovation; and education for the 21st century.  The workshop will be held March 19-21, 2000 at MIT.  the award is for partial fanancial support for the colloquium which will make it possible to enhance the conduct of the event, and to ensure the widest possilbe dissemination of the colloquium's proceedings in both priint and video media",
