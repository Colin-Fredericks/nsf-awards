 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will research, write, publish, and distribute a book of in-depth profiles on 30 high-achieving undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities who are pursuing coursework in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET). The students to be profiled will be selected from those who participated in the \"ENTRY POINT!\" program of summer internships in 1996, 1997, and 1998.  (ENTRY POINT!  is a collaborative effort of AAAS, private industry and federal agencies.)  Historically, students with disabilities have been discouraged from pursuing education and careers in SMET fields.  Too often, it is assumed that a student who has a significant disability would not consider aspiring to a scientific career.  Judging from the students whom AAAS identified, recruited, screened, and placed in the internships, this is not the case.  These students met high criteria such as demonstrated high motivation, persistence, and academic achievement.  The focus of the study and resulting publication will be the critical factors that directed and kept these students in the SMET pipeline (e.g., mentors at every level, role models with and without disabilities, precollege and postsecondary faculty, moral and financial support from families, counseling, legislation, assistive technology, and funding sources) and their views on barriers and solutions.  The resulting publication, Roadmaps and Roadways, will be widely distributed to leaders in education and employment fields.",
