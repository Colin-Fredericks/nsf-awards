By modeling information as an uncertainty reducing series of instructions, a decision maker creates a call on a particular result.  Financial options theory might then be used to value the information instrument.  The significance is that numerous management decisions might benefit from having better information value tools.\r\n\r\nThe second study provides an empirical complement by gathering data on management practices that contribute to productivity.  Software monitors will track organizational information flows.  Interviews will provide context.  Hypotheses - such as the value of decentralized access, focused communications, and incentives to promote sharing - will be tested using econometrics.  Study benefits include better understanding of information productivity, use of person rather than firm level data, and newly developed integration metrics.\r\n\r\nRelated educational activities include mentoring Ph.D. research assistants, teaching these topics in a new Information, Economics, Management, and Policy track, and codeveloping dual degrees in Public Policy, Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, and Law.",
