In the future, electronic brokerages must ideally provide time-cognizant, pro-active and innovative services based on complex user preferences similar to those expressed in verbal communication.  This research focuses on developing the theoretical foundations and a methodology to (a) develop user interface to specify complex preferences interactively, (b) translate preferences into appropriate processing specifications, (c) develop efficient algorithms to detect, update and cancel events in a timely manner, and (d) design mechanisms that efficiently bind actions to event/condition detection.  A software architecture will be developed to create component-based functional packages that can be plugged into commercial databases.  In addition, this research proposes an innovative approach to integrate economic principles into brokerage design tp provide the optimal service quality and to integrate the role of user trust.  The findings, validated by Java-based proff-of-concept software prototypes, will help create arobust and reliable brokerages for advanced electronic commerce applications.  the Integrated Educational Plan of this CAREER proposal includes the development of information technology and domain-related courses.  These courses will deal with the  design of domain-specific electronic brokerages and experimentation with new business models in the electronic environment.",
