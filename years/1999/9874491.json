 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kleene\r\n\r\nMeiotic and haploid spermatogenic cells in mammals provide an extraordinary example of translational regulation, which is characterized by a widespread block to translation initiation of virtually all mRNAs, and mRNA-specific changes in the rate of translation during development. Little is known about the cis-acting sequences that regulate the timing of mRNA translation in vivo. This research focuses on the mechanisms that regulate translation of the mRNA encoding the sperm mitochondria-associated cysteine-rich protein (SMCP), a cysteine- and proline-rich protein in the keratinous outer mitochondrial membranes of spermatozoa. The Smcp mRNA is one of a very small number of mRNAs that have been rigorously demonstrated to undergo developmental changes in translation rate. The expression of fusions between the 5' and 3' non-translated regions of the Smcp mRNA and the green fluorescent protein reporter gene will be studied in transgenic mice to determine whether the cis-acting sequences that regulate the timing of Smcp mRNA translation are located in the 5' and/or 3' non-translated regions. Another series of experiments will utilize RNA mobility shift assays to identify proteins that bind to specific sequences in the 3' and 5' non-translated region of the Smcp mRNA. A third objective will use non-isotopic in situ hybridization to resolve a controversy concerning whether two mRNAs that are translationally repressed in early haploid cells, the transition protein 1 and Smcp mRNAs, are strongly localized in the cytoplasm. \r\n\r\nThe sequence of bases in messenger RNAs is decoded into amino acid sequence in proteins by a process known as translation. The vast majority of messenger RNAs in mammalian cells are translated efficiently to make proteins. In contrast, developing sperm cells in the testes of mammals are unusual, because a large but variable portion of virtually all messenger RNA species is inactive in directing protein synthesis. The mechanisms that control the efficiency of translation of specific messenger RNAs in developing sperm cells are poorly understood. The goal of this research is to investigate the hypothesis that proteins that bind to specific sequences of bases in messenger RNAs prevent their translation in developing sperm cells. This research is also relevant to understanding the mechanisms that regulate the synthesis of proteins during embryonic development and the rapid responses of cells to their environment. \r\n",
