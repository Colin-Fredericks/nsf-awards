 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sen\r\n\r\nJuvenile hormone is the common name given to one or more structurally related compounds that are produced by insects and are essential for regulating insect growth and development.  The primary objective of this proposal is to better understand how moths make homologous juvenile hormone and in so doing, gain insight for how insect metabolism differs from other animals.  Moths are unique with regards to juvenile hormone metabolism- in this insect, the hormone is a heterogeneous mixture of compounds that differ structurally from one another by the presence of one to three extra carbons.  Moth juvenile hormone levels appear to be highly regulated, although the functional role of each of the homologues is not understood.\r\n\r\nThe specific aim of the research is to isolate and characterize the enzyme, prenyltransferase, which catalyzes the condensation of isoprene units (or in the case of moths, homologous isoprene units) and is a required event in juvenile hormone production.  Prenyltransferase will first be isolated from the endocrine gland that synthesizes the hormone, using both conventional protein purification methods and recombinant DNA technology.  These initial experiments will focus on ascertaining how many and what kind of prenyltransferase is present in moths and which of these are responsible for juvenile hormone production.  Subsequently, we will analyze the structural differences between juvenile hormone producing and other prenyltransferases, by evaluating their variability in amino acid sequence, catalytic properties, 3D-structure (to be determined computationally), and expression profiles.  For the latter, we will specifically examine whether juvenile hormone producing prenyltransferase is developmentally regulated and whether its levels (both transcriptional and translational) parallel those of hormone production, indicating the role of prenyltransferase in regulating juvenile hormone production (and structure) in moths.\r\n   \r\n\r\n",
