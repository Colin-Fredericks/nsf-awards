These goals are accomplished by (1) curricular reform in calculus, chemistry, and physics; (2) broadening interdisciplinary programs; (3) faculty development in successful models of student learning and in effective use of technology in teaching; (4) structured undergraduate research training; (5) undergraduate research experiences with universities, industry, national laboratories; (6) scholarships; (7) summer institutes to help students transition from high school to college and to build academic foundations for success in first and second-year courses; and (8) competitive recruitment. Outstanding qualities of TALENT-21 include a unified approach among faculty in physics, chemistry, and mathematics to improve learning in the SMET \"gate keeper\" courses, and early involvement of students in research through structured training experiences.\r\n\r\n",
