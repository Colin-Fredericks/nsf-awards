 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important aspects of space weather research is an understanding of the outflow of particle energy from the Sun and its effect on the terrestrial environment.  One approach to improving the understanding of the terrestrial effects is to develop models of particle input which can provide spectral or total energy inputs as a function of position as well as global or hemispheric energy input.  This research proposes to achieve such a model by building on a climatological model currently being developed using data from the UARS Particle Environment Monitor (PEM).  The principal limitation of the PEM data set and climatology is the lack of high-latitude coverage that results from the 57-degree inclination of the UARS orbit.  Accordingly, this proposal seeks to augment the current UARS climatology with additional low-altitude data.  The primary data set will be TIROS/NOAA spectral particle data since it contains spectral measurements up to the MeV range.  Data from the ISIS 1 and 2 polar orbiters, which made spectral measurements from the keV to MeV range, will also be added to extend the coverage through the ~1970 solar maximum and declining phase of Solar Cycle 20 and a portion of the ascending phase of Cycle 21.  The new, extended climatology will be an empirical statistical model built using a combined low Earth orbit database from which the user may obtain average spectral characteristics, precipitating particle fluxes, and ionization rate profiles as functions of latitude, local time, and activity level.  A unique aspect of this model will be the inclusion of differential measurements of high energy fluxes that extend to the ~MeV range.  The model may be made operational by using solar wind measurements at the L1 point.",
