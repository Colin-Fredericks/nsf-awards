 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies geometric structures on moduli spaces.  The recent\r\ntheorem of the investigators and Allcock that the moduli space of stable\r\ncubic surfaces is complex hyperbolic suggests that complex hyperbolic\r\nstructures on moduli spaces  are more common than previously expected.   The\r\nproject will develop the complex hyperbolic geometry of the moduli spaces of\r\nstable del Pezzo surfaces and of  stable cubic threefolds.  The consequences\r\nof this geometry to the topology of these spaces will be studied.  It is\r\nexpected that the moduli spaces of smooth del Pezzo surfaces and smooth cubic\r\nthreefolds are Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, and that their fundamental groups\r\nare not linear groups, perhaps not even residually finite groups.  The real\r\nhyperbolic geometry of the real points of these spaces, and the relation to\r\nthe real algebraic geometry of del Pezzo surfaces and cubic threefolds, will\r\nalso be developed.   Connections with symplectic geometry and automorphic\r\nforms are also expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general area of research concerns the study of spaces known as moduli\r\nspaces.  The central  idea is that a collection of geometric objects has\r\nitself its own geometry.  This new geometry is called the moduli space of the\r\noriginal objects.  There is a rich interplay between the geometry of the\r\noriginal objects and the geometry of the moduli space, for example the\r\nsymmetries of one reflect themselves in the symmetries of the other.  The\r\nsimplest example would be the shapes of triangles in the plane: each shape is\r\ndetermined by the ratios of the sides, the moduli space is the collection of\r\nthese ratios, a triangle in the plane with its own geometry.  This simple\r\nexample leads quickly to very intricate ones:  one could take more\r\ncomplicated polygons or polyhedra.  Or one could reduce the study of shapes\r\nof lattices in the plane (thus flat tori, thus elliptic curves, thus cubic\r\ncurves over the complex numbers) to this example.  Algebraic geometry gives\r\nmany interesting examples of moduli spaces whose geometry is very actively\r\nstudied.\r\n",
