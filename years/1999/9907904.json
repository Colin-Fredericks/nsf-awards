 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference on 'Geographic Information and Society' will be the first in a series of international conferences targeted broadly at researchers in academic disciplines engaging GIS-related activities, as well as practitioners in community organizations, government, and industry.  The motivation for such a conference series derives from an evolving recognition, spurred by academic debates over the past decade, that there are societal and theoretical implications of how people, space, and environment are represented within a geographical information system (GIS).  Specifically, GISs tend to embed a powerful, yet limited, conceptualization of Cartesian space (i.e., an inert, three-dimensional spatial reference framework) deep into the practices that surround their applications.  This perspective does not easily allow the realistic representation of such contextually rich and societally mediated concepts such as poverty, place, race, or neighborhood.  In this way, complex constructs are simplified and reduced to rigid, geometric categorizations (points, lines, and bounded areas) simply to accommodate the limitations of the technology.  The inherent danger is that geographic and social meanings may be misconstrued or misrepresented, and yet, these communicated meanings form the foundation for urban and environmental planning and for political and social practices.  These specific concerns regarding GIS follow on earlier ideas presented at specialist workshops conducted under the auspices of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis, and they are part of a larger engagement of the implications of information technologies for future societies in general.  \r\n\r\nThe conference will facilitate the exchange of ideas and catalyze further research on topics such as the ethical and legal aspects of GIS, uses and value of geographic information, grassroots organizations and access to information technologies, geographic representation of societal phenomena, and the ethics of geographically targeted marketing practices.  The award will be directed exclusively to facilitating the involvement of graduate students in the conference and will not be used to underwrite other portions of the conference.\r\n\r\n",
