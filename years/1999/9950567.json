 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a robust, portable, easy-to-use software application from the pilot version of WeBWorK currently in use, and will make this freely available to other educational institutions. It will also develop and distribute a database of WeBWorK calculus and pre-calculus problems.\r\n\r\nWeBWorK is an internet-based system for generating and delivering homework problems to students. WeBWorK enhances the educational effectiveness of homework in mathematics, physics, and other science and engineering disciplines by providing students with immediate feedback on the validity of their answers and giving them the opportunity to correct mistakes while they are still thinking about the problem. WeBWorK also provides students with individualized versions of problems which means instructors can encourage students to work together; yet each student must develop an answer to his or her own version of the problem.\r\n\r\nUsing WeBWorK, instructors can ask most questions found in calculus and other texts. WeBWorK can handle questions, which require numeric or symbolic answers in addition to standard true false, matching or short answer questions. Since WeBWorK is an Internet based program, instructors can use any Internet tools, such as JavaScript or Java applets, to enhance the educational effectiveness of the problems. The project will provide a central location for those who wish to distribute their own WeBWorK problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
