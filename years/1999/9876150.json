 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a program of research to explore the relationship\r\nbetween the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes held by middle school science\r\nteachers with respect to inquiry-based science with embedded learning\r\ntechnologies and their classroom practices with those technologies.  At its\r\nheart, this research is about the study of teacher change.  The teachers\r\nwho will participate in this work are part of a large-scale systemic change\r\ninitiative in the Detroit Public Schools, conducted jointly by the\r\nNSF-sponsored Detroit Urban Systemic Initiative (DUSI) and the Center for\r\nLearning Technologies in Urban Schools (LeTUS).  In that context, the\r\nteachers are all learning how to teach with new curriculum materials and\r\ntechnology, and they receive a broad range of professional development to\r\nsupport them in this learning.\r\n\r\nTo become successful with inquiry-based and technology-enhanced curricula,\r\nteachers will need to learn new science content (content knowledge); they\r\nwill need to learn new methods for organizing their classroom (pedagogical\r\nknowledge); and they will need to learn new techniques for teaching\r\nparticular kinds of content, such as the use of modeling tools to help\r\nstudents construct an understanding of how burning coal from factories\r\ncombines with air to create acid rain that impacts the environment\r\n(pedagogical content knowledge).  Teachers' attitudes toward technology\r\nneed to change, and their beliefs in their own self-efficacy with\r\ntechnology and new science material needs to improve.  DUSI and LeTUS\r\nattempt to help teachers change along these dimensions through activities\r\nthat include cognitive (providing evidence for the feasibility and benefits\r\nof using new approaches), social (learning and sharing with colleagues),\r\nand contextual (providing evidence for the support of the system)\r\nmechanisms for change.  There is little understanding at the present time\r\nas to how these aspects of change work either separately or together to\r\nfoster the use of technology in science teaching.\r\n\r\nThe main questions that this research asks are:\r\n\r\n1) What are teachers' knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes with respect to\r\nteaching science with technology, and how do they change over time?\r\n\r\n2) What are teachers' classroom practices with respect to technology, and\r\nhow do they change over time?\r\n\r\n3) What is the relationship between teachers' knowledge, beliefs, and\r\nattitudes and their classroom teaching practices with technology, and how\r\ndoes this change over time?\r\n\r\n4) How do professional development activities influence changes in\r\nteachers' knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and practice over time, and how\r\nmight those activities be re-designed to foster desired changes?\r\n\r\nThis research is designed to complement a program of instruction in the\r\nEducational Technology program at the University of Michigan.  Students in\r\nthis program will approach the study of technology in K-12 settings from\r\nthe perspective of teachers' technology use and cognition.  The research\r\nalso serves and as a setting for graduate students to conduct their own\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nThere are immediate practical benefits of this work for teachers in\r\nDetroit, where the results of the research will be used to re-shape\r\nprofessional development activities to more directly address their needs in\r\nreform.\r\n",
