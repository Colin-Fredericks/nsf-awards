This morphological, spatial, and temporal complexity is well suited to the tools of 3-D animation, which permit a models change in position through time to be freely manipulated. However, reconstructing limb function in extinct Mesozoic theropods has been problematic, because little direct evidence of limb excursion is available. This project will investigate a unique series of Late Triassic trackways, which were made by theropods sinking to variable depth. Soft substrates intercepted foot movements that would normally occur in air, thereby preserving 3-D records of theropod locomotor behavior. Three computer techniques will be used. (1) Visualization of the 3-D pathway of the toes using high resolution X-ray CT scanning. (2) Reconstruction of foot movement using 3-D animated track simulation. (3) Modeling of whole limb movements using reconstructed foot movements. This novel approach will allow the foot path and limb movements of 210 million year old theropods to be reconstructed for the first time. These conclusions, derived from footprints rather than skeletons, will provide independent evidence to test hypotheses of theropod functional evolution. The computer-based methodology will offer an example of how graphics and animation can contribute to the quantification, analysis, and communication of complex paleontological material.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
