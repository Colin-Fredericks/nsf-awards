 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GEMS project will open up careers in science, math and engineering to capable girls who face the difficulties of inner-city life.   As a result of differences in the way girls, particularly girls of color, are treated at home and in school; their preferred expressive way of working; and the lack of role models in their lives, the following objectives have been set:\r\n          1.  Increase the self-confidence of the girls in our intervention.\r\n          2.  Build on girls' belief that science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) is a good thing and have \t                 them come to believe it is also relevant to their lives.\r\n          3.  Increase positive attitudes toward SEM, where they are flagging.\r\n          4.  Create the belief that a SEM-related identify is compatible with their identities as women.\r\n          5.  Allow girls' cognitive style to come into play, while incorporating traditional SEM ways of working.           6.  Provide opportunities to participate in SEM activities.\r\n          7.  Develop an awareness of the breadth of SEM career opportunities.\r\n          8.  Create a school, home and community climate conducive to choosing a life in SEM.\r\n     These objectives are addressed through a program that creates a no-fail, multi-disciplinary science project on a topical problem - cosmetic design.  The project is carried out in the laboratories of women science faculty at Rutgers University.  The girls work side by side with faculty on real and relevant problems.  They are paid well, counseled, and introduced to financially successful women in SEM.  And, to produce climate change, their achievement and potential are repeatedly acknowledged in front of the various adults in their lives.\r\n     Working with post-ninth grade girls, their sisters, their family and community leaders, the GEMS intervention focuses on a total of 1,167 participants over three years.  \r\n",
