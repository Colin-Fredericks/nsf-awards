 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe goal of this project is to find out how strategic considerations of political parties affect women's parliamentary participation.  The grant is used to support a comparative study of six OECD countries:  Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, and the United States.  The first component of the project is in-depth, qualitative interviews with 54 party officials (two from each significant party) in each of these countries.  The interview data clarify whether three factors -- the salience of women's issues in the media, party ideology, and the rise of egalitarian new parties -- produce strategic inventives for political parties to promote women.\r\n\tThe second component of the project is the distribution of 2,430 multiple-choice questionnaires to all members of parliament (MPs) in these six countries.  The responses of the MPs to the questions concerning the impact of the three factors mentioned above is analyzed to find out if they are correlated statistically with the party's performance in recruiting female MPs.\r\n\tBoth of these components are part of a larger project which includes indirect measures of the three factors and time series analysis.  Each part enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie gender equality in our parliaments.  Thus, each is a step toward developing effective strategies to improve our democracies.\r\n",
