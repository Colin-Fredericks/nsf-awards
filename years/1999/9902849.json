 "awd_abstract_narration": "9902849\r\nWilkinson\r\n\r\nAvailable data on ages, areas, thicknesses, and volumes of sedimentary rock on continents, and on ages and areas of sedimentary rock actually exposed at the Earth's surface, indicate that decrease in map area with increasing age takes place almost an order of magnitude faster than decrease in total sequence area or volume.  This difference reflects the fact that map area is \"destroyed\" both by erosion and burial by younger units, whereas total reservoir extent is only modified by erosion.  The difference however,\r\nallows for direct estimation of decreasing intensity of cycling rate as a function of increasing sequence age.  At present, estimates of total reservoir size on all continents except Antarctica are adequate to discriminate eon-scale rates of destruction.  Conversely, data on areas and ages of exposed sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic reservoirs have only been coarsely determined, and significant improvement in the precision of these estimates can be accomplished with a modest amount of effort.\r\nTherefore, we will compile a global database on areas and ages of exposed rocks from the most currently available geological maps of the Earth, and major continental land masses.  Many of these recently released compilations are in digital format and are amenable to quantitative evaluation using commercially available software packages.  Results of\r\nthese efforts will embody age-corrected assessment of epoch-scale rates of rock cycling on continental crust, as well as estimates of secular variation in cycling rate as a function of global eustasy, tectonic setting, and paleolatitude.\r\n\r\n",
