 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dvir\r\n\r\nAmple evidence indicates that RNA polymerase II, immediately after initiating transcription and before becoming engaged in elongation, undergoes a significant physical transition. During this early stage, referred to as promoter escape, the transcription complex is relatively unstable and transcription is characterized by a significant extent of premature termination (abortive transcription). Recently it was discovered that early elongation complexes are susceptible to promoter-proximal arrest in the absence of ATP or the general transcription factor TFIIH. In addition, it was found that a downstream DNA region extending to position +35 to +45 relative to the transcription start site is required for promoter escape. The mechanism by which either of the above cofactors facilitates promoter escape remains to be determined. The principal objectives of the project are to analyze the effect of promoter DNA sequences on promoter escape and to examine the capacity of downstream promoter-DNA sequences to interact with specific proteins of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex. These goals will be accomplished by conducting site-directed mutagenesis of promoter sequences and by studies that include chemical crosslinking between the DNA template and DNA-bound proteins. This research will be carried out entirely in vitro using a purified, reconstituted enzyme system. These studies will increase our understanding of the biochemistry of mRNA synthesis, and will provide new insight into the evaluation of class II promoters.\r\n\r\nMessenger RNA is copied from DNA by an enzyme complex including RNA polymerase II, and the beginning of this process can be divided into distinct initiation and elongation phases. The purpose of this project is to examine the role of a particular protein, TFIIH, in facilitating the transition from initiation to elongation. In addition,  the role of DNA sequences on both sides of the initiation site will be examined. These studies will increase our understanding of an important process which is required for the expression of all eukaryotic genes.\r\n",
