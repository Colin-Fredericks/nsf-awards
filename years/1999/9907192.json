This longstanding conference has traditionally brought\r\ntogether researchers from physical, organic, and quantum chemistry,\r\natmospheric and geosciences, and biological sciences.  The conferees of\r\nthis meeting consist of (1) scientists with theoretical and physical\r\ninterests, (2) researchers interested in the atomic-level understanding of\r\nchemical structure and reaction rate and, (3) experimentalists with\r\nbiochemical and biological interests and, (4) scientists who apply isotopic\r\nmethods to earth, atmosphere and archaeology problems.  The uniting theme\r\nis the application of isotopic methods to solve important scientific\r\nproblems.  As a result of its interdisciplinary nature, the Conference has\r\nserved as a breeding ground for the generation of new concepts,\r\nmethodologies and theories in these fields.  Examples include the\r\nremarkable applications of isotopes to enzymatic reactions, including the\r\nrole of nuclear tunneling in enzyme reactions; magnetic field effects in\r\nenzymatic reactions; and the recent successes in understanding enzymatic\r\ntransition states.  The discoveries of anomalies in the oxygen isotope\r\nratios in the upper atmosphere have stimulated theoreticians to develop a\r\nnew theory of chemical reactivity.  Nuclear size and shape explain the\r\nanomalies in the isotope exchange equilibria involving heavy elements,\r\nunexplained for a half century.  In recent years, the Conference has\r\ndemonstrated its usefulness in bridging applications of isotopes between\r\nchemical and biological systems.  This trend is reflected in the current\r\nprogram, which includes new aspects of hydrogen transfer in catalysis, both\r\nin chemical and in enzyme systems.  This year's program also explores\r\nrecently developed techniques for characterization and quantization of the\r\nisotopic phenomena.  Four examples are ultra-sensitive carbon dating by\r\naccelerator mass spectrometry, direct methods of measuring kinetic isotope\r\neffects, pressure-dependence of isotope effects to establish proton\r\ntunneling and NMR methods to establish low-barrier hydrogen bonds.  The\r\natmospheric geosciences address ozone layer chemistry by means of new\r\nisotopic data and mechanistic explanations.  One particularly strong\r\ncomponent of this Conference is that it provides a continuing format for\r\nthe interaction of theoreticians with experimentalists.\r\n\r\nNature has provided scientists with useful tools to investigate natural\r\nprocesses in biological and chemical changes.  Isotopes of normal atoms are\r\ncreated in stars, in space, at the boundaries of space and in research\r\nlaboratories.  They can be used to report on the age of fossils, the nature\r\nof ozone reactions in the stratosphere and the functions of molecules in\r\nliving cells.  Every second year, scientists from diverse areas of research\r\ngather to discuss advances in the use of isotopes to discover new\r\nknowledge.  Advances in technology for the use of isotopes, and isotopic\r\napplication to important problems in biology are shared with scientists\r\nfrom around the globe.  The Gordon Research Conference - \"Isotopes in\r\nBiological and Chemical Sciences\" provides a forum for information exchange\r\nbetween theoretical and experimental sciences, preparing both for new\r\nadvances at the frontiers of science.\r\n\r\n\t\r\n",
