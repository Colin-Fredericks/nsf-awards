 "awd_abstract_narration": "Composite steel and concrete members are increasingly used worldwide in the primary structural systems for building structures.  These structures are designed to take advantage of the properties of both steel and concrete.  In early summer 2000, approximately 100 researchers are gathering in Banff, Canada for a conference sponsored by the United Engineering Foundation to exchange the latest, detailed research findings and present recent case studies relating to innovations in composite construction.  This gathering presents a unique opportunity to hold a symposium to provide a substantive summary and exchange of worldwide research in composite construction, so as to establish firmly the state-of-the-art in this area, and to help identify research needs for the next several years.  The symposium will permit international researchers and practitioners to summarize current worldwide advances and forsee trends in innovative composite construction for building structures, with one emphasis of the symposium being on the large amount of research that has taken place in the U..S. Japan, and other countries in the area of seismic resistance of structures.\r\n",
