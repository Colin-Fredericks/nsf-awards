 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the publication of Darwin's Descent of Man, the biological study of human nature has been confronted with enormous critical risistance and, though the context has changed since the 19th century, these debates still rage.  The conference to be supported by this grant will bring together scholars from many disciplines who have taken part in these debates (though never together) to analyze the impact of recent research in biology and related fields on discussions of human nature.  More specifically, as philosophers of science will come together with biologists, anthropologists, and psychologist, the interplay of different disciplinary perspectives will (the conference organizers hope) precipitate new avenues of research and will dispel some all-too-common recent misconceptions about biological approaches to human nature.  Specific topics to be discussed include the implications of the results from primatology for the study of human behvaior and morality; the evolution of altruism; sex and sexuality; evolutionary psychology; and genes and behavior.  The participants range in academic rank form beginning assistant professor to full professor.",
