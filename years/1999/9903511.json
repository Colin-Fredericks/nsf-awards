Illuminated semiconductors have been successfully used in environmental remediation for a wide range of organic compounds and heavy metals in aqueous solution.  This ambient temperature process catalyzes oxidation and reduction reactions when TiO2 is illuminated with ultraviolet light.  The efficiency of these reactions is improved through controlled periodic illumination (CPI).  The goals of this study are to evaluate the use of CPI in TiO2 photocatalysis to improve yields and selectivity for chemical production and to test the hypothesis that oxygen sorption/electron transfer is the rate-limiting reaction step when using CPI in oxygen reduction reactions.  The photocatalytic cyclization of L-lysine to form L-pipecolinic acid will be studied.  The mechanism has been proposed to follow two pathways: one forming the desired L-isomer and the other forming a racemic mixture of pipecolinic acid.  The initial step in the proposed mechanism is the selective oxidation of one of the amino groups by the photogenerated holes.  CPI may affect the selectivity through changes in the initial oxidation or through changes in the relative rates of the remaining steps in the proposed pathways.  In a second series of experiments with oxygen reduction, operating conditions will be changed so that effects of oxygen adsorption and transfer of the conduction band electron to the adsorbed oxygen can be determined.  Changes in oxygen pressure and platinum loading will also be used to determine rate-limiting effects.\r\n",
