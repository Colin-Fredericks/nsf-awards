 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nOrganisms protect themselves from numerous environmental stresses using the heat shock response, which includes an increase in the abundance of heat shock proteins (HSPs).  Some of these HSPs serve as molecular chaparones to allow proteins to retain the 3-dimensional structure necessary for protein function.  Much work has been done on the cell and molecular biology of HSPs.  This symposium will assess the role of HSPs in nature and the evolution of HSPs and the heat shock response.  Some speakers will address the role of HSPs in organismal tolerance to heat, hibernation, response to parasitism and in normal development and aging processes.  Other participants will emphasize the expression of HSPs in organisms in nature, the cost and benefits of HSP expression and the evolution of HSP genes.  The symposium will facilitate discussion, interaction and collaboration among scientists in diverse disciplines who are studying this important biological issue.  The symposium will review the current state of knowledge about HSPs in organismal biology and highlight unanswered questions.  By doing so, it will determine future research directions.\r\n",
