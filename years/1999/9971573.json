The research seeks to develop simulation techniques to describe macroscopic magnetic properties, such as hysteresis loops, of materials where these are influenced by atomic-scale defects.  In films of thickness 5-50 nm, the influence of defects in nucleating domains or pinning domain walls prevents ordinary micromagnetic simulations from achieving quantitative accuracy without introducing adjustable parameters.  Technologically important materials,e.g. magnetic recording media and permanent magnets, exhibit behavior that is strongly defect driven.  With increasing storage density, the resistance of the material to exhibiting superparamagentism depends on the interaction between thermal fluctuations and defects.  To enable the reliable simulation of the magnetic properties of these materials, the PIs will use simulation techniques that include thermal fluctuations and information on defects (local exchange and anisotropy) obtained from electronic structure calculations. \r\n\r\nThis award supports a research effort that addresses fundamental problems as well as problems of interest to magnetic recording and data storage industries.  It is a collaborative effort between the University of Minnesota and Tulane University.  The PIs seek to develop methods to include information from atomic-scale calculations in computer simulations of large-scale magnetic properties of materials for which defects play an important role.  The research contributes to the training of students in electronic structure and simulation techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
