 "awd_abstract_narration": "Considering the size of the United States construction industry and the human exposure to injury or illness, relatively little work has been conducted in the area of construction safety and very few studies discuss the actual relationships among construction trades and injuries or illnesses.  The dollar amount or compensation weeks awarded for an injury serves as the most direct measure for cost of safety.  Due to inflationary trends in medical expenses and legal proceedings, the cost of safety is continually on the rise.  Thus there is growing interest from safety professionals, insurance carriers and government agencies to analyze the potential impacts of specific accident related injuries and illnesses on the burden of cost to the construction industry and the society at large.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will focus on the construction industry, and will develop models to predict the losses in units of compensation weeks or dollars for a given source and nature of injury or illness, accident and\r\ndisability type, part of body involved, occupation, and the age of injured.  The New York State Workers' Compensation data containing 91,953 records closed between 1980 and 1988 will serve as the source for the research data.  Predictive models will be developed using Recursive Partitioning, a nonparametric statistical tool that produces a binary decision tree representation for classification and regression problems.   Apart from its conceptual appeal and ready interpretability, the major advantages of Recursive Partitioning are its ability to analyze complex interactions and nonlinearity among many variables by effectively reducing the dimensionality of the data and natural ways to deal with missing data. The proposed research will produce tree-structured models for potential use by contractors, insurance carriers, safety professionals and government agencies and regulators. Insurance providers may utilize these trees to determine the potential impact of a reported injury or illness. Contractors may use these to ascertain whether the proper amount of reserve is being retained by their insurance provider. Such analyses will prove beneficial to the contractor in planning for associated costs and replacement of injured workers.\r\n\r\nThe PI for the proposed project is an Assistant Professor at the Center for Healthcare Effectiveness Research at Wayne State University (WSU).  During the past three years she held a non-tenure-track position which carried with it an enormous service workload that impeded her scholarly and creative methods development activities in the area of Statistics.  The POWRE award will permit her to pursue a thriving area of statistical research that will allow career enhancement, and substantively further professional standing with the statistical research community.  The award will be critical to her re-entry into statistical research, and delineate a long-term research program that will help establish her in a tenure-track position and allow\r\nher to be fully competitive for funding through a regular research program.  The POWRE funding mechanism will also permit the investigator to initiate a methodological approach that is completely new to the construction industry literature, thereby fostering collaborations between the PI and the construction research community, and demonstrably impacting the applied field as well.  This POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
