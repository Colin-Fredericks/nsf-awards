 "awd_abstract_narration": "Award Abstract - 9977377\r\n\r\nFunctional Ecology is an integrative and interdisciplinary field that considers the biochemical, morphological and physiological bases of ecological processes, interactions and potential adaptations of organisms.  Studies of Functional Ecology span levels of organization from parts of individuals through ecosystems.  Although the field of Functional Ecology by its nature is integrative and interdisciplinary, much of the research traditionally progressed along separate taxonomic lines.  Animal and plant studies have followed different trajectories, and, because of tradition in both training and research, few researchers work on both animal and plant systems.  Similar divisions have occurred between terrestrial and aquatic systems, for both freshwater and marine systems.  In addition, research into areas of physiological function is traditionally separate from studies of morphological and behavioral function.\r\nFunctional Ecology research is equipment and technology dependent, much like Molecular Biology.  Share use of expensive equipment, research collaborations among scientists with different areas of expertise, and mutual training of students in a single facility has proven to be very successful for students and researchers.  This award will be used to develop a multi-user facility dedicated to research, training, and education in Functional Ecology.  This facility will fill a crucial need in training in the area of Functional Ecology by providing equipment that can be used by a variety of researchers and students whose analytical needs overlap and whose research areas are complementary.  The Ecology and Evolution Department at Stony Brook has a strong group of researchers in this field.  A core facility housed in a common lab space will significantly enhance research capabilities, facilitate research collaboration, and will improve capacity to train both undergraduate and graduate students in the modern analytical methods are essential for Functional Ecology.\r\n",
