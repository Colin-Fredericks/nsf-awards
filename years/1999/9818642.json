 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to study the effect of irreversible investment in pollution abatement capital, irreversible stocks of greenhouse gases, avoidable, and potentially catastrophic, damages, and future learning about the nature of damages, on the optimal rate of emission of greenhouse gases. Abatement capital is said to be irreversible if resources once invested cannot be re-used for consumption or re-invested in other forms of capital. The stock of greenhouse gases is said to be irreversible if it cannot be reduced through abatement and if it does not decay naturally (climatologists report that about 13-18 % of the total carbon dioxide emitted will remain in the atmosphere for several thousands of years). Damages are avoidable if the probability of damages depends on the stock of greenhouse gases and catastrophic if there are sharp jumps in the damage function. Given these features of the economic environment and the possibility of learning about damages in the future, the investigators propose to analyze whether or not policymakers should change the rate at which greenhouse gases are being emitted today. It is reasonable to conjecture that the presence of irreversible capital should lead to lower investment today and that irreversible stocks of greenhouse gases and avoidable, and potentially catastrophic, damages should induce higher investment. Learning about future damages should reinforce these results.\r\n     Previous studies have found that, perhaps counter to intuition, irreversible stocks of greenhouse gases have either a zero or positive effect on the desired level of emissions today. In preliminary work the investigators show that this result is driven by the definitions of irreversible capital and irreversible stocks of greenhouse gases, and an implicit assumption that the risk of damages is not avoidable. The investigators develop a theoretical model and suggest different definitions that imply a stronger irreversibility effect for the stock of greenhouse gases and a weaker effect for capital. Adding avoidable risk to the model strengthens these results. The theoretical model does not allow agents to act on new information on the nature of damages. A numerical model, a parameterization of the theoretical model, that allows agents to act on new information about the nature of damages, suggests that, with unavoidable risk, irreversible capital leads to a decrease in investment while irreversible stocks of greenhouse gases lead to an increase. Avoidable risk counters the effect of irreversible capital and strengthens the effect of irreversible stocks of greenhouse gases.\r\n     The investigators propose to build on this work in three important ways: (i) by introducing learning into the analytical model; (ii) by developing estimates of cost or production functions for reducing emissions and ambient concentrations of greenhouse gases, and also an estimate of the catastrophe probability function to use in simulations; and (iii) by adapting and extending a large scale, empirically realistic simulation model (Nordhaus' DICE model), to incorporate the novel features of their analytical model and their illustrative simulations. This will provide credible estimates of the relative magnitudes of the irreversibility effects associated with capital, the stock of greenhouse gases, and avoidable risk, and yield implications for current policy on control of greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n\r\n",
