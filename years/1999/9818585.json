Preliminary data suggests that these spatial heterogeneities probably control the short-time polymer dynamics.  The proposed studies fall in three general categories.  First, measurements will be carried out to enable comparison of the relaxation time spectrum breadths for several polymers initially in glass-forming solvents (dilute-solution conditions), with the relaxation time spectrum breadths for the same polymers as unentangled melts.  (Preliminary data suggests that there are major differences: a given polymer appears to be much more flexible in melt form.)  Second, the shortest polymer relaxation time, together with the effective viscosity of the solvating liquid, will be determined as functions of polymer molecular weight (low M) and concentration for as many different polymer/glass-forming liquid combinations as time, instrumental limitations, and personnel permit.  Third, examination of time-temperature superposition parameters and effective high-frequency oscillatory flow birefringence and/or viscoelastic properties for the same dilute polymer solutions as functions of polymer molecular weight (low M) and concentration will provide additional important information regarding the spatial dimensions of apparent dynamic heterogeneities in these liquids.  The above chain dynamics information will be obtained from oscillatory flow birefringence and/or viscoelasticity studies employing unique custom instrumentation.  All of the above, taken together, may provide reasonable estimates of correlation lengths and correlation lifetimes- and hopefully their temperature dependences- for glass-forming liquids.\r\n%%%\r\nThese studies should determine whether or not apparent \"polymer flexibility\" obtained from dynamics studies of polymer solutions is actually a reflection of dynamic spatial heterogeneity in the solvent.  If it is, as very preliminary results suggest, it should provide a simple and convenient method for obtaining \"cluster size\" and \"cluster-lifetimes\" for such liquids, and may result in a much improved understanding of the role of polymer additives in lubricants and motor oils, enabling the development of substantially improved products.  In addition, for polymers with large numbers of short branches, it may markedly improve branching characterization by means of chain-dynamics-sensing experiments.  This work will be the thesis research for graduate students specializing in polymer chemistry.\r\n***   \r\n",
