 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will fund graduate student participation in a workshop \r\non \"Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations and Applications to \r\nMaterials\", to be held April 30 -- May 2, 1999 at the University of\r\nMinnesota.  The speakers invited to the workshop will include modelers, \r\nmathematical analysts, numerical analysts and materials scientists. \r\nSpecific topics which may be expected to come under discussion include \r\nmicrostructure, multiple time scales, widely varying length scales, \r\nviscosity methods and nonlinear homogenization.  All of these topics \r\nhave proved to be of value in mathematical models of materials.  \r\n\r\nThis will be a thoroughly interdisciplinary workshop, in which \r\nexperts from rather different scientific disciplines (materials \r\nscience, computer science, solid-state physics and mathematics) \r\nwill be brought together to discuss problems they have encountered \r\nseparately, but may have approached using only the tools which are \r\nfamiliar to their specialized scientific group.  In this way, the \r\npower (and limitations) of these tools will be made clear to other \r\nexperts and to the graduate students present.  Mathematicians need \r\nto be well informed about the insights which have emerged from the \r\nstudy of materials, and materials scientists need to learn about \r\nthe best techniques which have emerged from mathematical investigations.  \r\nTalented graduate students from across the country who are planning \r\nto work in areas related to the workshop will be encouraged to apply \r\nfor support so they may attend.  The graduate students of today, who \r\nwill become the research leaders of tomorrow, will benefit deeply from \r\nobserving at first hand this interaction of mathematical theory \r\nwith an important area of application.\r\n",
