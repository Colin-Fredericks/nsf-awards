 "awd_abstract_narration": "In high-speed and high-precision machining, the interactions between the cutting tool and the workpiece are extremely important and complex.  They affect tool life, process economics, and surface integrity of the machined product.  To understand these interactions, finite element method (FEM) based metal flow simulation techniques will be used to establish the effect of process conditions (feed rate, depth of cut, cutting speed) upon cutting forces, tool temperatures and stresses, and tool failure.  The project consists of the following tasks:  (1) Orthogonal turning and milling tests will be conducted to establish a methodology for determining the flow stress data under high strain rate, strain and temperature conditions encountered in machining; (2) A computer program will be developed to predict forces, stresses, and temperatures in three-dimensional practical machining processes such as face milling, drilling, and ball-end milling; and (3) A wear model will be validated to predict tool wear in function of process variables and tool material and coating.  Modeling techniques based on the physics of the cutting process will be used to demonstrate how to estimate tool wear, improve tool and insert design, and optimize process conditions.\r\n     The results of this project are expected to contribute significantly to the fundamental understanding of metal cutting operations;  and,  reducing the amount of experimentation needed to establish and optimize high speed machining operations in an industrial environment.\r\n",
