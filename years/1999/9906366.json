This project will continue an earlier three-year experimental study of oak herbivore populations in which nutrients and bird-predation pressure had been manipulated in a factorial design. Initial results had differed from previous terrestrial experimental studies and the present project will seek to explain those differences among studies by considering different size classes of trees.  It will specifically test whether top-down effects occur on large but not small saplings, the relative strength of top-down forces with increasing nutrient availability, and the existence of a time lag in the generation of top-down forces on herbivores from the arthropod predator community.  This study will contribute to the understanding of the trophic dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems.  It will also provide an opportunity for numerous undergraduate students to gain a substantial research experience.\r\n",
