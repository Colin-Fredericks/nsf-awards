 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular biology laboratory experiences adapted from those developed at the University of Arizona (The Biology Project: http://www.blc.arizona.edu/instructions.html) are being introduced into the community college environment.  Students are gaining hands-on experience with techniques presently used in biotechnology. Emphasis is on the role of molecular biology in the future of the human environment and medicine and the effect of biotechnology on the enrichment of agriculture. The laboratory experiments focus on DNA Restriction Analysis; Recombinant DNA Technology; Reverse Transcriptase; and Polymerase Chain Reaction and are being integrated into three courses: Environmental Science, College Biology I & 11, and Microbiology.  Laboratory investigations are being adapted to result in three significant outcomes: allow students a better understanding of abstract and esoteric concepts that previously have been confined to the lecture setting; increase enrollment and retention rates of science majors through hands-on experiences; and allow highly-qualified students to enroll for honors credit.    The impact of the laboratories on understanding and retention will be assessed and the information disseminated.\r\n\r\n",
