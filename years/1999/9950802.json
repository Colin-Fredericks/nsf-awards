 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project adapts the laboratory based course \"Physics of Lasers and Modern Optics\"  (PLMO), developed for engineering majors at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, to a student audience composed physics/engineering majors, one third of whom plan to teach at the secondary level.   Adaptation of the University of Nebraska laboratory manual (published, University of Nebraska) in a junior level optics course is organized around the laser optics. The implementation plan includes a revision of PLMO modules (laser safety , polarization, and holography) to embed discovery based learning activities and strategies.  In addition, experiments in related areas (optical fibers, diode lasers) and experiments based on ideas suggested but not included in PLMO (interference, coherence) are developed in this project to expand the suite of materials available in optics.  Interferometry, not covered in the PLMO manual, is treated as an important tool and is introduced early in the proposed course and used frequently later in the discussion of such topics as spatial and temporal coherence, thin film interference, and spectroscopic methods.  The proposed course is taught in a discovery based manner, allowing for the open ended inquiry which has been demonstrated as effective for the training of science teachers.  The course takes place entirely in the laboratory and is designed to facilitate a student's ability to answer questions about optical phenomena using both simple equipment and contemporary instruments and software.  Special mechanisms are in place to address the needs of the physics majors who are preservice teachers.  Seminar meetings provide the opportunity to discuss and critique materials suitable for use in the precollege classroom in the area of optics. The proposed program involves the use, wherever possible, of inexpensive equipment suitable for the secondary classroom as recommended in physics education literature [Kallard, Exploring Laser Light; Shenoy, American Journal of Physics, 1994 and others].  Each  instructional unit is introduced using inexpensive equipment and the more expensive commercial and home built instrumentation is introduced as needed.  Commercial optical simulation software is available for student use throughout the course.",
