This project focuses on understanding the factors that limit genetic exchange in a well-studied insect hybrid zone.  One possibility is that incompatibility between two cricket species is induced by the bacterium Wolbachia, which is known to infect the reproductive tissues of many insect species.  The work involves surveys of presence/absence of Wolbachia in crickets of two hybridizing species, and molecular analyses to determine whether different bacterial strains are present.  Incompatibility occurs when males are infected and females are not or when they are infected with different strains.  A second component of the research takes advantage of recently developed molecular markers to determine, through laboratory hybridization experiments, whether barriers to gene exchange in nature are also the result of behavioral differences or differences in sperm viability. \r\n\tStudies of hybrid zones and of barriers that limit gene exchange between species provide important insights into how new species arise and what maintains species differences in natural systems.  Insects are important models for such studies, both because they are a remarkably diverse group and because they are easy to work with in experimental situations.  The present study focuses on barriers to gene exchange that are thought to be of general importance in insect speciation.  However, additional case studies like this one are needed to confirm or reject this generalization.\r\n\t\r\n",
