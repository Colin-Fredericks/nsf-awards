 "awd_abstract_narration": "Malshe\r\nEPS-9977830\r\nThis project will establish a distributed Center of Excellence for \"Durable Miniaturized Systems.\"  Research on nano and micro systems engineering is leading to fundamental changes in various applications that require miniaturized systems such as automobiles, aerospace vehicles, bio-medicine, informatics, high performance computing, etc.  Miniaturized systems affect important areas such as efficiency, portability, cost efficiency, durability, as well as configurability, evolutionary and intelligent decision-making abilities, and real-time interacting.  Since surface-to-volume ratio increases significantly in miniaturized systems, performance of these systems depends in large part, on the integration of surfaces and interfaces.  Therefore, the research associated with the \"durability\" of such nano and micro systems is critical insofar as the development of durable miniaturized products is concerned in the coming century.  The nature of the distributed activity will be to address various areas of physics, chemistry and engineering in these systems having to do with fabrication processes, systems handling, particulate surface matter, friction and wear, encapsulation and aging. Test structures will be designed, as will novel prototyping and manufacturing methods related to friction and wear of surfaces and interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe proposed distributed research Center is a collaborative effort in research and education between the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, which will serve to broaden opportunities for students and researchers to spend time in laboratories and share equipment.  Together with establishing a particular research and education program, the project also seeks to establish a successful cross campus management scheme, and build a critical mass of investigators to establish the Center.  The program will also include collaborations with Sandia Labs and members of industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
