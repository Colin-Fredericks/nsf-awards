 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose the continuation of all interdisciplinary REU program, Research Internships in Neural and Behavioral Sciences, for 10 Native American, Hispanic, and African American students, and White students who are the first generation of their family in college. Under the guidance of scientists from the Department of Biological Sciences and the Department of psychology, students will conduct research in neural and behavioral sciences.\r\nThis 10-week summer research internship integrates four major components: (1) Faculty mentors provide hands-on research experience to students in faculty laboratories, fostering the excitement of scientific discovery. (2) In an orientation program, students receive instruction in laboratory techniques in the neural and behavioral sciences. (3) Professional development seminars are presented covering topics such as how to apply to graduate school. (4) NAU faculty present discussions of ethical issues in science.\r\nWe seek funding so that we may continue to prepare minority students and other students who are first generation of their families in college for graduate admission in the Neural and Behavioral Sciences. We will continue to refine our program based on evaluation results, the input of faculty mentors and current and former students, and the findings of social and educational research.\r\n",
