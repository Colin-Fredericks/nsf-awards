The initial research focus will be on outbreeding depression: the phenomenon of reduced fitness in interpopulation hybrids. This will involve a 3-pronged approach. First, genetic mechanisms underlying outbreeding depression will be assessed via breeding studies and molecular analyses using the microcrustacean Tigriopus californicus, a species in which interpopulation hybridization has been shown to result in substantially reduced fitness. Second, the generality of outbreeding depression will be assessed by measuring fitness consequences of interpopulation hybridization in other organisms, beginning with a study of an intertidal fish species. Third, computer simulations will be used to determine factors contributing to outbreeding depression.\r\n\r\nOutbreeding depression is of considerable interest to conservation biologists because the frequency of interpopulation transfers is increasing, due both to accidental introductions and planned attempts to bolster population size.  Meanwhile, the fitness consequences of this population mixing remain largely unknown. The phenomenon is also of great interest to those studying speciation, because it marks the first stage of reproductive isolation.  Understanding the process of speciation is extremely important to those interested in preserving biodiversity.\r\n\r\n",
