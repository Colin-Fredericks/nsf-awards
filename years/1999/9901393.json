The overriding theme of this proposal concerns the investigation of the preparation, structural aspects, and chemical propeties of dendrimers that have been internally and externally modified via (1) combinatorial techinques to examine functional group cooperativity within branced architectures and (2) the incorporation of metal ligand binding sites for the construction of \"higher order\" dendritic networks and arrays.  Pursuant to this goal are the design and synthersis of application-oriented dendrimers accessed form utilitarian dendritic building blocks that can be prepared via directed- or statictical-type reaction shcemes and are based on well documented synthetic transformations.  Combinatorial techinques will facilitate the construction of novel dendrimer families possessing constitutionally diverse fundtionality.  Dendrimer construction efficiency and usefulness of the combinatorial techinique will be assessed by material analysis for catalytic activity(e.g., phosphate ester hydrolysis).  Use of the internally modified dendrimers for the preparation of novel materials will also be exemplified by the modular construction of dendritic assemblies and networks.  Network preparation will be facilitated by the propensity of tetrahedral units to self-assemble when appropriately functionalized and the strict geometric positional control of binding lici provided by the iterative synthetic method.  Metal complex formation will be employed for the connectivity of the ordered arrays.  Project goals include:\r\n\r\nExploration of the potential physicochemical properties and applications of internal dendritic    environments.\r\n\r\nConstruction of functionally diverse dendrivers for use as recoverable, hydrolytic catalysts.\r\n\r\nConstruction of dendrimers with compartmentalized moieties capable of forming connections with other     dendrimers.\r\n\r\nPreparation of functionally derivatized dendritic building blocks and dendrivers that are capable of being     used to demonstrate surface functional group mobility.\r\n\r\nCombinatorial construction of dendrivers to meld the best traits of hypebranched and classical dendritic     synthetic techniques.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research combines study of the chemistry associated with physicochemical properties of highly branched, specifically designed, macromolecule, with the attendant utility inherent in those properties.  Results of this research will expand foundations for understanding of chemical phenomena occurring within \"designer\" reaction environments.\r\n",
