 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project  will experimentally demonstrate that a tabletop point x-ray source reduces exposure time by a factor of at least 100.  The university partners in this project have demonstrated deep-sub-100 nm nanolithography using soft x-rays which enables fabrication of complex nanostructures with precision and accuracy on planar substrates.  However, the potential of soft x-ray nanolithography has been severely limited by the lack of inexpensive soft x-ray exposure tools.  Electron-bombardment point sources, which are currently used, have low power and efficiencies of O.01%. As a result, it takes several hours to complete an exposure.  SRL and its university partner propose to build a tabletop, dense plasma focus, x-ray exposure source that will have efficiencies of 1-2%.  The plasma source, which will be capable of radiating 10-20 watts of usable soft x-rays into 4  steradians, will reduce the exposure time by a factor of 100 or more.   In Phase II, SRL will fabricate a 100 pps source with the goal of creating a compact package that can be commercialized.  \r\n     Deep-sub 100 nm lithography has potential applications in the biological sciences, thin films, optical components, displays and sensors, nanoelectronics and the organization and manipulation of macromolecules and nanoparticles.  In addition, a high power, kilowatt-class x-ray point source would provide a modular, affordable proximity source for x-ray lithography. The commercial market for non-semiconductor applications is predicted to be greater than $200 million annually.  A low cost, compact deep-sub-100nm lithography system is essential to exploiting these applications.",
