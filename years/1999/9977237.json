 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Michael Glascock and Hector Neff will purchase a VG Axiom single collector high resolution ICP-Mass Spectrometer system and related components as well as a VG MicroProbe II laser ablation system. Like INAA which the laboratory now employs, inductively-coupled mass spectroscopy is capable of high-sensitivity, high-resolution multi-element characterization of geological materials including glass, metal, lithics and ceramics which are often the focus of archaeological provenance investigations. ICP-MS also permits the direct determination of isotope ratios which will further enhance the provenance determination capabilities of the laboratory.\r\n\r\nSince 1988 the University of Missouri Archaeometry Lab directed by Drs. Glascock and Neff has received NSF funding to subsidize the cost of INAA for archaeological applications by researchers at US universities and research institutes. This has allowed involvement in approximately 200 collaborative research projects with archaeologists and  completion of over 40,000 neutron activation analyses of a range of archaeological materials. In the process over 80 students from multiple institutions have been trained and this has led to 28 graduate degrees. Provenience determination of materials from archaeological sites permits insight into prehistoric mobility and trade networks. On the basis of such information it is often possible to reconstruct subsistence, economic and political systems. Therefore a wide range of archeologists who work with different materials from multiple time periods in many parts of the world have relied on the Missouri laboratory for sourcing data. ICP-MS provides a less expensive approach to trace element analysis; an additional advantage is the ability to determine isotope ratios. With an ICP-MS the range of archaeological services provided by the laboratory will be increased.\r\n",
