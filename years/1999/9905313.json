 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the accumulation, storage, and transport of heat in a stream network by applying geographical techniques and concepts.  In 1998, 1067 (13,892 river miles) of the 2375 streams and rivers surveyed in Oregon were designated as having limited water quality; most of these streams (81%) were listed because summer maximum temperatures exceeded the standards set for maintaining the historic cold water fisheries.  This project will clarify which factors control stream temperature patterns at all locations in a stream network.  Four major factors will be considered: (1) shading by vegetation and topography, (2) fluxes of sensible heat and subsurface water from adjacent landforms or deep groundwater sources, (3) exchange of stream water with the hyporheic zone, and (4) inputs from upstream reaches.  Spatially explicit hypotheses about factors controlling patterns of stream temperature will be developed and tested using existing GIS layers and spatially-distributed field measurements of stream, air, and soil temperatures and discharge.  Between 50 to 100 locations will be studied in a 62 square-kilometer forested basin in the western Cascades of Oregon.  Inferences drawn from this analysis will be corroborated with selected heat balance calculations and spatial statistical analyses to eliminate spurious correlations.  Findings will be summarized in schematic diagrams depicting the types, sizes, and spatial arrangements of controls on stream temperature. \r\n\r\n This project will produce a generalized, transferable approach to understanding how the spatial arrangements of above-ground and below-ground landscape attributes (i.e. vegetation and topography versus geomorphic features) control patterns of stream temperatures in a drainage network.  Such an approach is relevant to the scientific goal of developing process-based conceptual models of the function of networks in landscapes, and also to the societal need for approaches to preparing federally- and state-mandated water quality management plans to remediate water quality violations caused by extreme stream temperatures. Current laws require landowners along \"temperature-limited\" streams to devise plans to reduce stream temperatures; uncertainty surrounding the factors causing elevated stream temperatures may exacerbate social tensions among landowners.  Using maps and field measurements, the results of this study will demonstrate how different types of streams in different locations may be more or less susceptible to increased temperature from vegetation removal or other landuse changes.  The project also is expected to demonstrate how land use modifications may or may not help reduce stream temperatures in various locations. \r\n\r\n",
