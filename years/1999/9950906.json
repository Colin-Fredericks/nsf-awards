 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a suite of web-based multimedia courseware to simulate soil laboratory tests in geotechnical engineering. The benefits of this courseware include enhancing learning, retention and transfer of learning, improving the connection between theory, experiments and applications, making laboratory exercises possible at remote locations, and use of effective pedagogical strategies.\r\n\r\nInteractions are coded in the courseware to recall prior knowledge, to stimulate learning and to test learning outcomes. The courseware simulates all the procedures that a student will normally perform in a laboratory class. Each student has his or her own virtual apparatus to conduct not only the standard test but also a variety of tests that existing equipment cannot accommodate. The consolidation, triaxial, direct shear and simple shear tests would be simulated. These tests are normally required as part of the curriculum for undergraduate civil engineering students. The courseware is being tested at the University of Illinois, Louisiana State University, Northeastern University, Syracuse University, Texas A & M University and at this University. Evaluation and assessment would be conducted with the help of the Instructional Assessment and Evaluations Services. John Wiley and Sons has agreed to distribute the courseware as a CD-ROM worldwide. The courseware is also on the web.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
