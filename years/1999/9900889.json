 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project will assess the role of the family in creating gender differences in the academic careers of Chinese American students. The influence of family dynamics on Asian American academic achievement has been well-documented. However, the role of gender has largely been overlooked. Compared to their male counterparts, Asian American women are less likely to participate in higher education and to major in math, science and engineering. Yet, when compared to women of other racial and ethnic groups, they are more likely to choose quantitative fields of study. This research seeks to provide a point of departure for shedding light on the processes that create this phenomenon through an examination of family, peers and school. Chinese Americans will be studied because there is a gender gap in educational access, and the population is stratified by economic class, date of entry into the United States, place of origin and nativity status. This research will focus on second-generation Chinese American undergraduates, and will address several questions: (1) To what extent do immigrant parents influence their children's choice of academic major and career plans, and are there gender differences in this influence? (2) How do family background and environment, particularly in relation to migration, affect women and men's educational experiences? (3) To what extent are women's choices related to their interaction with faculty and peers, and social pressures outside the family? This project will explore these questions through in-depth interviews with men and women attending two New York City colleges and their families, as well as through participant observation conducted at school and in the home.",
