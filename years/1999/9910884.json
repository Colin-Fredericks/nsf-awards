 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several studies have found race of interviewer effects in surveys to be pervasive and powerful, especially when the survey concerns racially loaded issues. For a variety of reasons, however, race of interviewer effects are particularly difficult to measure. This project develops and tests a new method for studying such effects under controlled conditions. A computer assisted self-interviewing (CASI) system will have a videotaped interviewer reading survey questions. In this way, the interviewer's race can be systematically varied while other interviewer attributes are held constant. The PIs have prototyped video-CASI systems using existing software. This approach offers important benefits for exploring whether respondents react in the same way to a virtual interviewer as they would to a live interviewer, and for understanding interviewer effects (live or virtual) on the answers respondents give to survey questions about socially sensitive issues. The research involves a laboratory experiment including samples of both white and black subjects. Experimental conditions permit an examination of live interviewers as opposed virtual interviewers of the same race and of opposite race. In addition, a text-CASI self-administered interview group will serve as a control. The results of this work will have relevance on several fronts. First, it evaluates a potentially powerful new tool for studying race of interviewer effects. Second, the implications of the findings go beyond race, and allow the exploration of how attitudes and opinions are shaped by the social context in which they are articulated. Third, the project will explore the extent to which the \"virtual social presence\" of a computer may resemble that of a live person",
