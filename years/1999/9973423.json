 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative interdisciplinary project, the\r\ninvestigators Mark Gockenbach, Anthony Kearsley, and William\r\nSymes develop and implement algorithms for large-scale\r\noptimization problems that arise in a variety of applications,\r\nfocusing on techniques particularly suited to parallel\r\narchitectures, and apply the methods to the seismic velocity\r\nestimation problem.  Large-scale optimization problems often\r\npresent difficulties to standard algorithms and software.  Many\r\nof these difficulties arise in the seismic velocity estimation\r\nproblem.  First, the sheer data volume makes it impractical to\r\nexplicitly form and factor matrices, as required by many standard\r\noptimization algorithms.  To address this, a new matrix-free\r\nSequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm is developed,\r\nbased on recent advances in matrix-free algorithms for the\r\nso-called trust region subproblem.  Second, the data structures\r\nand interfaces required for seismic data processing are not\r\neasily adapted to those required by \"off-the-shelf\" optimization\r\nsoftware.  The Hilbert Class Library (HCL), an object-oriented\r\noptimization package, can solve optimization problems involving\r\ndata structures and interfaces of arbitrary complexity.  The SQP\r\nalgorithm, along with the necessary seismic data structures and\r\nsimulators, is implemented in HCL.  Third, large-scale\r\nsimulations often require the use of parallel computation.  The\r\nuse of parallelism in simulation and optimization is addressed\r\nthrough the development of HCL classes that automatically\r\ndistribute data over a network of distributed workstations.  The\r\nabove innovations in optimization methods and software are used\r\nto study in detail a new formulation of the seismic inverse\r\nproblem.  The investigators have recently introduced this\r\nformulation in order to overcome certain optimization-theoretic\r\ndifficulties inherent in standard formulations.\r\n     Optimization problems arise in science and engineering,\r\nwhere one often wishes to find the best design, the best\r\nmathematical model, the best strategy, and so forth.  Large-scale\r\noptimization problems, which involve many variables, present\r\nspecial challenges, including the choice of algorithm, the\r\nrepresentation of data, and the interface between optimization\r\nsoftware and programs written by the application scientist.  This\r\nproject addresses these challenges in the context of an important\r\napplication, seismic exploration.  The investigator and his\r\ncolleagues develop new optimization algorithms to identify\r\ngeological features of the subsurface of the earth.  Included is\r\na general method for solving large-scale optimization problems;\r\nthis algorithm is applicable to other science and engineering\r\nproblems.  Moreover, they also develop an innovative software\r\npackage, called the Hilbert Class Library (HCL), that allows\r\noptimization algorithms to be used with problems of arbitrary\r\ncomplexity; the software adapts to different data structures and\r\nsoftware interfaces.  Finally, they extend HCL to automatically\r\ntake advantage of parallel computers, making it easier to take\r\nadvantage of high performance hardware.  The seismic exploration\r\nproblem is important to the petroleum industry; a precise\r\nknowledge of geological structures is essential for efficient\r\nutilization of petroleum reserves.  In addition, the HCL software\r\naddresses the important issue of technology transfer as it\r\npertains to numerical algorithms; too often algorithmic advances\r\nare unavailable to application scientists because optimization\r\nsoftware and application software have incompatible interfaces.",
