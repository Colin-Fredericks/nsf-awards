 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will produce a series of exploratory papers on the history of twentieth-century cartography that will form the foundation of Volume Six of The History of Cartography, a multi-volume reference work of the history of mapping in its technological, cultural, and social contexts.  Since very little secondary literature has been written on the twentieth century, the principal investigators will direct the research of eleven scholars chosen from a \"Call for Research Proposals\" for a conference in Summer 2000, at which the types of available sources and the kinds of issues germane to Volume Six will be evaluated. These authors will attend a formal professional meeting at which finished papers based on their findings will be presented in summer 2002. The published proceedings resulting from this meeting-to appear in 2003 in a special double issue of a leading journal-will form the basis of much larger and more fully developed chapters in Volume Six.\r\n\r\nThe research will focus on key technological developments in cartography during the twentieth century. These themes provide a touchstone for many aspects of information science: in information gathering (surveying, global positioning systems, aerial photography, remote sensing), in computer infrastructure and graphic design, and in the access to geospatial information (in map and geographic information science libraries). Alongside these technological changes are many social issues that have shaped cartographic technology and have been shaped by it. Maps are used more widely now than in any other time in history. They are indispensable in our attempts to understand the world views of individuals and societies in both academic and practical senses. They are an important chapter in the history of human cognition and communication, and they are essential in organizing geographical knowledge and in visualizing patterns in geographical data.  Maps are one of science's basic sources for spatial insight.\r\n",
