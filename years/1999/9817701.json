 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Treasure Island, California, deep instrumentation array is currently one of the most heavily-instrumented and best-characterized installations in the United States for measuring the effects of strong motion earthquakes.  It is located in San Francisco Bay, between the San Andreas and the Hayward faults.  In 1990, the aggregate probability of an event of magnitude 7 or greater on or the other of these faults was estimated at 67% over the subsequent 30 years; newer information may cause this estimate to be revised upward.\r\n\r\nThe site was established in 1991-1992 by the National Science Foundation to directly measure the non-linear response of a deep soil profile to strong ground shaking.  The site consists of an 86 meter deep soft soil profile over bedrock.  Similar soil conditions exist under large parts of the San Francisco Bay Area and in other cities with a similar earthquake risk.  The Island is in the process of being transferred by the US Navy to the City of San Francisco, which strongly supports the continued existence of this array.  Instrumentation is maintained by the California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program, which is also committed to publishing the strong-motion data.\r\n\r\nThis action is to establish a committee to oversee the operation of this array and the use of this site for research in earthquake hazard mitigation.  The committee is to be composed of seismologists and geotechnical engineers from academia, government agencies, and private practice.  This committee will review critically the state of the site characterization and instrumentation, define experiments that could be performed at this site, and serve as the primary point of contact for investigators wishing to undertake experiments at this site.\r\n",
