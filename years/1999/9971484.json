The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will support a nine-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. John Hasenbein, University of Texas, Austin to work with researchers from the Center for Mathematical Research (CIMAT), under the direction of Dr. Victor Perez-Abreu, in Guanajuato, Mexico.\r\nThe focus of this research is to study reentrant line models for use in the semiconductor industry.  The production of semiconductor wafers involves hundreds of steps and jobs, which traverse highly reentrant routes through scores of machines.  Reentrant routing is when parts revisit machines multiple times in subsequent steps.  Efficient control of the production process could save industry millions of dollars per year.  Dr. Hasenbein's research will study mathematical tools that will help to analyze and control these production systems.  He will focus on stochastic processing network models.\r\nThe Center for Research in Mathematics has a core staff of 40 mathematical researchers in pure math, probability and statistics.  It also hosts many professional visiting researchers from around Latin America and the world.  CIMAT hosts numerous seminars, conferences and short courses related to Dr. Hasenbein's research.  Not only will he be able to establish enduring collaborations with these researchers from Mexico and other countries, but also his experience will contribute to the elevation of the international stature of the operations research and related mathematical modeling fields.\r\n***\r\n",
