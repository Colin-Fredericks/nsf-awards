 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial computing workloads, such as on-line transaction\r\nprocessing, file-serving, data mining, and web-serving, currently\r\nrepresent about 85 percent of the overall market for large computing\r\nsystems.  Nevertheless, much of the computer architecture research\r\nto date has focused on improving the capability of computer systems\r\nto access, process, and store the large arrays of data common to\r\nnumerically-intensive workloads.  The implicit assumption has been\r\nthat all types of computer systems would benefit from the\r\narchitectural innovations developed for these applications.  To\r\naddress this disparity between the economic importance of commercial\r\ncomputing systems and the traditional architecture development focus\r\non technical computing systems, this project is developing the\r\nFlexible Architectural Cores for Commercial Computing Systems\r\nprocessor architecture.  This new architecture is based on the\r\nobservation that the constantly changing behavior in a commercial\r\ncomputing environment causes different architectural innovations to\r\nbe applicable during different phases of execution.  A unique aspect\r\nof this project that will significantly enhance its relevance to\r\ncommercial computing environments is the close collaboration of the\r\nIBM Corporation's commercial microprocessor development group in\r\nRochester, Minnesota.  This project will make substantial\r\ncontributions to educational and human resource development through\r\ngraduate student research and interaction with industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
