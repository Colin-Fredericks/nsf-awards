 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet is widely considered as the most reachable platform of next-generation information infrastructure.  Although IP/DWDM (internet protocol over dense wavelength division multiplexing) technology has been demonstrated to transport 1 terabit/s bandwidth over a single fiber, the capability of routing IP packets at 1 terabit/s still remains to be seen.  Furthermore, in order to provide different\r\nquality-of-service (QoS) requirements for the Next Generation Internet (NGI), IETF has suggested the Internet Integrated Services (IIS) with resource ReSerVation signaling protocol (RSVP).  Although several\r\nalgorithms have been proposed to guarantee the stringent delay bound for the guarantee service flows, how to implement them at the aggregate rate of terabit/s remains challenging.\r\n\r\nThis proposal tackles the problem by designing a large-capacity switch fabric for a terabit IP router and tightly controlling packet delay at the input and output ports of the router.  The proposed terabit IP\r\nswitch router consists of multiple routing modules (RMs) that are interconnected by a fast switch fabric. Each RM forwards arriving packets independently, thus allowing the router to scale flexibly up to terabit/s.  With the application of the following innovations, supporting the IIS at terabit/s is conceivably achievable.\r\n\r\nFirst, a novel dual round robin (DRR) arbitration scheme is proposed to provide statistically bounded delay at the input ports of a nonblocking input-output buffered crossbar packet switch with a moderate speedup.  The DRR is a distributed switch control scheme, in which input selection and output contention resolution are separatedly handled by two independent sets of round-robin arbiters.  The switch is used to provide high speed interconnection among RM's.  By using bit-slice technique with multiple switch planes, the switch operation speed is reduced and can be implemented with low-cost CMOS technology.\r\n\r\nSecond, a novel token tunneling mechanism is proposed to implement the DRR scheme at terabit/s.  It is shown that with state-of-the-art 0.25-micron CMOS technology, the arbitration time can be as small as\r\n10 ns for a 256x256 Tb/s packet switch. This scheme can also be extended to handle multiple-priority traffic.  To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that implements the DRR scheme will be prototyped.\r\n\r\nFinally, packet fair queuing (PFQ) has been proven capable of providing delay bound guarantee for the IIS.  It will be used at the output ports of the router.  Arrival packets are usually time stamped based on their committed rates.  However, time stamp's computation and sorting always pose a great challenge for high speed networks, especially with hundreds of thousands of flows that need to be supported.  Therefore, a novel RAM-based searching engine (RSE) is proposed to implement the PFQ scheduler at 10 Gb/s for each output\r\nport at low cost by using off-shelf parts while supporting hundreds of thousands of flows.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, due to the heterogeneous networking environment in the Internet, hierarchical packet scheduling is required to accommodate different service classes and multiple Internet Service Providers\r\n(ISP's).  The shaper-scheduler scheme has been proven capable of providing tight delay bound in the hierarchical packet scheduling environment.  Unfortunately, the scheme is very complicated and has not\r\nbeen shown feasible at high speed and at low cost, especially for packet media.  Therefore, a general shaper-scheduler is proposed for both ATM and packet networks.  The concept of the RSE will be extended\r\nto a two-dimensional RSE (2-D RSE) that implements the general shaper-scheduler.  To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, a 2-D RSE will also be prototyped.\r\n\r\nAll the prototypes and the developed technologies will be made transferable to the industry in order to expedite the deployment of the terabit IP routers in the NGI.",
