The objective of their research is to define a methodology for the modeling and analysis of phased-mission systems (PMS).   Their approach to this problem involves the definition of a general modeling methodology, integration of the methodology into a tool for the automated evaluation of system dependability, and application of the methodology to the analysis of several realistic case studies.  \r\n\r\nThe US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in modeling techniques for performance, reliability, and dependability evaluation.  This is complemented by the Italian expertise in a hierarchical and modular approach to the modeling of PMS.  Phased-mission are of strong interest for many industrial groups and represent an active area of research for application in such domains as aided-guide aircraft, nuclear power plant control, or on-board computing systems for long-life spacecraft. \r\n",
