 "awd_abstract_narration": "9905510\r\nMesser\r\nThis project examines what happened to the theme of \"ending hunger\" as a mobilizing idea, value and goal for the late twentieth century.  It explores how the \"ending hunger\" theme became important to  many private voluntary organizations during the 1970s and 1980s, such as the Hunger Project and Food First, and traces how these institutions evolved.  The project also examines a decline in anti-hunger efforts in the late 1990s.  The overall goal is to understand how individual moral values and commitments are translated into successful social movements, and to understand the reasons for a decline in \"ending hunger\" activities, partly as internal structural organizational factors and partly from external world system changes.  \r\nThe questions will be addressed through construction of detailed case histories of four anti-hunger non-governmental organizations, the Hunger Project, the Brown University World Hunger Program, Second Harvest, and Food First, considered against a backdrop of changing world political and economic conditions and the changing agendas of the UN and other government and non-government agencies.  The time frame will cover the twenty five years from the World Food Conference of 1974 to the present.  The resulting analysis will be valuable to planners, public officials, and members of organizations interested in understanding the rise and fall of different sorts of social action agendas.  The case studies will represent valuable knowledge for other studies of changes in societal efforts to ameliorate social problems.\r\n",
