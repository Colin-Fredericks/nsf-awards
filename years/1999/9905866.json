 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although considerable attention has been devoted over recent decades to issues associated with urban poverty and public programs designed to ameliorate poverty, relative little attention has focused on geographic dimensions of urban poverty, the dynamics of immigrant assimilation, and intrametropolitan fiscal disparities.  Building on recent research of urban poverty and welfare, spatial analyses of immigration, and new urban public finance models, this project will investigate the intrametropolitan distribution of uncompensated poverty costs, which are defined as costs for nonredistributive services provided by cities that are not offset by intergovernmental or other transfers in aid of the poor.  In particular, the investigators will consider how those costs vary according to spatial patterns of urban poverty, other characteristics of localities and their resident populations, and their impact on intrametropolitan fiscal disparities.  The researchers will conceptualize, estimate, and test a model of relationships between urban poverty rates and uncompensated poverty costs, conducting a case study of the Los Angeles metropolitan region, which is characterized by local fiscal stress, large volumes of immigration, and high rates of poverty.  For municipalities in this five-county region, the investigators will measure the scope of anti-poverty revenues (in the form of direct payments and tax expenditures) provided to residents and localities, and they will characterize municipalities using a range of other indicators that appear to be associated with uncompensated poverty costs.  These measures include local fiscal capacity, employment base, spatial configuration of poverty, mix of working versus non-working poor, levels of racial and ethnic segregation, demographic features including the share of immigrants by birth and arrival cohort and other key characteristics, strength of voluntary sector services to the poor, and municipal fiscal strategies, institutional features, and land use patterns that may moderate the impacts of poverty.  Multivariate regression models will be used to estimate the extent to which poverty compensation rates varied according to key demographic, fiscal, and institutional features of municipalities over the 1980-1996 period, a time of dramatic shifts in fiscal federalism, welfare state organization, and metropolitan demographic and labor market conditions.  The uncompensated poverty cost model that will be developed through this project will provide a valuable tool for analyzing the geopolitical implications of concentrated urban poverty, focusing attention on intrametropolitan disparities that might deepen regional problems over time.  This study thus will increase understands of the ways in which the nation's success in resolving problems of urban poverty may be connected to broader issues of metropolitan economic growth, social equity, and environmental quality, and indeed national well being.\r\n",
