 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study differs in three important aspects from other studies that document or explain productivity differences at the plant or firm level.  First, firms are supposed to organize their production process in two stages. In the first stage, a firm decides what type of plant to build. This choice will mainly bear on the resulting allocative efficiency. In the second stage, a firm actually operates the plant conditional on the type built before. Performance in this stage can be interpreted as technical efficiency. The estimation procedure reflects these consecutive choices.\r\n\r\nSecond, a more accurate measure of productivity is obtained by supplementing the usual data on inputs and outputs with industry detail. Knowledge of the production process is used not to derive conclusions directly but to specify a more sophisticated model of production. Focus is on variables the actual decisions are made over.\r\n\r\nFinally, productivity is not separated from the structure of production. In contrast previous studies have specified an input aggregator function for capital, labor and intermediate inputs, and added a multiplicative Hicks-neutral productivity term. Here technical efficiency is conditional on the type of plant chosen. That choice can be evaluated too and is interpreted as allocative efficiency.\r\n",
