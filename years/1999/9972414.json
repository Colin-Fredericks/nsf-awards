 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to create a robotics laboratory to support undergraduate teaching and learning in artificial intelligence and to provide undergraduates with experience with autonomous agents in a real-world environment. The lab will be used in junior and senior level courses on artificial intelligence, as a one- to three-week module for introductory computer science courses, and to support student capstone or honors projects in Al.\r\n\r\nAutonomous agents, computer systems that take action in the world without human intervention, are increasingly important in computer science. Current developments include software agents to search the Internet, filter news articles, or schedule meetings, and robot agents to explore Mars, navigate factory floors, or explore the ocean. Undergraduate students must learn about the issues involved in creating autonomous systems, such as planning, managing uncertainty, and interacting with other agents. Robots are an intuitive platform for this purpose. While robot tasks (e.g., \"avoid obstacles\") appear simple to students, autonomous agent issues arise naturally and immediately: the real world is complex and confusing.\r\n\r\nThe artificial intelligence courses will be primary focuses of this project. In these courses, students will study issues of autonomous agents through hands-on work with robots. Other aspects of Al will be framed around agent issues: planning, vision, knowledge representation, and scalability of algorithms. Students performing advanced individual work - independent research, honors projects, or capstone projects - will also have access to robots for studying advanced Al issues. Students in introductory courses will use the robots as an exciting test bed for studying program design. Further in the future, we anticipate extending its use to interdisciplinary seminars on cognitive science, and perhaps outreach to area youth. This project will foster an environment of experimentation and excitement about artificial intelligence and autonomous agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
