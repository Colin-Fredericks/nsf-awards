 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875256\r\nGenzer\r\nHybrids comprising dispersions of nanoparticles in insulating matrices represent a novel class of materials.  Unusual optical, electrical and magnetic properties are expected in nanocomposites with controlled spatial distribution of the embedded nanoparticles.  These can be utilized in the fabrication of future generation devices, such as high-density magnetic storage materials, molecular semiconductors, or optical coatings transparent to some wavelengths but opaque to others.  This CAREER award will investigate the formation, organization, and physical properties of nanocomposites made of periodically modulated arrays of nanoparticles embedded in self-organized two-component polymer matrices deposited onto solid substrates.  The organization and spatial distribution of the nanoparticles will be adjusted by tailoring the structural properties of the host polymer material.  In particular, by using mixtures of diblock copolymers (or mixtures of diblock copolymers and homopolymers) or by using laterally phase-separated polymer blends, the dimensions of the structural features in the polymer matrix, and thus the distribution of the embedded nanoparticles, will range from several nanometers to several micrometers,  respectively.  A fine control over the morphology of the nanocomposite will be achieved by suitably adjusting the molecular parameters of the polymers (molecular weight, processing temperature, copolymer architecture, and mixture composition) and tuning the interactions at the matrix/substrate and matrix/particle interfaces.  Initial research efforts will focus on studying the formation and morphology of the mesoscopic structures, investigating the interplay between the polymer/particle interactions, and probing the ordering mechanisms as a function of the host-and guest- properties.  Subsequent work will be devoted to determining the optical, electrical, magnetic, and transport properties of the newly generated structures.\r\n%%%\r\nThe research program will be complemented by a comprehensive teaching curriculum.  Both undergraduate and graduate education in the areas of polymeric materials and self-assembly will be advanced by:  teaching a course about experimental methods in interfacial polymer science (with the emphasis on capabilities and application of experimental techniques); developing a new course on self-assembly in materials; emphasizing cooperative learning; and applying a number of different tutoring styles in the classroom and the laboratory.  These educational efforts will offer students an opportunity to broaden their education scope, learn to work in teams, and master experimental and communication skills.  The overall goal is to prepare the students for employment or for future graduate studies in engineering.\r\n***        \r\n",
