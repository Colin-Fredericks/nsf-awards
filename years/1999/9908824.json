It is expected that discussions among the participants will help to establish new collaborations between scientists in the countries of the Americas, stimulating training, cooperation and new research initiatives for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe proposed course of lectures, seminars and discussions builds on strengths of the atomic, molecular, quantum optical and, to some extent, chemical communities centered around the use of large research tools already doing research in Latin America.  In particular, emphasis will be given to cooperation and collaboration between the synchrotron light sources in Campinas (Brazil) and Berkeley (California).  The Institute will help spread awareness of particular strengths and facilities throughout the hemisphere, so that mutually beneficial collaborations can be initiated.\r\n\r\nThe institute will feature four areas of atomic, molecular and optical physics, areas that are interrelated in content, and, in some cases, technique as well.  The four areas will involve studies using synchrotron radiation, lasers,  electron and ion beams, and efforts based on quantum optical effects, in particular quantum computing with ion traps.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
