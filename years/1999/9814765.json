This project enables science centers and community-based organizations to use their expertise to conduct outreach for students and their parents using activities developed.  The activities will consist of a variety of design projects that will challenge children to build working models of technological devices.  The materials involved in the activities are common everyday items that are usually found around the home.  The project will be scaled up each of the three years to reach six science centers and 25-30 after school programs in major areas of the eastern part of the United States.  The PI will produce a manual for collaboration and a design technology guide for publication and national dissemination.\r\n\r\nThe cost sharing for this project is 33% of the total project budget.\r\n",
