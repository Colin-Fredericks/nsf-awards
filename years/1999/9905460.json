 "awd_abstract_narration": "The important role played in the world economy by GATT (and now it successor, the WTO) is widely accepted. Since its creation in 1947, GATT has grown in membership from an initial set of 23 countries to a roster that now exceeds 100 countries. The expanding GATT membership reflects the success that this organization has had in facilitating tariff reductions. Through the 8 rounds of trade-policy negotiations that have been sponsored by GATT, the average ad valorem tariff on industrial goods has fallen from over 40% to below 4%. In light of the significant impact that GATT has had on the world economy, an important question for economists is whether a theoretical interpretation of GATT and its main features can be provided.\r\n\r\n          While the past success of GATT justifies in its own right a theoretical investigation of its main features, this task is perhaps even more important when the future of this multilateral institution is considered. A critical question in the coming years is whether the same set of principles on which postwar multilateral liberalization has been based can or should be applied to a host of \"new\" trade policy issues. These issues include the spread of preferential trading agreements, the harmonization of competition policies, and the protection of the environment, intellectual property and human rights. An understanding of why GATT's principles have worked well in the more traditional arena of multilateral tariff liberalization for industrial goods can lay the foundation for answers to this critical question.\r\n\r\n          The purpose of our proposed research is to develop a theoretical understanding of GATT's essential principles, and to use this understanding to investigate the nature of GATT's success in traditional areas, to examine the potential for extending the essential design features of GATT to new areas, and to begin an exploration of the distinctive features of international financial institutions such as the IMF in light of what is learned about GATT. We propose to accomplish this by building on a general framework for investigating the nature of trade agreements that we have already developed. A first goal of our proposed research is to show how GATT's central pillars of reciprocity and non-discrimination may be interpreted and understood within this framework. A second goal of our proposed research is to consider several dimensions associated with the issue of enforcement of GATT commitments. A third goal of our proposed research is to extend our framework to examine \"new\" issues that GATT now confronts such as labor and environmental standards. And a fourth and final goal of our proposed research is to move beyond the study of trade rules and institutions to investigate the economics of international financial institutions.\r\n",
