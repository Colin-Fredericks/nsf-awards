 "awd_abstract_narration": "9816734\r\nMcGrath\r\nThe short-term objective of the research is to demonstrate that a recently developed class of fluorescent molecular probes can be used as in situ tissue viability probes.  Specifically, green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescent probes developed by molecular biologists will be used in conjunction with an animal skin flap window chamber to allow continuous, dynamic, three-dimensional, in vivo tissue/tumor observations and measurements of fluorescence related to cellular viability.  It is expected that the successful demonstration of the feasibility of this approach would allow for exciting and novel subsequent research that would provide an unprecedented level of detail regarding freeze/thaw damage at the cellular and tissue level.  It is anticipated that the method will be especially productive when applied to issues related to vasculature injury, which are precisely the issues which state-of-the art research defines as one of the most important to address at this time.  Successful completion of this exploratory research is also expected to lead to an improved understanding of the another major shortcoming in our current knowledge: the mechanisms of freeze/thaw injury at \"slow\" freezing rates for isolated cells as well as for tissues in vitro and in vivo.  Finally, future developments of the method using GFPs and transfected immunologically-significant cells could lead to an improved understanding of certain aspects of cell-mediated cryoimmune responses, another important issue in cryosurgery and tissue freezing in general.\r\n\r\nThe long term goal of the research is aimed at developing cryosurgical devices and procedures which would make cryosurgery a cost effective, minimally invasive method for selectively killing tumors while avoiding injury to surrounding normal tissues and to do so for as many cancers as possible.  The current state of the art limits the optimization of existing cryosurgical devices and processes as well as the development of new devices and procedures that could extend the use of cryosurgery to other applications.  The limiting factor is that the mechanisms by which the freezing and thawing kill the cancerous tissue is not understood well enough.  Part of the reason that these mechanisms remain unknown is related to the relatively crude means currently used for assessing viability in tissues in vivo. \r\n\r\nThis research grant will support a woman mechanical engineering graduate student who is conducting research on this topic for her Ph.D. thesis.  She intends to pursue an academic career in the field of biomedical engineering.  The research has already attracted two female undergraduate engineering students who are beginning to get involved with it and who have expressed interest to pursue graduate study as a part of the research group as a result.\r\n\r\n",
