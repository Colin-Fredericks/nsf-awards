 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Bruce Routledge, MS Leigh-Ann Bedal will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Her work focuses on the archaeological site of Petra which is located in Jordan, ca 80 kilometers South of the Dead Sea. Documentary evidence indicates that Petra was capitol of the Nabataean kingdom  and its impressive rock hewn buildings and monumental tomb facades carved into sandstone cliffs are well known. However much less is understod about the site's function or the reason for its location in a barren desert region. Based on excvavations in the early part of this century, it was hypothesized that large open spaces served as markets and that the site played an important role in long distance trade. As Ms Bedal notes however, it is extremely uncertain what functions these areas in fact were and the goal of this research is to address this issue. Over the course of one field season MS Bedal will conduct a survey of the \"Lower Market\" area. She will construct a careful map of all standing architectural features and collect surface materials. She will then conduct test excavations in selected areas. \r\n\r\nThe project will shed new light on an important prehistoric site. In this period which preceeded Roman conquest, much of the Near East was organized into empires and archaeologists wish to understand the functions which such units served and the forces which facilitated the integration of diverse ethnic and linguistic groups spread over exgtensive geographic areas into large-scale functioning political units. Many researchers believe that organization of and control over long distance trade permitted the necessary centralization of power and the Nabataean kingdom provides a venue to evaluate this hypothesis. The research will produce data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
