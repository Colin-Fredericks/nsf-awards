 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation MRI) award will support the acquisition of an ultrafast (Femtosecond) laser processing and diagnostic system for research, research training and education in the area of materials processing and diagnostics.  This equipment will enable research and education in the areas of:  (1) ultrafast laser micromachining of metals, alloys, ceramics, polymers, composites and electronic materials; (2) ultrafast laser deposition of thin films of various materials; and (3) development of ultrafast imaging and diagnostics techniques and their applications.  The equipment facility will be a shared resource for various faculty members and graduate students located in various engineering and science departments and the newly formed Applied Research Center of the Old Dominion University.  This will develop new interactions between faculty members who are experts in various materials and processing technology with the faculty whose expertise is more towards optics and lasers as well as new industrial interactions.\r\n    Laser processing of materials is considered a manufacturing technology for the 21st century, and part of the worldwide effort to enhance and expand the current \"state of the art\".  Current laser processing occurs by thermal processes and is not very energy efficient.  Ultrafast laser technology provides a non-thermal method for materials processing such as micromachining and coating of films of various types of materials.  The research thrusts based on the supported ultrafast laser facility will have significant impact on the current advancement of the knowledge on laser matter interaction, imaging, spectroscopy and on various manufacturing technologies.\r\n\r\n",
