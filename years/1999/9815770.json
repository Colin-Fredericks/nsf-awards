The objective of the collaboration is to study the interaction of single topoisomerases with DNA.  Topoisomerases are ubiquitous and essential enzymes that solve the topological problems that accompany DNA replication, transcription, Chromatin assembly, recombination and chromosome segregation by introducing transient breaks into the DNA.  The investigators will study the mechanics and dynamics of both types of topoisomerases and DNA replication intermediates.  They will use the technique of single DNA manipulations to study these interactions.\r\n\r\nThe US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in topoisomerases and the topological properties of DNA.  This will be advanced by the French investigators' expertise in DNA manipulation and their apparatus, which allows for twisting, stretching and mechanical measurements on single DNA molecules in a controlled environment.  Proteins, ionic buffers, and temperature can be changed at will using this apparatus.  The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of the dynamics and mechanics of these topical enzymes.\r\n",
