Pierce  \r\nUniversity of South Carolina, Columbia  \r\nTitle:  \"Acquisition of an Automated Triaxial Testing System for Education and Research\"   \r\n\r\nThis equipment grant provides funds for the acquisition of an automated triaxial testing system for the geotechnical laboratory in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of South Carolina. The desired system is capable of performing tests of controlled rate of stress or strain loading and different types of prescribed stress paths under both drained and undrained conditions.  The primary objective for obtaining this specialized laboratory equipment is to improve the quality and broaden the scope of geotechnical engineering research and educational activities at the University of South Carolina.  In particular, this triaxial system will be used to facilitate advanced research by two junior faculty members, and enhance the undergraduate and graduate curriculum by its direct use in several courses.  This triaxial system will directly impact the future direction and support of a currently funded research project in controlled low strength materials and several on-going studies in a geotechnical testing pit maintained in the department.  The ability to perform advanced triaxial tests will make the faculty competitive to obtain other research projects, such as proposed projects on liquefaction susceptibility of South Carolina soils and stress-strain response of backfill for field instrumentation.  This system will also provide laboratory experience for undergraduate students in Soil Mechanics and graduate students in a new course in Advanced Field and Laboratory Instrumentation for Geotechnics proposed by the junior faculty.  Triaxial testing allows students to learn the effects of consolidation, confining stress levels, and drainage conditions on shear strength, and as such will enhance their understanding of soil mechanics.  Research and education will be integrated by providing demonstrations of on-going research projects to both undergraduate and graduate students.",
