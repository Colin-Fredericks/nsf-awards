 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe objective of this research is to increase understanding of the genesis of tropical cyclones.  Of particular interest are the influences on genesis of phenomena whose scales are larger than the tropical cyclone and, therefore, more likely to be measured accurately.  There is considerable disagreement in the community regarding the relative importance of the large-scale phenomena and the specific ways in which they affect the process.\r\n\tThis project consists of three related tasks.  One is a continuation of observational studies, using gridded analyses, of the pre-cursors to cyclogenesis in the eastern Pacific, particularly the relative roles of the background state, mountain interactions, upstream atmospheric waves, and wind surges.  The PI also will investigate the role of the monsoon trough in this region.  The other two tasks deal with the phenomenon of easterly waves.  A global climatology of sign reversals in the meridional gradient of potential vorticity and its influence on easterly waves and cyclogenesis will be completed.  In addition, numerical simulations of easterly waves will be conducted, beginning with a simple shallow water model and moving to the more complex MM5 model.\r\n\tImproved understanding of the processes involved in tropical cyclogenesis is a key step in improving the forecasting of tropical cyclones. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
