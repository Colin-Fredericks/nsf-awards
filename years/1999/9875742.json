Hsieh\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project reexamines how compiler optimization affects one of the\r\nbottlenecks in commercial applications: the cost of fetching\r\ninstructions.  Standard compiler optimizations trade instruction\r\nbandwidth for faster instruction sequences, which works well for\r\napplications that have good instruction locality.  Unfortunately,\r\nrecent studies have shown that instruction bandwidth is a\r\nperformance-limiting factor in many commercial applications, such as\r\ndatabases, circuit simulators, and multimedia programs.  In addition,\r\ntechnology trends in processor architectures will also increase\r\napplications' demands for instruction bandwidth.  The proposed\r\nresearch will explore several solutions to these problems.  First, two\r\nnew compiler optimizations to improve utilization of the instruction\r\ncache, instruction cache scheduling and code factoring, will be\r\ninvestigated.  Trace analysis of commercial applications will be used\r\nto quantify their benefits.  Second, traditional compiler\r\noptimizations will be reexamined and redesigned as necessary, with the\r\ngoal of making them sensitive to instruction cache utilization.\r\nFinally, architectural changes to support explicit cooperation between\r\nthe compiler and processor to make more efficient use of the\r\ninstruction cache will be explored.  This research will provide a\r\nbetter understanding of how compilers should optimize large,\r\ncommercial applications, which is a field that has remained relatively\r\nunexamined in the research community.\r\n\r\n",
