The core was shipped to the University of New Hampshire.  Subsequent major ion analyses of snowpit samples and a short (3.5 meter) section of the core from a depth of 112.5-116 meters indicates that a well preserved glaciochemical record is available from Eclipse Dome ice core.  The Principal Investigator will develop a multi-parameter, high resolution paleoclimate record for the past 200 years through the chemical (major ions and oxygen isotopes) analysis of the Eclipse ice core.  He will also collect and analyze available gridded meteorological data and instrumental meteorological records from stations surrounding the St. Elias Mountains.  This observational data will be used to calibrate the ice core record and a variety of meteorological variables.\r\n\r\nPreliminary analyses indicates that the Eclipse Dome record should provide a record that is complimentary to the 290 year ice core record recovered from 5,430 meters on Mt. Logan.  The continuous, high resolution, multi-parameter ice core that the Principal Investigator will use should provide data to investigate temporal variations in the physical climate system, air chemistry, and biogeochemical cycling.  The Eclipse Dome record should be a valuable contribution for a data-poor region to the  growing network of multi-parameter, annually resolved ice core and tree-ring records from the Arctic  that can be used to document the regional characteristics of global climate change events.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
