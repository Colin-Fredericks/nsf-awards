 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Engineering Microsystems: \"XYZ\" on a Chip project is to address issues that are essential to the development of a power system suitable for remote, autonomous microsystems.  A critical element of any micropower supply is the ability to store energy and deliver it at the appropriate time and in the require form. In recent years, microfabrication techniques have been extended to a broader range of devices that offer a whole new level of functionality. These new devices are capable of interacting with the physical world, and an important class of these includes the remote, autonomous devices intended to operate without physical (hardwire) connections for either communication or power.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work builds upon the previous experience of the investigators with microsystems to address fundamental issues to develop, demonstrate and evaluate a method for integration of a microbattery with electronic components on a single chip. This will be accomplished by the design and fabrication of a simple circuit, including the batteries and appropriate electrical connections, in a sequential integration. A new fabrication process will be developed for microbattery fabrication directly in the silicon substrate.  In addition, the objective is to develop MEMS switches as an enabling technology for microbattery arrays to provide a flexible power system suitable for remote, autonomous microsystems.  Switch actuation suitable for use with microbatteries will be developed and demonstrated, and these MEMS switches will be connected to a microbattery array to demonstrate the performance of the system.\r\n",
