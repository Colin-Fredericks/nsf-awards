 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tRecent experience with the SO2 trading program, ongoing discussions of possible carbon trading programs, and other policy reforms and proposals (e.g., regional NOx trading) suggest that incentive-based environmental regulation will likely play an increasingly important role in the United States.  The desirability of these options lies in the possible reduction in the cost of abating pollution, with the single most important factor affecting the relative cost of economic incentive-based versus other approaches likely to be the degree of heterogeneity among pollution sources in their marginal costs of pollution abatement.  Yet, there have been insufficient attempts to use existing data to rigorously measure cost heterogeneity and hence the potential gains from such programs over the status quo or alternative performance standards.\r\n\r\n\tThe investigators will develop econometrically estimable, structural models of plant-level pollution abatement costs that explicitly allow for significant heterogeneity. After estimating these models using Census data, they will first assess the degree and sources of cost heterogeneity, and then use simulations to measure the potential gains from using economic incentives relative to other regulatory approaches. This research both develops methods for measuring the gains associated with incentive-based regulation and applies the methods to historical data in the manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n\tThe researchers' development and application of a methodology for estimating cost heterogeneity and measuring the potential gains from incentive-based regulation will result in important tools for policymakers who must decide when and where such policies are most important to apply and how they should be designed. Since the implementation of these incentive-based programs can involve both administrative and political costs, the results of this research will provide valuable guidance for deciding which directions for policy reform offer the greatest opportunity to improve regulatory cost-effectiveness.\r\n",
