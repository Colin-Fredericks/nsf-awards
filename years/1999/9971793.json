 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will support research on mathematical problems in fluid mechanics \r\nand related partial differential equations and their applications, along \r\nwith the analysis and development of efficient numerical methods. The objective \r\nof this research program is threefold: investigate important nonlinear problems \r\nincluding compressible fluids with various constitutive relations, asymptotic \r\nproblems, multiphase problems, transonic flows, and develop stable and efficient \r\nnumerical algorithms; study dissipation mechanisms for nonlinear partial \r\ndifferential equations, especially for compressible viscous gas flow; \r\nand analyze and develop new theoretical techniques for the study of these problems.\r\n\r\nProblems in fluid dynamics arise in many areas of science and engineering,\r\nfor example in gas dynamics, hydraulics, elasticity, plasticity, combustion, \r\nmagnetohydrodynamics, multiphase flow, phase transition, charge transport \r\nin semiconductors, biological transport of ions, and etching and deposition \r\nprocesses.  The physical processes are typically governed by certain nonlinear \r\nsystems of partial differential equations.  The award will support research on\r\nthe solvability of these nonlinear systems and the qualitative behavior of \r\ntheir solutions, as well as on the analysis and development of efficient \r\ntheoretical and numerical methods. This will lead to a better understanding of\r\nthese flow phenomena and their governing laws.\r\n",
