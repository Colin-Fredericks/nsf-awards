Intelligent structural health monitoring has the potential to significantly reduce life-cycle costs, assist in early damage assessment and increase the longevity of the built environment. However, while progress has been made in this area in recent years, it is still not a practical reality. The research will address new ideas in this field in an effort to eliminate the obstacles that remain. Key concepts of the research are (1) a novel method for damage assessment based on strain energy distribution due to dead load, (2) wireless internet-based communications, and (3) system integration. A method is proposed for detecting gradual deterioration in a structure, or damage induced by rare high intensity events, based on the distribution of strain energy due to dead load in the structure. The approach lends itself well to graphical visualization of damage in a building frame and circumvents many of the problems associated with damage detection methods that are based on dynamic modal information. The monitoring system will make use of wireless telecommunications technologies for internet access that exist now, or will exist within the next five years: this includes wireless LANs and low-earth orbit satellite-based internet. Pilot tests of the structural monitoring system will be conducted using remote shake table tests and full-scale structures. The education component includes \"Engineer It,\" a challenging but fun summer enrichment program for eighth through tenth graders that will expose them to the various engineering disciplines and encourage them to pursue academic courses that lead to careers in engineering and science. The program will be managed by the PI and a multi-disciplinary team of engineering undergraduates and will be widely accessible through a World Wide Web site. Finally, the PI's undergraduate Dynamics course will be converted entirely to a Problem-Based learning format, a creative new approach to teaching that is thought to be ideally suited to engineering study and is designed to engage students in the learning process.",
