 "awd_abstract_narration": "The MEF2 gene family comprises of evolutionarily-conserved MADS box-containing transcription factors that are key regulators of muscle differentiation.  Genetic analysis of the Drosophila mef2 gene has established that mef2 function is essential for terminal differentiation of body wall muscles, gut and heart musculatures in the Drosophila embryo.  The pivotal role of mef2 in myogenesis is consistent with its stringently-regulated expression during embryogenesis.  Promoter/enhancer analysis has indicated that mef2 expression is controlled by an array of cisacting regulatory elements that are modulated by inductive and mesoderm-specific genetic cues.  Initial mef2 expression in the developing mesoderm is activated by Twist while subsequent maintenance of mef2 expression in the dorsal mesoderm is mediated through dpp/BMP signaling.  At later stages, mef2 expression in muscle progenitors and mature musculatures is controlled by separable enhancer elements, which are subject to differential, yet unknown genetic inputs.\r\n\r\n     The goal of the proposed research is to analyze upstream regulators that control mef2 expression in somatic (skeletal) myoblasts.  Transgenic approaches will be pursued to characterize in detail an enhancer element that mediates regulated mef2 expression in pre-fusion myoblasts.  Efforts will also be devoted towards characterizing a new Drosophila mutation that causes a dramatic reduction of mef2 expression specifically in skeletal muscle but not in visceral and cardiac muscle lineages.  Preliminary studies suggest that this mutation disrupts a gene encoding an important regulator of skeletal muscle development, which mediates its function partly through mef2 activation via the myoblast enhancer under study.  A combination of molecular and genetic approaches will be employed to clone the gene disrupted in the new mutation and to characterize the mode of action of the encoded gene product during myogenesis.  It is anticipated that some of the conclusions derived from these proposed studies will also provide new insights into the regulatory processes operating during early muscle development in vertebrates.\r\n",
