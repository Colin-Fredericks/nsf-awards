 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction of various atmospheric trace gas species with soot will be examined under conditions relevant for the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.  Soot particles, such as those released by aircraft engines, possibly catalyze certain reactions of atmospheric significance, such as the oxidation of sulfur dioxide.  In this study, the uptake of sulfur trioxide, kerosene, ammonia, hydrochloric acid, methyl bromide, and several gaseous hydrocarbons on soot will be studied as a function of temperature (120 to 250K) and as a function of gas partial pressure.  Using a multi-component Langmuir isotherm model, the binding constant as a function of temperature will be obtained, and from that, the heat of adsorption.  Soots of different origins and thus chemical composition will be used.  The effect of sulfuric acid on the interaction of the soot surface with sulfur dioxide will be investigated.  The experiments will be carried out in a vacuum chamber equipped with a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, which provides information on the identity of the adsorbed species as well as quantitative coverages.  A mass spectrometer will be used to monitor gas phase concentrations including products of chemical reactions, if they occur.  This project is supported under the RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) Program.",
