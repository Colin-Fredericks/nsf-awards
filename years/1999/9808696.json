 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to better understand the relationship between economic growth, democracy, and environmental quality. This is now a prominent policy question. Decision makers in domestic and international agencies need to know how political reform and accelerating growth in some of the world's poorest nations will affect the global environment. Theoretical models show that the relationship between growth in income and pollution could be positive or negative. Increasing production causes more pollution to be generated, but higher income can intensify demands for environmental protection. Empirical research on this subject indicates that several forms of pollution seem to decline with economic growth once a country's income reaches a certain level.  Research on this topic has largely ignored the fact that pollution control is a public good, provided by government. One consequence of this is that results from prior research on the growth environmental quality relationship may be flawed because they confound the environmental effects of economic growth with the effects of political reform. That is, some of the environmental effects attributed to growth may actually be due to cross country variations in political institutions. A second consequence is that the profession is uninformed about the environmental effects of political change, and thus can offer no credible insights on the environmental implications of the recent trend toward democratization or on kinds of political reforms that are likely to foster environmental protection. These are serious shortcomings in light the fact that political institutions in some of the world's poorest nations have changed profoundly during the last decade and some are now growing vigorously.  This project will develop a theoretical model of public goods provision under non-democratic government, and estimate it empirically. The public good of primary concern here is environmental protection. Preliminary inquiry, and the received literature on public choice, gives some indication that non democratic regimes are likely to under provide public goods relative to democracies because they fail to represent the interests of some segments of the population, and accordingly ignore benefits accruing to these non represented groups in making policy. This will serve as the starting point for a thorough theoretical investigation of public goods provision in non-democratic government. The resulting model will then be incorporated in a general equilibrium framework that (i) relates a country's environmental policy to its income and form of government, (ii) relates pollution levels to environmental policy, economy wide output, and the composition of output, and (iii) relates the composition of output to income and environmental policy.  The main objective is to estimate all components of this model empirically. The form of government in a given country and year will be characterized with information on its method of selecting the chief executive (elective vs. non elective,) the type of chief executive (president, premier, monarch, military ruler, etc.), the degree of party competition, the effectiveness of the legislature (effective, ineffective, non existent,) and similar variables. Levels of environmental pollution will be represented with data from monitoring sites in a wide range of countries and years on levels of sulfur dioxide, smoke, and heavy particulates. Cross country differences in levels of several of water pollutants and provision of such environmentally related public goods as access to sanitation facilities, safe drinking water, and public health will be examined in the same fashion. The analysis of output composition will be structured to incorporate those industries most responsible for generating specific pollutants. For example, the primary man made SO2sources are fossil fuel combustion (for electricity production, home heating, and transportation,) metal refining, and certain industrial processes, so these industries must be represented individually.  With empirical estimates of the relevant relationships, it will be possible to more accurately assess the separate effects of political reform and economic growth on the environment.",
