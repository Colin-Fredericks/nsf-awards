 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terry\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on genetically engineering plants to study the mechanisms for selenium (Se) hyperaccumulation, tolerance and volatilization with a long-term goal of developing plants suitable for the phytoremediation of Se. The objective of the study is to develop Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) plants with enhanced capacities to extract Se from soil and volatilize Se to the atmosphere as dimethylselenide, a relatively non-toxic form of Se, by genetically engineering these plants to express novel genes from a Se-accumulating species, Astragalus bisulcatus. This species, which is specially adapted to seleniferous soils, accumulates as much as 4000 mg Se per kg dry weight, is very tolerant of high concentrations of Se, and is an excellent volatilizer of Se. A. bisulcatus is unsuitable for phytoremediation because it grows very slowly; Indian mustard on the other hand, is an excellent candidate for phytoremediation because of its fast generation time, high biomass and relatively high tolerance to Se. Objective 1 is to clone the sulfate/selenate transporter from A. bisulcatus, which will then be transformed into Indian mustard. This is an especially valuable objective because the sulfate/selenate transporter from A. bisulcatus has unique properties; it has a very high and selective affinity for selenate, which is absorbed with far greater efficiency than by corresponding transporters from other plant species. To clone the gene for this transporter, a root cDNA library from A. bisulcatus will be made and screened with the available sulfate/selenate transporter gene from Stylosanthes hamata. Objective 2 is to transform Indian mustard with the gene for the enzyme selenocysteine methyltransferase, which has recently been cloned from A. bisulcatus. This enzyme is important because it detoxifies Se and allows the accumulation of high levels of Se in plant tissues. Objective 3 is to determine the extent to which overexpression of the selenocysteine methyl transferase gene in Indian mustard diverts the metabolic flow of Se to the alternate, rapidly volatilizing pathway found in A. bisulcatus (leading to the production of dimethyldiselenide). Objective 4 is to produce transgenic plants over-expressing combinations of these two genes as well as the ATP sulfurylase gene, which have been shown to increase Se accumulation, tolerance and volatilization. \r\nBecause of its potential toxicity, selenium (Se) releases into the environment from electric utilities, oil refineries and from agriculture throughout the western United States, is a very big problem. Phytoremediation is an inexpensive and environment-friendly approach for the cleanup of Se from contaminated sites is. The application of biotechnology to phytoremediation is a novel and exciting area of research. The expression of one or more of the genes from A. bisulcatus has great potential in enhancing Se accumulation and volatilization by plants and will greatly increase the efficiency with which phytoremediation can be used to treat Se-contaminated agricultural soils and water that are often rich in sulfate. In addition, the transgenic plants could be used to study the factors affecting Se uptake, tolerance and the mechanism of Se sequestration and fate within the plants. \r\n\r\n",
