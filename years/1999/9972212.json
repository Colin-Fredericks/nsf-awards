 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapidly growing disparity between processor and I/O performance must be addressed.  Two intriguing trends in storage systems are the appearance of new technologies that suffer from asymmetric read-write performance, and the widening gap between data transfer rate and access time.  A current example is a tertiary storage system with an automated library mechanism.  Such a system exemplifies the wide performance gap between data transfer rate and access time due to mechanical media handling.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this work is to address these issues through the development of techniques for high-performance integration of automated tertiary storage libraries.  These issues include:\r\n\r\n1. Addressing the issue of read-write performance asymmetry, though the use of a log-structured, write-buffered architecture.\r\n\r\n2. The minimization of mechanical access delays, by pre-grouping related data on the same media volume, as it is migrated from local storage.\r\n\r\nThis research will be of direct benefit to today's growing storage needs by allowing high-performance access to vast storage.  It addresses the important issue of latency reduction in cases where data rate far exceeds access speeds.  It also enables the efficient general-purpose adoption of emerging storage technologies, such as magneto-optical and volume holographic, by alleviating problems of read-write performance asymmetry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
