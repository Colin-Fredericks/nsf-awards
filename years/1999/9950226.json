 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) is an indispensable analytical tool used widely in scientific research. Teaching this technique provides essential exposure to two central elements of chemical analysis: separation of mixtures and component identification through molecular weight determination and fragmentation analysis. This project uses a Hewlett-Packard 6890 bench top GC-MS system to enhance our curriculum at all levels, by implementing experiments demonstrating the power of GC-MS applications to general, organic, enzymological, environmental, and forensic chemistry.  Experiments from the educational and research literature, as well as standard EPA methods, are being adapted to meet the needs of our undergraduates, including both science majors and nonmajors.  Central to our curriculum revision are experiments that highlight now standard analytical techniques, such as positive ion chemical ionization analysis, negative ion chemical ionization analysis for trace level electrophilic analytes, and compound identification/structural hypothesis testing through spectrum library searches. Our major objective is to expand the quality of our existing laboratory program, and of our research experiences for undergraduate students, in order to enhance the overall level of preparation of our chemistry students, and to contribute towards faculty development in the areas of both teaching and research. We are sharing the curricular developments from this project with others through lab manual exchanges, faculty interactions, publications in refereed journals, scientific meeting presentations, and through our Department's WebPages. Our active membership in the New England Consortium for Undergraduate Science Education also provides an effective mechanism for dissemination of innovations to our sister institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
