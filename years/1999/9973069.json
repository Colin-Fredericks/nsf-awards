 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will study the relationship between excellent local rings and their completions.  It has long been known that the formal fibers of a ring encode important information about the ring.  Because of this, understanding the formal fiber over the zero ideal (called the generic formal fiber) of a local integral domain is critical.  The PI will work to explore the relationship between a ring and its generic formal fiber.  She will study the relationship between a ring R and R[X] (where X is an indeterminate) by examining the generic formal fiber\r\nof R and R[X].  She will work on the problem of characterizing when a ring satisfies the complete homomorphic images property, and will also study a question relating to the localization problem for tight closure.  In addition, she will explore several rigidity questions.\r\n\r\nThe project will take place at Michigan State University during the 1999-2000 academic year.  The PI will spend the year collaborating with Christel Rotthaus, one of the world's leading experts in excellent rings.  The PI will attend commutative algebra seminars and discuss overlapping research interests with the resident algebraists and visiting algebraists at Michigan State.  This will aid the PI in broadening her research  focus and learning new research skills.  In addition, the PI will brainstorm with these algebraists to discover new problems in the field that will be suitable for her undergraduate students to study.  The ideas coming from\r\nthis collaboration will fuel undergraduate research projects for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe PI for this project is currently in her third year as an Assistant Professor at Williams College.  She has previously advised the research of four undergraduate students and is currently advising the research of another.  She is dedicated to contributing to the advancement of undergraduate research in mathematics by continuing along and broadening her own research path and advising the original research of undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThe PI will devote a major portion of this project to broadening the focus of her research and the focus of the problems on which her undergraduate students can work.  A one-time input of funds at this critical stage will serve to greatly advance her career as a mathematician at a highly selective liberal arts college.\r\n\r\n",
