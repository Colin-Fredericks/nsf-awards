 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Mesolore\" is a multimedia educational project currently under development at the Center for Latin American Studies at Brown University.  Mesolore uses the pictorial and hieroglyphic writing systems of two pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures, Mixtec and Maya, to shed new light on the study of human communication. It will operate on both DOS Windows and Apple OS machines and appear in Spanish and English.\r\n\r\nAs a teaching tool, Mesolore aims to introduce undergraduates to the development and purposes of Mesoamerican writing and culture. As a research tool, Mesolore aims to contribute to Mesoamerican scholarship by providing senior scholars with a readily accessible laboratory of primary and secondary materials.\r\n\r\nMesolore's educational objectives center on the following questions:  What can be learned about human communication by studying Mesoamerican writing systems? What can be learned about people, history, and culture?  Can these writing systems reveal to us information on health, nutrition, social organization, gender diversification and other social factors?  How--and in what social and spatial contexts--was Mesoamerican writing used?  How effective is writing that makes prominent use of \"'pictures\"?  Should we continue to categorize pictorial writing exclusively in evolutionary terms as preceding ideographic, syllabic and alphabetic systems?  \r\n\r\nMesolore Beta '98 is available on CD-ROM.  The CD-ROM materials are themselves quite extensive, and include lectures, debates and discussions, tutorials, laboratories, guest speakers and published articles.  These are interconnected in a multimedia database, which has been developed to the point where it is relatively easy to use and of high quality.  The CD-ROM contains 4 laboratories that are analogues of being in the field examining Mixtec and Mayan artifacts.  \r\n\r\nThe Mesoamerican project materials have been tested in classrooms on two college campuses.  They are now slated for beta-testing in 10 college and 20 high school classes during the 1999-2000 academic year.  The content materials support different levels of learning - from introductory, high school level to upper division undergraduate seminars, and also scholarly research.  \r\n \r\n",
