 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nelson Spruston\r\nIBN-9876032\r\n\r\nThe central nervous system (CNS) is made up of approximately 100 billion nerve cells. Most of these neurons communicate with one another at contact points called synapses. On one side of the synapse, the speaker (the presynaptic neuron) communicates via action potentials - electrical signals about 100 mV in amplitude and 1-2 ms in duration. On the other side, the listener (the postsynaptic neuron) interprets these signals arriving simultaneously from thousands of presynaptic neurons. This conversation is complicated by the fact that not all neurons speak the same language. Some neurons fire as few as a few action potentials per second; others fire as many as a thousand action potentials per second.  Differences are also observed in the patterns of action potential firing.  The biological underpinnings of action potential firing patterns are largely determined by pore-forming molecules called ion channels. A new avenue of research into the mechanisms responsible for variations in action potential firing patterns is to study the properties of ion channels located in different parts of the neuron. For example the axon, which generally forms the presynaptic side of the synapse, expresses different ion channels than the dendrites, which forms the postsynaptic side of the synapse. Here I propose to use new technology to study the properties of ion channels in the dendrites of neurons in an area of the brain called subiculum. This area is part of the hippocampus, which is involved in learning and memory. Neurons in the subiculum are known to generate clusters of action potentials called bursts. This pattern is very different than that of their nearest neighbors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, which are morphologically similar, but cannot generate bursts of action potentials.  I propose to perform experiments that will test the hypothesis that the bursting observed in subicular neurons is caused by specialized properties of sodium and/or potassium channels in the dendrites of these neurons. Using recently developed technology, the properties of channels in the dendrites of subicular neurons will be compared to those in CA1 neurons determined in previous and ongoing studies in my lab. Together with action potential recordings from dendrites, pharmacological manipulations, and computer modeling studies, I aim to elucidate the differences between subicular and CA1 neurons that are responsible for the very different action potential firing patterns in these two cell types. The proposal also contains an educational component designed to teach undergraduate students about the importance of neuronal specialization in the central nervous system, and the\r\nbiological mechanisms underlying neuronal diversity. \r\n",
