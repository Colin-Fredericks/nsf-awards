 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School of Engineering and Technology at California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA) will expand its Mother-Daughter Academy in order to attract and increase the number of female high school students to study engineering.  The Mother-Daughter Academy invites a group of mother-daughter teams, a female high school student and her mother to participate in an introduction to engineering workshop.  CSULA will conduct and evaluate the impact of two different models of our Mother-Daughter Academy and conduct a \"Summer Enhancement Workshop\" for daughters only.\r\n   The workshops will be a continuation and enhancement to the Mother-Daughter Academy which have been developed and conducted by the PI since 1995 at CSULA and funded by lottery monies of the State of California.  The workshops have been very well received and have achieved national focus through a featured article in the February 1998 ASEE PRIZM magazine and the CBS radio program the \"OSGOOD FILES\" (broadcast March 22 and 27, 1999).\r\n   The year-round academy will consist of six sessions, five hours long.  In session one, the Mother-Daughter participants will be introduced to engineering careers and female role models:  students, practicing engineers and faculty.  In the following four sessions, the participants will be introduced to different branches of engineering:  mechanical, civil, electrical, materials and manufacturing.  Each session will consist of lectures, demonstration experiments, and hands-on contests.  The last session will be a visit to a high-tech local company.  The more intensive two-week session will be conducted six three-hour evenings in June.  The summer workshop will teach the participants how to succeed in a university setting studying engineering.  It will include math and science enhancement classes, introduction to university, teamwork skills and time management classes.\r\n   The Mother-Daughter Academy participants will be recruited and selected from the schools participating in the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program schools.  The MESA office will be responsible for monitoring and tracking the success of the participants and their choice of career.\r\n   The Mother-Daughter Academy focuses on juniors in high school who, often even with sufficient math background, do not consider engineering as their future careers, due to the lack of female role models, encouragement of parents, as well as an insufficient understanding of engineering in general.  We hope to mitigate this deficiency and obtain the following goals:\r\na) Encourage girls to consider engineering as a viable option for their future careers,\r\nb) Dispel the myth that engineering is physically difficult and \"non-feminine\", \r\nc) Raise the level of scientific knowledge of the general population (especially female),\r\nd) Foster appreciation of the general public for engineering professions.\r\n   We hope that in the future this project will be disseminated around the country starting the movement BRING YOUR MOTHER TO SCHOOL,  to complement existing:  BRING YOUR DAUGHTERS TO WORK.\r\n",
