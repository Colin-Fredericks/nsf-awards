 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports research on the optical properties of metal-organic pi-conjugated polymers by Dr. Kirk S. Schanze of the Department of Chemistry, University of Florida.  The photophysical properties of several homologous series of mono-disperse, metal-organic pi-conjugated oligomers will be determined as models for higher molecular weight polymeric counterparts.  The specifc compounds to be studied are mono-disperse phenyleneethynylene and phenylenevinylene type oligomers that contain bipyridine units that can bind a variety of transition metal ions, particularly rhenium (I) and ruthenium (II).  Low-lying metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states delocalized over the entire oligomer are observed in these compounds.  In addition to the impact of the metal center on optical properties, the effects of oligomer topology, conjugation length and bandgap on the properties of the MLCT excited states will be investigated.  Some platinum-acetylide oligomers will also be studied.  Photophysical investigation will utilize absorption, photoluminescence, photoinduced absorption, transient FT-IR and FT-EPR spectroscopies and photoacoustic calorimetry.\r\n\r\nMetal-organic polymers exhibit properties that are a combination of those expected for the metal and organic components.   For this reason, they have potential for use in electronic devices that require electrochromism or photorefractivity or in specific detection of metal ions.  Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will gain experience in many synthetic techniques and use of sophisticated instrumentation.\r\n",
