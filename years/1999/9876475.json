 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to provide an understanding of the evolution of soot particles in turbulent nonpremixed flames, specifically how soot precursor particles are formed from high-molecular-weight compounds.  The aggregation kinetics of super-large aggregates in heavily sooting flames is explored.  The detailed nanostructure of soot particles is analyzed to help identify the source of the soot.  Two fuels are used:  methane for studies of soot precursor particles and acetylene for studies of high concentrations and large aggregates.  Experimental techniques include angular light scattering/extinction and thermophoretic sampling.  The effect of turbulence on the soot field is evaluated by analysis of the scattered signal.  Measurements of temperature, velocity, and radiative heat loss are also made.\r\n\r\nA broad range of educational activities is included consisting of development of courses and curricula, active participation of undergraduates in research, encouragement of members of underrepresented groups, involvement of industrial practice, and bringing computer technology and the interest to the classroom and instructional laboratory.\r\n",
