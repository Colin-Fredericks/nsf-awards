Sensory receptors associated with muscles are important in controlling these behaviors, but just how they do this is still not understood. One way of answering questions about this sensory control is to turn to animals with many fewer neurons in their nervous systems - invertebrates such as crabs, insects or snails - to analyze the neuronal mechanisms of this control. Hermit crabs live in and carry as protection cast-off snail shells. Their abdomens curl around and grasp the inner column of the shell; the muscles that lift the abdomen are controlled by a small number of identifiable motoneurons. These motoneurons are excited by sensory receptors signaling the force generated by the muscles. This positive feedback control is unusual, but positive feedback control is found in mammalian nervous systems as well. Thus, the hermit crab may be a useful model for understanding the general role of positive feedback in motor systems. Although a mathematical system model of this control has been developed, certain critical features have not been studied. This project will examine the signal processing performed by the sensory receptors and how their signals excite and inhibit interneurons and motoneurons that are involved in this control. Pharmacology is a useful tool for manipulating neuronal excitability; this project will support studies to identify molecules important in the hermit crab shell support behavior. These compounds can then be used to change the amount of feedback to determine why positive feedback in this system is beneficial and does not damage the abdomen. Simulation of the system will be used to study the critical features of this control and to compare its organization with mammalian postural systems.\r\n",
