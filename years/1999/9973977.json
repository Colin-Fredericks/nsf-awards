For severely deformed compounds, where the lattice is largely disordered, this ferromagnetic behavior is described by the local environment model in which the magnetic moment of a ferromagnetic element varies according to the number of its like nearest neighbors.  In less severely deformed compounds that deform by the glide of antiphase boundary (APB)-coupled dislocations, disorder resides within the APBs.  For this case, calculation of the magnetic behavior by applying the local environment model to the APBs between partial dislocations requires the use of physically unrealistic values for the width and thickness of the APBs.  Consequently, it appears that the major contribution to the strain-induced ferromagnetism in FeA1 is not due to the APBs between partial dislocation pairs (although these would contribute to a small extent).  It is proposed that the major contribution arises from the APB tubes which form behind gliding APB-coupled dislocations.  The aim of this project is to determine if the plastic strain-induced ferromagnetism that occurs in some magnetic element-containing intermetallic compounds can be modeled effectively by applying a local environment model to both the APBs in deformation-produced APB tubes and the APBs between partial dislocations.  To this end, measurements are made on a number of B2-structured FeAl alloys to determine the number of Fe atoms in these APBs that have three or more Fe nearest neighbors and a magnetic moment.  These results will be related to the saturation magnetization.  Having successfully developed this approach for FeAl, it will be applied to other appropriate intermetallic alloys.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research explores an interesting phenomenon whereby ferromagnetism is induced in some intermetallic alloys by plastic deformation.  The scientific explanation for this behavior is lacking, and there are possible technological applications as well, such as using the behavior to create embedded strain sensors in materials.\r\n***\r\n",
