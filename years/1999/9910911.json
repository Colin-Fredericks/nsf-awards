 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology Education is an organization consisting of education associations, businesses, scientific, mathematics and technology societies, and a network of local and state alliances.  It has a fifteen year history of fostering science, mathematics and technology education initiatives.  An important element of the Coalition's work is to inform members of Congress, federal agencies, and their staffs about the importance of preparing, passing, and funding legislation that provides support for programs directed at the preservice training and inservice professional development of science, technology, and mathematics teachers.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the Triangle Coalition initiated the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship program for outstanding science and mathematics teachers.  Fellows demonstrate exceptional expertise in teaching science, technology and/or mathematics in elementary or secondary schools and have an interest and willingness to be involved in public policy areas.  All candidates have been recognized for excellence through the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics or Science Teaching or some similar award.  Einstein Fellows bring to Congress and selected federal agencies involved in education the insights, extensive knowledge and practical experience teachers working in science and mathematics classrooms.\r\n\r\nThis project supports one Einstein Fellow assigned to NSF's Division of Research, Evaluation and Communication(REC) for an 11 month period and who works with program directors in REC on teacher education and classroom issues and programs.  The Fellow serves as a valuable resource by assisting in programs focusing on effective mathematics and science teacher development, preservice teacher preparation, projects that link teachers with classroom practices and student learning, and national teacher organization activities.\r\n\r\nThe project provides personal support for the Fellow while working at NSF in addition to a variety of supporting activities and programs designed specifically for all Fellows in the DC area.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
