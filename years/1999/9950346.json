 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Activity Based Physics Suite is a coordinated set of instructional materials designed for use in lecture sessions, laboratories, tutorials and studio courses.  Interactive Lecture Demonstrations engage students in the process of active learning in lecture environments.  The Interactive Lecture Demonstrations are potentially one of the most cost effective components of the Suite and are the centerpiece of this two year proof of concept project.  Interactive Lecture Demonstrations in kinematics, dynamics and energy are effective in improving student conceptual understanding.  An instructor performing an Interactive Lecture Demonstration uses a well-defined eight-step procedure in which students are asked to predict the outcomes of simple experiments, discuss predictions with their neighbors and observe and reflect on the outcomes of the actual experiment.  Experiment results are displayed on a real-time graph collected with microcomputer-based laboratory probes.  Demonstrations in new physics topics in mechanics, DC circuits, heat and thermodynamics and image formation are developed and tested in this project.  The new materials are tailored to coordinate with other Activity Based Physics Suite materials.  Development and alpha testing occur at the University of Oregon, Tufts University, and Dickinson College using conceptual evaluation instruments and beta testing occurs at a variety of other institutions engaged in using activity based materials.\r\n",
