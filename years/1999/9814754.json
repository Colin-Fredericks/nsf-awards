The preliminary results suggest that it is possible to quantitatively measure elemental concentrations in natural fluid inclusions by using a set of artificial fluid inclusions within microcapillary tubes. The research objectives are three-fold; 1) to build and evaluate a new simple heating stage for homogenization of multi-phase fluid inclusions, 2) to examine various calibration methodologies for analysis of single fluid inclusions, and 3) to apply the most suitable technique to examine four suites of well studied fluid inclusion samples. The calibration techniques include using;  1) the NIST glass reference\r\nmaterials, 2) a set of new microcapillary-type artificial fluid inclusions containing a larger selection of elements in standard solution including the rare earth elements (REE), and 3) synthetic fluid inclusions containing known concentrations of specific elements. Upon selection of the most suitable calibration technique, elemental concentrations in fluid inclusions in halite from sedimentary basins (e.g., Palo Dura and Paradox), quartz from silicic magmas (e.g., Capitan Pluton), and hydrothermal quartz from porphyry copper deposits ( e.g., Bingham and Sar Cheshmeh, Iran) will be determined.  For the sedimentary basins, fluid inclusions provide information on the origin of the fluid and its evolution in the context of understanding the sedimentary and diagenetic environments in which the halites were formed and the composition of the seawater at the time of basin formation. Analyses of magmatically-derived fluid inclusions are essential to unraveling the history of fluid-rock interactions, petrogenetic modeling, construction of more precise models of the metal-transport capabilities of these fluids, and refinement of models of ore metals sources in deposits associated with silicic magma systems.\r\n",
