 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis is a twelve month SGER award. Heterogeneity is a major issue in building distributed (e.g. multi-agent) information systems, and in communication in general. To get effective answers to queries or to develop a productive ongoing information-based interaction, participants have to build and maintain global correspondences between their respective local representations of information and activities. The dominant approaches to this (standards for representation and interchange, and translation to and from common base interlingua) depend on pre-established languages and rules for representing information and exchanging it. More importantly, theories that underpin these approaches depend on the prior existence of these structures and standards. Consequently, most effort goes into designing the standards and rules, rather than questioning the validity of these approaches as a whole or looking for a truly new and more flexible alternative. This project investigates a new, exploratory, dynamic approach, based on the evolution of interaction languages. The idea is to reverse the dominant picture described above, and to use interaction as the vehicle for creating emergent, dynamic bridges among information worlds. The eventual aim is to provide robust theories and techniques for the co-evolution of lexicons, syntaxes, grammars, semantics and eventually even higher-order social structures such as organizational forms and cultures (treated as information processing media) in distributed interaction. The new approach will improve the handling of openness, and will detail mechanisms and limits of language evolution, so we know just how heterogeneity will be bridgeable with limited resources or time. The research will a) investigate language generation/evolution in human collaborative settings, b) investigate computational theories of the limits and mechanisms of language evolution, c) hypothesize bounded mechanisms to explain the observed and theoretically possible processes, and d) build preliminary computational models as proofs of concept and to explore actual mechanisms that can be useful in fully-automated contexts. \r\n \r\n",
