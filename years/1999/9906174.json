 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Meterololgical Society (AMS), founded in 1919, is a scientific and professional body which promotes the development and dissemination of information of the atmospheric and related oceanic and hydrological sciences and the advancement of their professional applications.  Project ATMOSPHERE, is the AMS' comprehensive national program of teacher enhancement based on studies in the atmospheric sciences.  it is directed toward improving teacher effectiveness in generating interest and understanding in science, technology and mathematics among precollege students.  For number of years, the AMS Education Program has run an annual two-week workshop for Master Teachers of Atmospheric Sciences in coordination with the National Weather Service (NWS).  The program is held at the NWS Training Center in Kansas City, Missouri.  The purpose of the workshop is to provide learning experiences that focus on advances in observing, analyzing and forecasting weather, to examine ways in which the products of these can be employed in school studies of the atmospheric environment and prepare the trainees to conduct sessions in their home areas in the next school year.  This proposal is a request for partial support for a workshop for precollege teachers to be held in the summers of 1999 and 2000.  The Division of Atmospheric Sciences has provided partial funding for this workshop in the past and the present award continues support of a slightly higher level for the summers of 1999 and 2000.",
