Although exceptions to this \"rule\" have been reported in some specialized regions of the brain such as the hippocampus, the generation of new neurons in these germinal regions follows the same set of steps that occur prenatally. This suggests that the germinal zones found in the adult brain may be specialized \"holdover regions\" from embryonic development.  Recently, however, it has it been reported that precursor cells, those cells that produce the neurons and other cell types in the brain during the development, can be isolated from the spinal cord and other areas of the mature brain that are neither near to nor associated with specialized germinal zones.  These recent findings suggest that neuronal precursor cells may be distributed widely in the brain, and this raises the possibility that under appropriate conditions these precursor cells may be induced to generate new neurons.\r\n\r\n\tIn a previous series of experiments, Dr. Kalil has shown that when neurons in young brains are injured by cutting their axons, which disconnects these neurons from their target cells, that most of the injured neurons die, but that some of them appear to survive.  His work also has demonstrated in adult brains that almost all neurons that become disconnected from their target cells quickly die.  However, it appears that this cell death can be reduced significantly if specific proteins, known as neurotrophic factors, are administered soon after the injury.  \r\n\r\n\tIn this project, Dr. Kalil will extend his earlier research by investigating whether neurons in young and adult brains that appear to have survived after having had their axons cut,  may instead be new neurons that have been produced in response to the injury.  Dr. Kalil will determine if new neurons have been generated in response to injury of the brain by using a marker that will label the DNA only in those cells that have divided after the injury.  He will combine the DNA labeling of cells that have divided with staining by specific antibodies that recognize only neurons, in order to identify whether cells that have divided are nerve cells or some other type of  brain cell.  Using the same methods, Dr. Kalil also will investigate whether the administration of neurotrophic factors to the brain will help to promote the generation of new nerve cells after injury.  If the results from this project demonstrate that the brain is capable of generating new neurons in response to injury, they will reveal that the brain retains a greater degree of plasticity after birth than has been thought possible. This will open new opportunities for developing tools that take advantage of this plasticity to assist the brain in repairing itself after being damaged.\r\n",
