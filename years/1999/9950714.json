 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing three categories of educational materials, all based on the Java Programming Language -- (1) self-contained, versatile, mathematical activities, available over the Internet for use by individual students or by university or high school mathematics classes, (2) mathematically oriented Java programming tools (JavaBeans) to aid mathematics instructors in creating their own mathematics activities using Java, and (3) a series of tutorials, available over the Internet, to give mathematics instructors sufficient training in Java programming to develop their own mathematical activities with the help of a visual programming environment and the tools described above.\r\n\r\nThe project is proceeding in three stages. In the summer of 1999, develop and refine Java programming tools along with sample activities and a series of tutorials. In the summer of 2000, a workshop for twenty mathematics faculty members  on the use of the Java Programming tools and development of their own mathematics activities. These workshop participants continue developing activities throughout the year so that they may be displayed at a conference in the summer of 2001 open to the mathematical community to publicize the activities to mathematics faculty in the region. A web server devoted to this project houses the activities, Java language tutorials, and the programming tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
