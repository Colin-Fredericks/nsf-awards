The US organizers are Dr. Robert M. White, Chairman of Electrical Engineering and Dr. Adnan Akay, Chairman of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  The Turkish co-organizer is Dr. Nilufer Egrican, Dean of Mechanical Engineering at Istanbul Technical University in Istanbul, Turkey.   Six topics have been suggested for the discussion in the workshop: engineering in a multinational company, the design process, changes in engineering curricula, lifetime and distance learning, increased mobility and diversity, and the shift to the services industry.  In addition, the Turkish side will make presentations on: engineering curricula in Turkey, the engineering profession in Turkey, case studies of major engineering projects, impact of foreign presence, major factors affecting engineering in Turkey, and the role of distance learning.  The workshop will develop a clear understanding of Turkey's innovation process, the process by which its engineers are trained, technology is commercialized, how intellectual property is protected, as well as identify barriers to collaborations on international engineering projects.  Also it will define how engineering practices in a developing country are changing so that the US engineering community might take steps to better interface with such countries.\r\n\r\nScope:  This project will support participation by US engineers and engineering educators in a workshop that addresses the rapidly changing nature of engineering education and profession as they serve industries and the public sector.  The meeting will provide a forum for exchanging information between the United States and Turkey, and for learning especially how Turkey, a developing country, is dealing with these changes in the engineering profession and curricula.  The US participants' list includes several eminent men and women who have significant records in engineering education and who have responsible positions in engineering societies, industry, and government.  The project will be of mutual benefit to the United States and Turkey as well as to participants who may come from central Asia.  The project fits well within the objectives of the Division of International Programs.\r\n",
