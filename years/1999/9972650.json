 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antonovics\r\n9976250\r\n\r\nIt is commonly suggested that pathogens will evolve toward being harmless so as not to cause the extinction of the host population and hence of themselves.  This idea has been disputed on the grounds that selection for reduced virulence would require differential extinction of whole populations, a process that has been considered to be slow and ineffective.  This study will use theoretical models to investigate whether the evolution of reduced virulence can occur in situations where the host and pathogen are distributed over a large spatial area, but where their dispersal is much more local.   Model assumptions will be tested using the anther-smut disease of white campion.  This is as a well-studied disease that partly sterilizes its host.  \r\n\r\nGiven present day concerns about emerging infectious diseases, it is important to understand why some pathogens cause very severe disease symptoms, yet others have only a small effect on their hosts. Disease symptoms can change over time as a result of pathogen evolution, but the predicted direction and mechanism of such change has been very controversial.  This study will model the processes involved, and therefore help predict possible future directions of change in the severity of infectious diseases.   \r\n",
