 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Professor J.C. Bradley of Drexel University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.  The primary research objective of the proposed work is the development of a novel electrodeposition method for the preparation of metal catalysts.  The promise of the particular method proposed is that the catalytic activity of the material produced can be modulated by control of the electric fields used during the deposition process.  Spatial control in the creation of bimetallic catalyst systems may also be achieved.   The educational aspect of the proposal focuses on the Peak Performance education and training program already in place and successful at the PI's institution.  \r\n\r\nThe project supported by this proposal has as its focus the development of methods for contact-less deposition of metal and mixed metal layers on insulating supports.  An immediate application of the work is the creation of very small wires on silicon substrates.  Using the contact-less method minimizes metal atom diffusion and allows the structures generated to be very small.  This technology may be of use in fabrication of the next generation of integrated chips.\r\n",
