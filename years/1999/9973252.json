Group testing algorithms are search algorithms.  If one thinks of a search algorithm as a battery of tests, then no test in a nonadaptive group testing algorithm can be modified by the results of any other test.  Thus the order in which the tests are performed is irrelevant.  Depending upon the real world problem that is being modeled, it is often the case that the tests can be carried out simultaneously.  Hence, nonadaptive search algorithms are well suited for parallel processing and computing when memory or data storage capability is limited.  Every parallel algorithm is nonadaptive.  In this project, we propose to use and develop combinatorial and algebraic codes to construct nonadaptive group testing algorithms from the matrix representations of these codes.  A specific aim of this proposal is to develop more efficient high throughput group testing algorithms that find a large number of positives when testing error rates can range up to 10%.\r\n\r\nFrom an applied point of view, the ability to effectively and efficiently search for unknown objects is essential to many endeavors in the areas of biotechnology, telecommunications, and national security.  The unknown\r\nobjects may be the locations of particular DNA sequences or a group of computer hackers.  Because of their computational power, group testing algorithms play a pivotal role in the Human Genome Project and they are essential in the screening many different kinds of biological and chemical data bases.  Group testing algorithms have also been applied to computer network protocols and can be used in the development of computer intrusion detection software. \r\n\r\n",
