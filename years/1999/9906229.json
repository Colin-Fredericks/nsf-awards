The proposed framework solves many of the problems encountered in previous attempts to estimate workers' valuation of fringe benefits, most notably the bias caused by fixed individual-specific unobservables. This study will also estimate the value to workers of the characteristics of employer-provided health insurance plans with new nationally representative data. Additionally, the study will extend that model to estimate the loss of consumer surplus that may be associated with the contraction of the health plan choice set of many workers that has occurred as employers have increasingly chosen to offer employees only a choice among HMO's rather than among both HMO's and traditional fee-for-service plans.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals, the researcher will first develop the discrete choice model that represents workers' valuation of fringe benefits. The model will use choices of workers who are offered a menu of fringe benefits with different prices to the employee to understand how much workers are willing to pay in foregone wages for additional benefits. One major advantage of this approach is that the comparison among observed alternatives that determines which plan a worker will choose differences away unobservable individual fixed effects believed to be the main problem in estimating the standard compensating differentials hedonic model. The researcher will compare the discrete choice model of fringe benefits to the hedonic model traditionally used to analyze this question and assess advantages and disadvantages relative to the traditional model. Second the analyst will develop a model of health plan choice and a methodology to quantify possible losses in consumer surplus due to contraction in, or other changes to, workers' choice sets in the wake of large changes in firm health benefit offerings in recent years. The proposed model will value contractions in workers' health plan choices using cross-worker differences in available choice sets using a method similar to that developed by Trajtenberg (1989) to value year-to-year increases in consumer surplus that occur as consumers' choices increase as product innovations occur. Third, the researcher will prepare data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Household Component and the MEPS Insurance Component and merge the two to construct a dataset with which to estimate these models. The merged data will include individual and family demographic and health data, employment, income and other important worker characteristics, as well as firm-level data provided by workers' firms, including information on the health plans offered by the firm and which of the offered plans was chosen by this worker. Last, the analyst will use these data to estimate both proposed models.\r\n\r\nThe study will make a contribution both methodologically and empirically. Methodological advances include the development of an alternative to the hedonic model for estimating workers' preferences for fringe benefits and the adaptation of the model of Trajtenberg to a different setting. The estimates obtained will be useful in policy evaluation of many sorts. Estimates of workers' valuation of fringe benefits are necessary to evaluate policies such as mandated employer-provided health insurance and tax incentives for fringe benefits. Estimates of the value of health coverage provisions and variety of health plan offerings will contribute substantially to the current debate in Congress on how to regulate the managed care industry.\r\n\r\n",
