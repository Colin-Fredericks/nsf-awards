The researchers, two cultural anthropologists, will study how culturally specific understandings of normality, risk, and personal responsibility are expressed through the diagnosis of fetal anomaly by ultrasound imaging, and will explain the variation between practices in Greece and in Canada by variations in cultural understandings.  The project will test hypotheses about differences in concepts about medical authority and morality which affect doctor-patient interaction; about how culturally specific meanings of the \"normal body\" result in differences between Greek and Canadian couples' experiences and causal explanations of fetal anomaly; and about variations in the cultural definition of risk.  The methods used will be participant observation in hospitals and clinics in Athens, Greece and in Victoria, Vancouver and Toronto, Canada, as well as interviews with pregnant women and their partners who have had experience with fetal anomaly; interviews with health practitioners, and archival research.\r\n\tThis research will advance theory about the relationship between conceptions of the \"normal\" body and cultural context, relating norms of the appropriate or ideal body to historically specific social and political orders.  The project will also contribute to the understanding of cross-cultural specifics of biomedical and bioethical beliefs and practices. \r\n",
