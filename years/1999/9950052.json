 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge facing today's manufacturing industry is the timely delivery of quality products to consumers. What is required is the use of technology tools and simulations to shorten the design and delivery cycle of new products. While this emerging technology holds great promise, no  curriculum exists at the community college level that integrates manufacturing and simulation skills to prepare technicians for the 21st century workforce.\r\n\r\nThis project supports systemic reform in response to industry need through industry mapping, curriculum development, professional development and dissemination.  It also provides a forum for industry to work with faculty to develop curriculum.  This curriculum provides model solutions to technical problems in real life settings to meet the requirements of the 21st century manufacturing workforce, and incorporates advanced math and science components throughout newly developed manufacturing simulation technology curriculum (MST). The project is creating avenues through workplace experiences for manufacturers to hire MST graduates from diverse backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe program architecture to be used was developed at Sinclair's NSF-funded AIM Center and features a competency-based modularized curriculum to develop a \"systems-level\" MST associate degree program.  The focus for this project is robotic simulation.  A Tech Prep (TPAD) curriculum, and support materials for MST graduates are being identified and specialty modules developed. Subject matter experts from industry, education and the federal sector identify industry needs and develop curriculum in MST.  Instructional materials are being delivered through distance learning so that high schools, community colleges and four year universities have access to curricula.  In order to carry out these plans, a partnership has been formed with other community and four-year colleges, public school districts, industry and government.\r\n\r\nThis project is identifying TPAD curriculum for Grades 11 through 14 and adults re-entering the workforce. It is supplying skilled workers to support emerging manufacturing simulation technology industry, and is providing new career opportunities for women, Hispanics, African-Americans, and disabled persons. Faculty are being trained on the use of simulation technology/integrating technology into curriculum/and pedagogy.  A virtual electronic library supports and distributes MST curricula including a repository of simulation applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
