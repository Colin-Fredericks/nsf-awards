 "awd_abstract_narration": "9877107\r\n\r\nMany systems are composed of, or can be viewed as, complex subsystems of simple components whose behavior within the system can be quite complicated due to component interactions and dependencies.  These dependencies may occur, for example, because dynamic redistribution of stresses occurs among the remaining components when some components fail.  The dynamic approach is to incorporate the mechanism of failure into the model to account for such interactions and dependencies, as well as to use micro-level (component) relationships to determine the macro-level (system) failure.  There are several important, but difficult, issues regarding reliability, or failure, models for systems in such dynamic environments.  The main objectives of this research are to study the following five issues:  (1) appropriate modeling of component and system reliability based on the physics of failure and the assumed environment, (2) incorporating component reliability information into the determination of system reliability in a dynamic setting, (3) identifying critical configurations of components that cause failure, (4) determining approximate reliability models for complex systems that are tractable for statistical inference and data analytic purposes, and (5) incorporating multivariate failure mechanisms into modeling system reliability.  While (2)-(5) have been studied extensively for coherent systems of independent components, models incorporating dependencies among components would yield more realistic failure analysis of complex systems.  Such models would have direct application to many problems of current importance including, for example, failure of modern complex materials and other structures and of networks of large numbers of components.\r\n\r\nThe proposed investigations of the mechanisms for failure of complex systems are important, for example, in modeling and understanding the relationship between the micro-level (component) and macro-level (system) size scales of failure.  The statistical methodology and probability models to be developed will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding of the random nature of failure mechanisms at both the component level and system level, and the associated statistical Inferences for failure of general systems in various applications.  Particular applications are in prediction of the reliability of structures made from composite materials (such as carbon composites) or \"systems\" such as large computer networks.  Also, the new, nonstandard statistical models developed in this study based on cumulative damage concepts are not well understood with respect to sampling and inference from observed failure data.  Hence, an important goal of the project is to investigate these aspects of the models.  Tactical and competitive advantages can be gained since the theoretical models developed here should lead to better system reliability prediction and its implication to system design and the system maintenance and inspection policies.\r\n",
