Her project deals with the structure of the minimal free resolutions of Monomial and Toric ideas.  Ideas and methods from commutative algebra, combinatorics, and the topological theory of subspace arrangements will be applied to study such resolutions.  Constructions previously used to describe the cohomology of complex subspace arrangements will be adapted to yield minimal free resolutions. The goal is to build highly structured resolutions and subcomplexes of resolutions, and to obtain bounds on Betti Numbers and regularity.   \r\n\r\nCommutative algebra is the study of the fundamental structures of mathematics. Results of commutative algebra have found uses in communications, security and robotics. By studying abstract mathematical objects, mathematicians gain deeper insight in many other branches of mathematics. The important area of modern geometry known as algebraic geometry is the strongest and most fruitful mathematical example of this line of attack.  Algebraic objects are substituted for geometric objects, and the powerful and abstract methods of commutative algebra are applied to further our understanding of the geometry.  Dr. Peeva's research should have immediate and direct implications in geometry and combinatorics. \r\n",
