Currently, there are three recognized species of rats resident in Hawaii, the Polynesian rat R. exulans, the wharf rat R. norvegicus, and the roof rat R. rattus. All three species are strongly implicated in threatening native or endemic Hawaiian organisms with extinction. These three species are known to differ in ecology and in their impacts on native vegetation. Recently, the morphologically and chromosomally polymorphic roof rat was divided into two separate species, R. rattus and the \"Asian rat\" R. tanezumi. These two species co-occur on many Pacific oceanic islands, but in external morphology are very difficult to tell apart. Definitive methods of identification are a requisite first step ultimately to managing any invasive species or ecological pest. These two species are currently identified by their number of chromosomes; but karyotyping, or the preparation of chromosomes in order to study their shape and number, is only possible if animals are collected alive. This research is focused on analyzing nuclear and mitochondrial DNA from numerous samples of Pacific rat populations in order to discover genetic markers unique to each of the two species.\r\n\tThe benefits of DNA-based methods include: (1) freshly caught, poorly preserved, and probably even museum specimens could be identified to species, assuming sufficient DNA remains for amplification and analysis; (2) surveys of natural ecosystems could be conducted more rapidly than with traditional karyotyping; (3) genetic data may provide additional information about population sizes and immigration rates, along with species identification. Precisely delimiting the geographic range of the Asian rat R. tanezumi in the Pacific region will allow studies of its ecology in areas where it has recently invaded.\r\n",
