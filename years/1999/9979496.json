 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goals of this GK-12 project, Partnership for Research in Inquiry-based MSE Education (PRIME), are to enhance learning among middle school students, teachers, and GK-12 Fellows in math, science, and engineering (MSE); enhance the diversity of the MSE workforce; and develop a cadre of scientists and engineers who will enter the workforce ready, willing, and able to continuously improve the quality of K-12 education in the next century. PRIME is a partnership among five Seattle-area school districts; three NSF Local Systemic Initiatives; and fifteen academic departments in mathematics, science, and engineering, faculty in the College of Education and four diversity programs at the University of Washington in Seattle. PRIME's conceptual focus is inquiry-based MSE education in middle school settings with diverse student and teacher populations. Of 22,585 middle school students potentially affected by PRIME, nearly one-fifth (19%) are African American, Native American, or Hispanic. A summer learning sciences institute prepares PRIME Fellows to engage in partnerships with middle school teachers and students in MSE. This institute focuses on middle school learning and teaching, assessment practices, classroom instruction, and diversity. The institute prepares the Fellows to engage in sustained partnerships with classroom teachers. Fellows provide their disciplinary expertise to enhance classroom learning opportunities while also developing an increased understanding of pedagogy and diversity. The partnerships focus their efforts on the adaptation and localization of exemplary curricular materials. PRIME studies these sustained partnerships and disseminates the products of their efforts through annual regional showcases for teachers.\r\n",
