 "awd_abstract_narration": "A general theoretical framework for fault detection and diagnosis will be developed.  The main elements include fault identification, fault reconstruction,  and selection of the appropriate model dimensions.  A novel subspace control approach that can provide corrections to faults or disturbances in real time will be developed.  Fault detection will be accomplished by monitoring two detection indices.  The squared prediction error index detects significant variability in the residual subspace, and the Hotelling T2 index indicates operation beyond the historical limits.  An objective approach to determining the number of principal components for best fault construction is proposed.  Multivariate statistical methods, including principal component analysis and partial least squares, will be used to analyze the data and partition the measurement space into a normal and an abnormal subspace.  Because up to 40% of manufacturing costs are spent on maintenance and fault situation management, this project will have potential application to a problem of general industrial importance.  If successful, the project will accomplish the following four goals: (1) develop a novel root-cause analysis approach by fault reconstruction and identification, (2) provide an objective, well-established criterion for determining the number of principal components, (3) provide an integrated approach for subspace control and monitoring, and (4) establish a fundamental theory for fault detection, identification, reconstruction, and determination of the number of principal components.",
