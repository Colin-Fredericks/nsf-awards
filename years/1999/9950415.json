 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Austin College Department of Physics is adapting active-learning techniques from several sources for use in a new small multipurpose classroom-laboratory in the teaching of introductory physics and astronomy. In our two-semester calculus-based Introduction to Physics we are adapting and implementing Workshop Physics developed by Priscilla Laws at Dickinson College. The same classroom-laboratory space, equipped with seventeen networked Macintosh G3 computers accommodating a maximum of thirty-two students, is the site of an algebra-based introductory physics course in which we are implementing and adapting the Peer Instruction technique (Mazur, 1997). Real time student interactivity is achieved through a trial networked version of Classtalk  developed by Better Education Inc.  We are adapting experiments from the RealTime Physics suite developed by Sokoloff, Thornton and Laws for use in this course so as to bring them into synchrony with the Workshop Physics weekly schedule. We use appropriate evaluation instruments, such as the widely-used conceptual assessments, to monitor our efforts making the results available via physics meetings, web pages, and articles in appropriate periodicals. The same facility is used to adapt and implement activity-based materials in a one-semester introduction to astronomy for non-scientists. Specifically, we are adapting and expanding upon the peer instruction techniques developed by  Paul Green at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics, the discovery based astronomy activities (Robbins, et. al., 1995), and astronomy modules developed by Project CLEA (Marshall at Gettysburg College).\r\n",
