 "awd_abstract_narration": "The highly complex and interdisciplinary nature of modern engineering systems necessitates synergies among the different engineering and science disciplines. An integral part of such systems is the design of advanced control strategies. This project focuses on the development of a Control Design Laboratory involving multidisciplinary robotic, chemical process, electric, machine, and energy conversion systems. A unique feature of the laboratory is the adaptation from the NSF funded workshop \"New Directions in Control Engineering Education\" of an Internet-based remote access system (RAS) for the laboratory testbeds .  These modular and multidisciplinary testbeds allow laboratory experiences in the integration of sensors, actuators, electronics, computer interfaces, networking, and software.  Laboratory manuals for each testbed are under development.  In addition to engineering students , the project targets include pre-college students and teachers through their participation in pilot-testing and implementation of experimental test-beds.  Cross-disciplinary interactions are promoted utilizing a team oriented approach to the pedagogy of design and control of the multi-disciplinary experimental test-beds.  The project impacts the curricula of mechanical, aerospace, manufacturing, electrical, and chemical engineering departments as well as that of the computer science department.",
