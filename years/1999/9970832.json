 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study proposes to fill the gaps in knowledge regarding the chief issues in systemic reform that require better theoretical specification, and the availability of information on the performance of the system.\r\n\r\nIt will address the following research questions:\r\n\r\n1. How much reform is occurring in the six cases, and is there a feasible method for measuring the extent of such reform?\r\n2. In each of the six cases, what has been the role of NSF's SSI in producing reform?\r\n3. If reform has been occurring, what are the signs that student performance also is improving?\r\n\r\nThe researchers will determine how much statewide systemic reforming in science and mathematics education is occurring in five study states (Connecticut, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Texas, and Vermont) and one territory (Puerto Rico).  The proposed study will include a cross-case analysis in addition to the individual case studies to target the understanding of systemic reform on a broad-scale range.  The case studies will be based on quantitative and qualitative data collected directly from the field and from a variety of archival sources.\r\n",
