 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate laser-target interaction during pulsed laser ablation using a high average power, tunable, fast repetition rate, picosecond-pulse duration free electron laser (FEL). The study is expected to lay the groundwork for determining laser parameters for optimization of film properties with the ultimate research goal of producing high quality thin films and multilayers, specifically of magnetic and metallic materials. The starting point in understanding the deposition of thin films is understanding the laser-target interaction and the generation of the ablated material plume. Three materials will be studied: a magnetic material (Co), a noble metal (Ag), and a dielectric (LiNbO3). The laser source will be Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility Free Electron Laser. The laser-target interaction will be studied in-situ by ultrafast pump-probe optical microscopy, spectral analysis of the ablated plasma, pump-probe reflectivity and ex-situ using surface characterization techniques.\r\n%%% \r\nThis is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge relevant to the deposition of thin films and multilayers of magnetic and metallic materials. The project also places emphasis on the integration of research and education by incorporating graduate student participation into research and  the results of research into classroom activities in a university setting. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). \r\n***\r\n",
