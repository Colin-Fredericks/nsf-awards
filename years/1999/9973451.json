 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on examining the intrahousehold issues surrounding household risk management decisions.  A large literature has emerged on consumption and income smoothing in developing countries which shows how informal finance and insurance systems can be remarkably effective in minimizing household consumption variability.  The models assume that the decision-making unit is the household and implicitly assume that all individuals within the household have the same interest in minimizing household income variability and will benefit equally from actions to do so.   However, recent literature on intrahousehold resource allocation encourages us to be much more attentive to the dynamics within households to understand household economic decisions.  This literature provides a number of insights into how there may be both conflict and cooperation among household members regarding risk management strategies.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research focuses on understanding why individuals may choose not to pool all of their income risk with other household members.  An explicit question is whether partial risk sharing leaves some household members particularly vulnerable to negative shocks.  A theoretical model will be developed, extending the researcher's previous work, which asks how household expenditure patterns respond to income shocks received by individuals within the household.  The theoretical framework will be tested in the context of pastoralist societies in East Africa.  Understanding the risk management strategies of these societies is important for development assistance programs.  The pastoralists of East Africa are among the world's poorest people, and they inhabit fragile ecosystems that are vital for the survival of many wildlife species.  Lessons learned from this research will also be applicable to understanding the intrahousehold dimensions of risk management in other societies. \r\n\r\nThis POWRE grant will support the investigator to pursue and extend her research as she moves from a liberal arts college to a faculty position at Yale.  At Yale, she will be able to interact with economists and with scholars from many disciplines in the International Relations and Agrarian Studies programs.  This is an important opportunity for her career development, especially since she works in a discipline where women continue to be underrepresented. \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n",
