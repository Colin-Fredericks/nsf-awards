 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for the acquisition of a Raman Spectrometer to be used in a new materials characterization module being implemented into the undergraduate Instrumental Analysis Laboratory (CHEM 5650). The instrument will also be utilized in the undergraduate research program, Chemical Problems (CHEM 4800). The requested funds will be used to acquire a Wizard 1200 Raman Spectrometer (ChrQmgx, Albuquerque, NM) with a fiber optic probe to be extensively used in a new materials characterization module. This instrument is extremely versatile, allowing for spectroscopic studies of gases, liquids and solids, and can be configured to perform not only Raman but also fluorescence, absorption and emission measurements. The proposed Raman experiments will involve most aspects of the analytical process (problem identification, sampling, sample preparation, measurement, data analysis, and interpretation). The instrumentation will significantly improve the quality of instruction and practical training offered by our Department in the fields of vibrational spectroscopy and materials characterization.\r\n\r\nA program has been initiated to revise and modernize the undergraduate Instrumental Analysis Laboratory (CHEM 5650). A major change involves the implementation of a Problem-based Learning (PBL) approach. \"Analytical chemistry is essential to much of the nation's science and engineering. So to ensure that the nation's technical needs will be met, the undergraduate analytical curriculum (e.g., Instrumental Analysis and Chemical Problems) needs to better prepare students to become problem solvers. In turn, this preparation will give students a broader range of career opportunities. If the learning is exciting and relevant, analytical science courses may attract more young people into the sciences\" (1998 NSF-sponsored study titled Curriculum Reform in the Analytical Sciences). Curriculum revisions are focused in two areas: separation science and materials characterization.\r\nDue to increased demand for science-based curricula, this Junior College has instituted a Natural Science program and is developing science courses for serving nonscience majors. A new interdisciplinary course entitled Environmental Quality is being developed to satisfy new science core requirements for majors in the Liberal Arts and Education Transfer programs. This project seeks matching funds for the acquisition of equipment for student-based environmental quality assessments of the Lackawanna River, its tributaries, and other water sources which are contaminated with acid mine drainage and combined sewer overflows. Assessment strategies will be based on examining actual and potential impacts on water quality and biota, specifically metals, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, and benthic macroinvertebrates. Portable field analytical instrumentation, in addition to a new laboratory spectro -photometer, will be used to estimate pollutant loads and to evaluate levels of chemical constituents in areas of suspected impact and non-impacted control (reference) sites. Students will become familiar with the scientific methodologies involved in sample collection and analysis, as well as the interrelationships between the biological, chemical, and hydrological components of the environment. Results of the project will be evaluated in terms of scientific validity, contributions to environmental databases, and its impact on student learning. Dissemination of results will occur through research publications and conference presentations.",
