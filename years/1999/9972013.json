 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDMS-9972013\r\n\r\nThis award will support research on two main problems. The first is a study of \r\nmathematical models for polymer desorption.  In particular, the goal is \r\nto model such anomalous behavior as skinning, where the penetrant substance\r\ncan become trapped inside the polymer matrix.  The second part of \r\nthe proposal is a study of the spatial nature of the nonlocal effects in \r\npolymer diffusion, which is caused by the disparate length scales in the \r\npolymer network.  The common problem in describing diffusion in polymers is that\r\nthe diffusion of the penetrant molecules in a polymer \r\nentanglement network cannot be described by the usual models (Fick's Law) alone.\r\nRather, one must incorporate other nonlocal effects, using hereditary integral kernels.\r\nThis results in a model that contains a nonlinear partial integrodifferential equation.  \r\nThis problem is perhaps best described as a moving boundary-value problem where\r\ntwo distinct operators govern the phenomena on the two sides of the boundary.  \r\nIn this work, existing models will be refined, and studies of diffusion and dissolution \r\nwill performed and compared with experiments.  Different geometries and the effects \r\nof swelling on the system will also be considered. \r\n\t\r\nBecause of their unusual, yet useful, properties, polymers have become invaluable \r\nin industrial production.  Diffusion in polymers does not follow the standard physical \r\nlaws as diffusion in other media, and hence a new mathematical approach is needed.  \r\nIn particular, the penetrant molecules diffuse through interconnected polymer \"pockets\", \r\nwhich leads to nonlocal effects.  A mathematical model incorporating these effects \r\nwill be formulated and solved.  One area where polymers are used is in pharmaceutical \r\napplications, where the polymer is often saturated with a penetrant (such as a medicine), \r\nand then allowed to release the penetrant slowly.  Several mathematical studies in various \r\nconfigurations, such as cylindrical devices, will be undertaken to analyze these phenomena.  \r\nThus the research will have direct impact on nonmathematical areas, such as materials science \r\nand pharmaceuticals. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
