 "awd_abstract_narration": "\t\"Mexico 2000:  Voting, Campaign Effects, and Democratization\" is designed to document campaign effects and voting behavior in Mexico's presidential elections of 2000.  Its imediate goal is to enhance knowledge of voting behavior and campaign effects in Mexico.  Its larger goal is to illuminate the impact of campaigns on electoral outcomes in contexts of weak partisan attachments, high uncertainty, and high stakes - that is, in the circumstances confronting most new democracies today.  As the first major study of its kind in an emerging democracy, it should prove valuable to a range of scholars interested in voting behavior, campaign effects, political communication, and democratization, regardless of their geographical specialization.\r\n\r\n\tThe project consists of a combination of five panel and cross-sectional surveys over the course of the 2000 campaign in Mexico.  Each round of the survey is designed to measure different correlates of voting behavior (such as demographics, media exposure, political knowledge and engagement, opinion about salient public issues, attitudes toward the main parties and candidates, and impressionsof the electoral process) and different types of campaign effects (such as contact with party activists, media exposure and attention, political advertisements, and the presidential debate).  In all, the surveys cover more than 125 items for the 4,000 respondents interviewed twice and 70 items for those 2,000 respondents interviewed once.  Data generated by the project, along with the necessary background and technical information, are available publicly through the Harvard-MIT Data Cente,r the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California at San Diego, and the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (ITAM) in Mexico City.     \r\n",
