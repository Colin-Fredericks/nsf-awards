 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is facilitating the development of the environmental literacy program at Mount Holyoke College, which recently created the Center for Environmental Literacy.  The Center's mission is to create and maintain an environmentally sustainable campus community.  \r\n\r\nOne of the approaches to accomplishing this mission is to increase the environmental content of all departmental and interdisciplinary majors.  One of the greatest obstacles to accomplishing that goal is the lack of time and resources available to interested faculty, as well as less than complete awareness of opportunities and methods for pursuing this objective in their disciplines.   This project will work with faculty to increase the environmental content of current Mount Holyoke curricula be developing teaching modules that faculty can incorporate into existing courses.  \r\n\r\nThe modules will be designed to develop environmental awareness in students within their own discipline or major, and provide opportunities to explore links among different disciplines.  This work will not only be incorporated into courses at Mount Holyoke College, but are also intended for use by other colleges and universities interested in increasing the environmental literacy of their students.  \r\n\r\nThis grant is supporting the PI for 18 months as a visiting faculty member dedicated to the development of course modules.  The experience gained in this project is expected to prepare the PI for continued work with both Mount Holyoke and other academic institutions.",
