 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project is designed to illustrate the intricate nexus between the natural and built worlds, cultural and national constructs, and historical memory by examining, through a case study,  the role that conservation-based civic societies and activities played in defining Estonia's relationship to the natural world.  Estonia's independence movement was sparked by Moscow's plans to expand environmentally disastrous phosphate mines in the republic. In turn, the nation's drive for independence and Estonians' concern about severe environmental degradation in their republic had enormous implications for the entire Soviet Union. Instead of joining other Soviet republics in voicing disgust at Moscow's \"ecological illiteracy,\" Estonia assumed the role of vanguard in seeking environmental, economic and political concessions from the Kremlin. This study makes three contributions to environmental history. First, the research fills a gap in the existing historical and environmental literature. Because of the logistical difficulty in dealing with the numerous and difficult languages used historically in the Baltic states, English language environmental histories of the former Soviet Union  are almost entirely Russo-centric. Western scholars have placed Estonia's environmental movement in the framework of a larger, all-Soviet or pan-East European phenomenon. Moreover, Indigenous Estonian (and Russian-Estonian) scholars have neglected the broader topic; they emphasize narrow and temporally limited aspects of Estonia's environmental history. Second, the project shows that environmental (or conservationist) sensibilities began not in or immediately before Gorbachev's glasnost era but earlier, during the previous century when the Estonian nation was developing and defining its national consciousness. By drawing attention to a longer developed environmental ethic, the project intends to show that Estonia's conservation-based civic institutions had, over time, successfully linked the concept of nation with that of territory and environment. The scientific expertise which helped buttress attempts to protect Estonia's embattled natural world by extension served to protect the Estonian nation as well. Finally, this study will assist scholars studying themes as diverse as industrial colonialism, population transfers, folklore and civil society, and provide important information for future cross-cultural and international research into human interaction with the natural and constructed world.\r\n",
