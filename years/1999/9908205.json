 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to support the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Ceramic and Composite Materials at the University of New Mexico with Rutgers University as the affiliate partner.  The mission of the center is to develop new, interdisciplinary technologies to make the United States more competitive in ceramic science and engineering and to transfer these technologies to its industrial members.  The center will combine the research on ceramic synthesis and highly loaded polymers at the University of New Mexico with the research on ceramic processing and microstructure-property relationships at Rutgers University.  The focus of the research is on the science and technology needed to synthesize and process advanced materials with the microstructures needed to fulfill the property requirements as well as cost, shape, and reliability requirements of emerging engineering applications.  The approach includes research aimed at understanding the relationships between starting materials, chemistry, and processing parameters to the structures and properties of the finished materials. Processing techniques used are sol-gel synthesis, vapor phase synthesis, and powder processing.  The Center will be led by an Executive Director at the University of New Mexico and a Director at Rutgers University.  The Center has an Industrial Advisory Board composed of representatives from the industry affiliates and partners.",
