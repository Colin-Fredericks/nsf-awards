 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the grant research is on a set of issues that have come to occupy great theoretical attention in recent attempts to understand the basic phenomenon of associative learning.  It concerns the roles played by \"elemental\" versus\" configural cues\" in such learning.  The research uses an experimental approach that is shared by many investigators, namely the use of simple, well-controlled instances of associative learning about which a great deal of behavioral and biological information is available (in this case, pavlovian-like eyeblink conditioning in the rabbit).  Its aim is to evaluate a \"componential\" model in which elemental and configural cues are generally presumed to compete with each other within an adaptive-network environment.\r\n\r\nAssociative learning is a basic form of learning that is generally thought to be central to the scientific understanding of human memory and cognition.  The conception that is under evaluations holds promise of providing a principled account of the very different patterns of generalization and discrimination that is observed under what might appear to be minor variations in the conditions of associative  training.  The work should contribute to the continued development of quantitative, \"neural-network\" theory.\r\n",
