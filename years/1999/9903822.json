The final tests of the complete system will be done in the ISL, with interaction with CDM Optics.  Simulations can be done with the optics and the signal processing of the system together so that the signal processing algorithms can be refined, and any modifications made to the optical system.  During this work, tolerances on the optical elements will be determined.  The signal processing algorithm will be put on a processing chip so that preliminary experiments can be started.  The final experimental system will be assembled in the ISL and the experiments completed at CDM Optics.  If the project is successful, then CDM Optics can commercialize the technology in applications that require video-rate images, starting with industrial inspection and the positioning of small parts.\r\n\r\n",
