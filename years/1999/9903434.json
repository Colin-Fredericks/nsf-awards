 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nPaleontological research over the past fifty years or so has demonstrated\r\nin spectacular fashion the significance of sites in East Africa for\r\ndocumenting the earliest stages in human evolution.  Laetoli in northern\r\nTanzania is renowned as one of the most important of these sites.  Previous\r\nresearch at Laetoli by Mary Leakey in the late 1970s and early 1980s led to\r\nmajor new discoveries that have contributed significantly to an improved\r\nunderstanding of the evolutionary history of humans and of African faunas\r\nin general.  Although this research has laid an excellent foundation for\r\ngeological and paleontological investigations in the region, it is evident\r\nthat there is still a great deal that can be learned about the course and\r\ncontext of human evolution from continued studies at Laetoli.\r\n        The aim of this project is to continue with a long-term program of\r\ngeological and paleontological research at Pliocene localities in the\r\nLaetoli area that was initiated by the PI in the summer of 1998.  The main\r\nobjectives are to recover additional fossil hominids and to obtain more\r\ndetailed contextual information on the paleontology, geology, dating, and\r\npaleoecology.  The proposed program of field research and exploration in\r\nthe Laetoli area offers the potential to yield new data that will\r\ncontribute significantly to a better understanding of the fossil evidence\r\nfor human evolution and its paleoecological context.  Results from these\r\ninvestigations will be used to address several key problems in the study of\r\npaleoanthropology: (1) clarification of the phylogenetic relationships and\r\ntaxonomy of early hominids; (2) a better appreciation of the anatomy and\r\npaleobiology of Australopithecus afarensis - a pivotal species in the\r\ninterpretation of the early evolutionary history of humans, and (3) the\r\ndevelopment of a more detailed and critical assessment of the\r\npaleoecological associations of the Laetoli hominids in order to identify\r\nfactors that may have contributed to the initial divergence and subsequent\r\ndiversification of early hominids in Africa.\r\n",
