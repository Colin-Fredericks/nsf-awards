 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies is a marine laboratory operated by San Francisco State University (SFSU), a predominantly undergraduate institution with a 57% minority enrollment.  The Romberg Tiburon Center (RTC) is the only academic research facility on San Francisco Bay, one of the largest estuaries in the U.S.  It is a facility with a tightly focused research mission aimed toward gaining fundamental understanding of the physical and biological processes of San Francisco Bay and its surrounding environments.  Research scientists at RTC have trained and supported over 80 graduate and undergraduate students in the last five years and have extensive collaborations with fellow university, and federal and local environmental agency scientists.  Current research projects being conducted by the Center's 18 research scientists and their students range from studies of detoxification mechanisms of estuarine invertebrates to studies of plankton dynamics in the Antarctic.  Three new researchers, and a new tenure track faculty member, joined RTC in August 1998.  As continuing evidence of its dedication to The Center, the University has committed to hire four additional tenure-track faculty in the next 5 years.  Additionally, RTC initiated a Visiting Scientist Program in 1996 that supports a visiting scientist at the Center annually.  This dramatic increase in personnel has resulted in a diversification and enrichment of research and teaching, and a corresponding dramatic increase in undergraduate and graduate use of the Center.\r\n\r\nA remaining fundamental missing piece in the research and educational program at RTC is a facility to provide flowing seawater for care and experimental manipulation of estuarine and marine organisms.  Several RTC faculty and staff (4) have current NSF support for research projects that include aspects of experimental work on live organisms.  Other faculty and scientists have funding from DOE, NIH, and the California Department of Water Resources to conduct research which requires flowing bay or seawater.  San Francisco Bay Area collaborators have expressed strong interest in a facility with a state-of-the-art bay and seawater system for research, animal care and aquaculture located on San Francisco Bay.  The primary objective of this proposal is to create a modern seawater facility by providing the tanks, water tables, heating unit and a system of state-of-the-art computer hardware and software for precise control of the system.  This facility will support the numerous research and educational activities of internal RTC scientists and external local educators and scientists.\r\n\r\n",
