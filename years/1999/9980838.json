Many of the most interesting current problems in microbiology are related to the geometry and function of molecular and cellular structures. There is great controversy in the interpretation of measurements of protein folding and cellular adhesion, and also great opportunity for research based on new measurement approaches. Biological folding and adhesion problems may be viewed from a mechanical engineering perspective as a simple matter of forces and energies - all of which might be measured by direct mechanical means. Experimental matters are complicated by the small size of the forces at work in molecular biology - ranging from nano-Newtons to less than femto-Newtons. However, these are forces that can be measured with MEMS devices. We propose to look specifically at experiments to measure folding forces in ribosomal RNA, ligand receptor binding forces, and cellular adhesion forces. In each case, new micromechanical instrumentation will be designed and used to carry out these measurements. These experiments will provide new understanding of the mechanics, dynamics, and other characteristics of these fundamental biological interactions. Throughout this work, research will take place at the interface between engineering and biology, bringing excitement and expertise from both domains. Engineering students will learn about fundamental biological phenomena. Biology students will learn about the design and fabrication of MEMS structures for experiments. Together, they will design and carry out novel fundamental experiments and learn important engineering methods. Students emerging from this program will possess unique interdisciplinary skills suitable for leadership roles in the emerging area of \"BioEngineering\". Our primary goal for this program is to establish a world-leading program in the application of micromechanical structures for Biological measurements, and the world-leading source of young scientists trained in the issues and disciplines surrounding these experiments. \r\n\r\n",
