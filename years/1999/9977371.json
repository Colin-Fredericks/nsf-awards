 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nUniversity of Michigan \r\n\r\nThe University of Michigan VIGRE program aims to accelerate the evolution of an integrated program of education and research in the setting of a highly rated research program at a large state university with a long tradition of concern for education at all levels. In order to make maximal use of the great diversity of strengths and interests in our department, we have designed a decentralized program consisting of a network of interconnected smaller scale activities. Our plans are informed by the belief that close contact among different groups in the department- particularly with senior faculty-is the most effective catalyst for the intellectual and professional development of our students and junior colleagues, and we attempt to foster and maximize these contacts at all levels.  Our VIGRE program connects with and augments several existing departmental initiatives and activities, notably a new doctoral program in Applied and Interdisciplinary Mathematics, and flourishing actuarial and REU programs. \r\n\r\n At the undergraduate level, we plan first to extend and unify the existing REU program through the appointment of several REU Integrators to bring students together during the summer, and to provide greater opportunities for students to continue their projects during term time.  Extended possibilities for teaching apprenticeships and internships are also part of the program.\r\n\r\nAt the graduate level, our goal is to immerse students more quickly and fully in the mathematical culture of the department, and to expand their view of the mathematical profession. We intend to accomplish this through three mechanisms:  Pro-Seminars, Teaching or Research Apprenticeships, and Non-Traditional Experiences in Mathematics Communication, Teaching or Research.  The pro-seminars will involve informal weekly meetings of first and second year graduate students with a spectrum of senior faculty.  Incoming VIGRE Trainees will complete teaching or research apprenticeships, again overseen by senior faculty. The research apprenticeships will involve participating in integrated research groups consisting of students, postdocs and faculty working together on related problems with a common focus. Finally, advanced VIGRE Trainees will complete a non-traditional project in mathematical communication, teaching or research.  For example, students can fulfill this requirement by preparing a significant piece of written or oral mathematical exposition, or by serving as REU Integrators. We also intend to institute a weekly VIGRE seminar aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students.\r\nAt the postdoctoral level, VIGRE will enhance an already very active program of postdoctoral scholars in the department. Modest and varied teaching duties will give our junior colleagues experience in a variety of classroom situations, while leaving ample time to focus on research and to benefit maximally from the very active mathematical life of the department. VIGRE Fellows will participate in a series of Pro-Seminars, led by senior faculty, designed to help them \"learn the ropes\" of the profession. As a mechanism to help postdocs develop independent research programs, senior faculty will direct participating seminars focusing on open problems. \r\n\r\n",
