Unlike compound semiconductors, lacking a suitable barrier material for silicon has prevented silicon to play an important role in new quantum devices.  The discovery of epitaxial growth beyond an adsorbed disordered monolayer of oxygen has opened the door to a new type of superlattice, Si/O superlattice.  The previously observed electroluminescence originates from e-h recombination from holes generated by e-h pair generation in the deep depletion of the silicon substrate.  This proposed study involves the replacement of the Schottky barrier by p-n junction so that both electrons and holes are injected into the active Si/O superlattice region.  Moreover, pulsed operation and lifetime measurements will be carried out.  Therefore, the frequency response of the electro-luminescent LED can be established.  The potential impact of the project may serve as a quantum jump in the future silicon optoelectronic devices.\r\n",
