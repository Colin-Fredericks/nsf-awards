Specifically, it considers how the tribal court of Koyukuk, an Alaska Native village, negotiates competing sets of rights - children's rights and native rights - in its attempt to maintain autonomy in Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) cases.  ICWA, a 1978 federal statute, transferred jurisdiction of native child welfare cases to tribal courts, although the state of Alaska resists this transfer.  \r\n\r\nCombining concerns of indigenous identity, child welfare, and legal practice, this study will contribute to understandings of how changing concepts of cultural difference, embodied in law, impact the ways in which indigenous communities make claims about themselves. Spanning twelve months, the project will include archival research, court observations, and interviews collected in Koyukuk and Fairbanks.  Research will critically analyze tribal court practices within the context of state and federal actions.  This project seeks to understand how underlying notions of national and ethnic cultures shape court decisions and how the implementation of ICWA in Alaska creates a forum in which to argue about cultural difference and equality.  \r\n\r\n",
