This research will advance our understanding of how social capital affects the behavior of post-conflict migrants in a hinterland city of Mozambique.  Through the analysis of data produced by several social science methods, including participant observation, ethnographic and survey research, ethnographic decision tree modeling, status role inventory/pile sorting and ranking, social network analysis, cohort analysis and life histories, the student will test hypotheses about the ability of new social ties to ameliorate insecurity in war refugees, the nature of shared interests in creating social ties, and the role of kinship in recruitment to voluntary social organizations.  This research will provide valuable knowledge to planners faced with the task of dealing with masses of refugees from conflict zones in many parts of the world.  In addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important area of the world. \r\n\r\n",
