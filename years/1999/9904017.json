From the individual's point of view, these processes are automatic.  However, something is planning these very precise movements, and that something is a central pattern generator (CPG).\tA CPG is a neural circuit that drives a set of muscles to perform a motor task.  The output o the neural circuit is adaptively reconfigured to meet the needs of the situation at hand.  For example, depending upon the circumstances, a walk can change to a run, chewing can be modified to blowing bubbles, slow deep breaths may turn into gasps.  CPGs vary in size and complexity depending upon the motor behavior.  One CPG, the pyloric network, is a leading model system for understanding how neural components of the circuits generate rhythmic behaviors.  The motor task, the motor output, the neuronal components of the circuits, their interaction, and their modulation have been extremely well characterized in this system.  Previous work indicates that each of the neurons in the changing the phenotypes of these neurons.  The purpose of this grant is to examine the molecular mechanisms that establish and modulate the unique phenotypes; the idea being that this understanding will elucidate how the neurons can continuously adapt their properties to a changing environment.  Specifically this grant is concerned with defining the mechanisms responsible for the diversity and modulation of a single property found in all cells, the transient potassium current (A-current).  Each cell type has a unique A-current, despite the fact that the shal gene encodes the A-channels that mediate the A-current in every cell.  One mechanism that cold account for A-current diversity is differential, cell-specific protein interactions with the A-channel.  One protein that is known to interact with A-channels is eag.  In this grant the role of eag subunit interactions in creating A-current diversity is explored.\r\n",
