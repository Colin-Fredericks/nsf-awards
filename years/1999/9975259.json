An effective field theory developed under prior NSF support will be extended and applied in a systematic treatment of electronic systems with static impurities.  Specific systems of interest include magnets with impurities, superconductors, and doped.  The methodologies include the construction of effective field theories, renormalization group techniques, and many-perturbation theory. \r\n\r\nThe problem of strongly interacting electron systems is a major one in modern condensed physics. Researchers have discovered over the past few years that such fundamental issues as magnetism in metals are not understood at a fundamental level and that existing theoretical methods are not sufficient to gain a deep understanding of problem. This grant will look at a number of problems related to the central one of strongly interacting electron systems and use, and develop, a variety of powerful mathematical techniques in order to do this.   The results of this project will be useful to other scientists concerned with the electrical and magnetic properties of matter.\r\n\r\n",
