 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two-year standard award.  A workshop for grantees of the NSF Human Computer Interaction Program will be held in late February 1999.  The increased importance of a meeting of researchers in HCI is underscored by a recent report of the Presidential Information Technology Advisory Committee (  HYPERLINK http://www.ccic.gov/ac/interim/   http://www.ccic.gov/ac/interim/ ) which calls for significantly increased research efforts in this area.  Attendees of the prior grantees workshops consistently recount the enriching experiences they encountered.  The workshops allow researchers to broaden their perspectives, learn of related fields, and obtain an understanding of the implications of these areas to their own research.  The opportunities to build new collaborations about at these workshops.  The proposed agenda will be developed by a steering committee, with feedback from participants of last year's event.  Continuing with the mission adopted by the past workshops, the primary focus of the workshop will be to foster fruitful exchange of ideas and to simulate interaction among colleagues.  The workshop will produce an HTML document to be resident for a minimum of one year on the web, which will summarize the diverse projects supported by the program.\r\n\r\n",
