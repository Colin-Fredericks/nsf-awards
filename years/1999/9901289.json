The project will develop, publish and disseminate ten Math Packs or packages of activities.  The innovative, realistic materials will help parents do math throughout the day, and within the constraints of everyday life, with their elementary (K-5th grade) children while doing housework, shopping, and meal preparation.  With the aid of one of the project partners, Ceridian Performance Partners, a leading work-family provider of contract services to small businesses (representing six million workers), it is anticipated the packs will be distributed to between 50,000 and several million parents at their workplaces across the nation.\r\n\r\nThe final component of the project is a research-based evaluation which will provide data to understanding how children learn math, the role of including the parent, doing math activities informally in the home setting, the efficacy of the Math Packs, and the effectiveness of workplace distribution.",
