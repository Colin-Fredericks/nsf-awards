In a series of papers over the last five years or so, \r\nthe three authors of this proposal, together with a number of collaborators, \r\nembarked on a systematic study of the dependence of the spectrum of self-adjoint \r\nSturm-Liouville problems on the problem. This project is a natural\r\ncontinuation of the above work. It is planned to enlarge the class of self-adjoint\r\nproblems covered (e.g. by including the so called \"left-definite\" problems) and,\r\nespecially, extend the above work to the non-self-adjoint case. The latter case is\r\nformidable: there is no general theory that can be compared with the well developed\r\ntheory for the self-adjoint case. A new approach introduced by the authors for\r\nthe self-adjoint case, using tools from algebraic geometry, has yielded considerable\r\ninsight for this case and is expected to do so also for the non-self-adjoint case.\r\n\r\nGeneral description. Sturm-Liouville problems have a celebrated history dating back\r\nto the seminal papers of Sturm and Liouville in 1836-37. Thousands of papers have \r\nbeen written on these problems by mathematicians and by scientists, and engineers.\r\nYet the field is still intensely active today with dozens of papers published every year. \r\nThese problems have a wide range of applications in pure mathematics, applied \r\nmathematics, quantum mechanics, the sciences and engineering. For example, they \r\ncan be used to study the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, eddies in the atmosphere, \r\nneutron transport, etc. etc. The main purpose of this project is to study, both \r\nqualitatively and quantitatively, some major and difficult classes of such problems \r\nabout which little is known.\r\n",
