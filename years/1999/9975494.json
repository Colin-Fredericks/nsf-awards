 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Straub of Boston University is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in algorithms for enhanced sampling and global optimization.  Such algorithms have extensive applications in simulations involving biomolecules, low temperature clusters, and supercooled liquids.  The goal of this research is to develop search algorithms that can sample complex multidimensional potential energy surfaces efficiently.  Ideally such a technique would 1) isolate the thermodynamically important low lying energy basins, and 2) effectively sample those basins and move between them in a way that produces exact thermodynamic averages.  Two new algorithms are proposed.  The first involves a novel Monte Carlo method that allows long range moves between neighborhoods of low energy minima in a way that satisfies detailed balance.   The second algorithm involves the continued development of quantum mechanical annealing methods for global optimization.  This involves a reformulation of the Feynman path integral representation that uses an effective potential to allow enhanced sampling beyond that of the standard quantum delocalization.  A number of applications are proposed including: 1) the simulation of solvated peptides; 2) the computation of thermodynamic averages for low temperature molecular clusters; and 3) the evaluation of the mechanism for ligand rebinding in myoglobin.\r\n\r\nThe simulation of condensed matter systems has been moved forward by dramatic increases in the availability and speed of computers and the development of effective algorithms for the simulation of dynamical and thermodynamic phenomena.  Of particular fundamental and practical interest are the properties of biomolecular, supercooled and glass forming systems.  For such systems, the task of isolating conformations of lowest free energy or computing thermodynamic averages is frustrated by the rugged energy landscape.  The new techniques being developed by Straub should find widespread applications in the simulation of biological systems.",
