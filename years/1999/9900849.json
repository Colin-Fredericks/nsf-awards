 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States, Canada and Great Britain all liberalized their abortion laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but, in the process, these countries established markedly different abortion policies. Though these policies have changed over time, the differences have persisted. Abortion policies have also varied markedly among American states. This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the determinants of the character and timing of abortion policies. This includes an analysis of variation across the three nations and across American states. The analyses are based on theoretical models and conceptual schemes prominent in the cross-national literature on social policy. A synthetic model is offered which suggests that political actors are strongly bounded by the constitutional structures of their polity. Several comparative and quantitative strategies will be employed to appraise the theoretical models. First, the project will include comparative historical analyses of major national-level policy episodes in the United States, Canada and Great Britain. Second, it will contain comparative historical analyses of state-level abortion policy-making in four American states. Third, it will contain quantitative and event history analyses of abortion policies in the fifty American states. Finally, it will utilize Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to appraise combinational arguments.",
