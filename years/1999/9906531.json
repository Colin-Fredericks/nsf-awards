 "awd_abstract_narration": "9906531 Zeh      Discoveries in molecular biology are providing growing  evidence that the genomes of species are dynamic entities,  constantly evolving, at least in part, as a result of  genetic conflicts within and between the nucleus and the  cytoplasm. Selfish genetic elements, such as cellular  endosymbionts, transposable elements, segregation distorter  alleles, maternal effect lethal alleles, as well as  hyperavailable (\"junk\") DNA and imbalances in genomically-  imprinted genes, can all undermine female fitness by  rendering certain combinations of maternal and paternal  genotypes incompatible within the developing embryo.    The development of single-locus minisatellite DNA probes for  the pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides, in  combination with a mammalian-like viviparous reproductive  biology highly amenable to experimentation and involving the  production of large numbers of offspring, makes this species  a model system for investigating the effects of paternal  genotypes on female fitness. Through a research program  involving behavioral analyses, breeding experiments and DNA  profiling, this study will test the hypothesis that cellular  and molecular interactions within the female reproductive  tract can provide females with mechanisms for minimizing the  risk and/or cost of fertilization by genetically-  incompatible sperm. This genetic incompatibility hypothesis  will be tested against several previously proposed  hypotheses to explain how paternal genotypes can influence  female reproductive success, namely the trading-up  hypothesis, the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis and the  intrinsic male quality hypothesis.",
