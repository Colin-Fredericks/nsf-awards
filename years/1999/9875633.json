The research component of the project aims to develop a novel imaging analysis and modeling technique for trabecular bone mechanics.  Trabecular bone, a spongy, porous type of bone tissue made of tiny rods and plates, is mostly affected by many bone diseases such as osteoporosis, which costs billions of dollars in health care in the United States alone.  The complex three-dimensional microstructure of trabecular bone can be captured in great details by high resolution imaging techniques.  Mechanical models based on these high-resolution images of trabecular bone are very useful in determining mechanical properties of normal and diseased trabecular bone.  One technical challenge in modeling is to overcome the enormously large size of the models.  In this project, a distinctly new approach will be developed to handle microstructural modeling of trabecular bone.  We will develop imaging analysis procedures on high-resolution images of trabecular bone to create microstructural models with significantly reduced size (200-100 fold) such that even a whole bone can be analyzed!  In parallel with this research activity, a new course in computational biomechanics for senior undergraduate and first year graduate students will be introduced.  In this new course, we will use a multimedia teaching facility equipped with numerous computer workstations and video-audio aids to teach students the fundamentals in biology, computational techniques as well as basic principles of mechanics.  In addition, using the Internet as a fast channel for information dissemination, all teaching materials will be written in a highly graphical and multimedia format and placed on the World-Wide-Web for student's easy access.  Furthermore, programming modules of basic computational techniques will be written in a new Java language, which allow a computer-platform-independent Internet access by students.  New research advances in the research component will be introduced and implemented in the course.  In summary, this project will develop an innovative modeling technique for trabecular bone, integrate new research advances in undergraduate/graduate education, and provide an interactive (fun) teaching forum for enhancing education in science, mathematics, engineering and technology. \r\n\r\n",
