These photonic devices are critically important for optical fiber communication systems, optical computing , optical interconnects; data transmission and signal processing.  To exploit fully the potential of these technologically important materials, controllable doping is an obvious necessity.  Despite numerous experimental efforts made in recent years, there is still much controversy and mystery surrounding the identification and characterization of intrinsic defects, especially their association with compensation mechanisms in doped group III-nitrides.  Both hydrogen and native defects are known to play important role as compensating centers in GaN.  Infrared spectroscopy can provide information about the incorporation of hydrogen and/or intrinsic defects forming complexes with the dopants in n- and p-type materials.  In III-V semiconductors (e.g., GaAs), distinct vibrational modes observed earlier by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy provided invaluable information in establishing the site selectivity of amphoteric (e.g., silicon, carbon, etc.) impurities, and complex (e.g., SiGa- VGGa, BeGa,- AsGa, As-H etc.) defect centers.  By involving undergraduate students in this project, we will focus m three major tasks: (i) Identifying the presence of native defects and their interactions with impurities in n- and p-type GaN, A1N and AlxGa1-x,N alloys using local vibrational mode spectroscopy. (ii) Performing Group theory and realistic model calculations based m Green's function formalism to facilitate the FT-IR spectroscopic investigations. (iii) Studying the electronic properties of QWs, and SLs for device applications. ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
