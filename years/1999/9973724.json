This  will be an open international meeting devoted to the most recent advances in the rapidly evolving field of eucaryotic transcription.  Attendance will be limited only by the available facilities, which can accommodate a  maximum of 425 participants.  Oral presentations will be a combination of those invited and those selected from submitted abstracts.  This ensures the participation of junior and senior leaders in the field and the presentation of the most exciting results emerging at the time of the meeting.  The oral presentations will be complemented by poster presentations, also selected from submitted abstracts. The areas covered by the meeting include studies on 1) RNA polymerase, 2) global regulation, 3) chromatin remodelling and access to the template, 4) regulatory complexes, 5) gene-specific regulatory mechanisms, 6) activation mechanisms, 7) regulation of regulators, and 8) promoter clearance and elongation.  A number of eucaryotic systems including mammalian, Drosophila, nematode, and yeast will be represented.\r\n\r\nThe control of transcription is probably the most important step in the control of gene expression.  The understanding of how transcription is achieved and regulated is essential for understanding cell growth and differentiation, development, and cellular transformation.  This meeting will promote our understanding of this area by enabling its research community  to exchange and develop findings and ideas. \r\n\r\n",
