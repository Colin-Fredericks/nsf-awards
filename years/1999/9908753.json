 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and test pilot instructional software on CD-ROM and the Internet for female precollege students to foster the comprehension and appreciation of the intrinsic beauty and excitement of engineering as a human endeavor.  Six pilot modules will be developed, each covering a typical problem in engineering economy, fluid mechanics' system, rigid-body mechanics, circuit analysis, mechanics of materials, and thermodynamics.  Anthropomorphized machine parts and engineering formulas will interact with each other, guided by some of the world's greatest scientists.  Without advanced math and science prerequisites, students will learn about the recursive nature and the methodological uniformities in system identification, pattern analysis and synthesis, simultaneous conditions, engineering approximation, and the \"teamwork\" of these general methods in pursuing a high learning efficiency in fundamental engineering problem-solving.  Precollege teachers and counselors, recruited from northern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, eastern Iowa, and northern Indiana, will be trained to use the pilot modules and to develop similar modules in two teacher and counselor workshops.  Sixty female and sixty male precollege students will participate in a field test that will focus on the pedagogical effects of the multimedia series, recruited through the Rockford Public School District.  Pre- and post-tests will evaluate students' learning about fundamental engineering problem-solving and their general attitudes toward math, science, and engineering.  A comprehensive, independent evaluation will be conducted prior to national dissemination by an external evaluator.",
