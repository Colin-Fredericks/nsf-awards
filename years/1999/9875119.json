The research focuses on deformation mechanisms in thin metal films on substrates.  It is now recognized that the mechanical behavior of such films may be very different from that of the same metals in bulk form. The mechanical properties and the behavior of dislocations in thin metal films on substrates are examined in detail via a unique combination of efforts.  Stress measurements are conducted using a unique ultra-high-vacuum sputter deposition combined with a substrate curvature measurement system.  Advanced microstructural characterization is carried out using transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction methods.  Mechanical behavior and microstructure are simulated using finite element and discrete dislocation dynamics methods. By comparing the results of these efforts, detailed knowledge is generated on how microstructural and dimensional constraints on deformation lead to unique film behavior. The educational portion integrates a modern view of mechanical properties into the Cornell materials curriculum, bringing specialized knowledge regarding mechanical properties in small dimensions to individuals in both academe and industry.  Three courses in mechanical properties are planned: a broad introduction for undergraduates, a high level graduate level course, and a specialized course at the graduate level which focuses on aspects on mechanical properties specific to small dimensions.  Opportunities are offered for interested external learners to obtain up-to-date information regarding mechanical properties in small dimensions through a series of tutorials and an electronic course for remote learners.\r\n%%%\r\nThis detailed study of dislocation interactions and of dislocation behavior near film/substrate and film/passivation interfaces is important to understanding bulk behavior.  Since metal films on substrates are critical elements in a range of high-technology applications, the research should generate knowledge of immediate use to industry, in particular with respect to understanding and improving reliability in microelectronics, micromechanical and optical devices, and coatings.  \r\n***\r\n\r\n9875119\r\nBaker\r\n\r\nThis CAREER grant explores the special mechanical properties that arise in very small volumes and integrates it with a modern education program in the area of mechanical properties of materials.
