 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cross-Commodity Equilibrium Pricing: Theoretical Implications and Empirical Tests of Forward and Option Prices\r\n\r\nProject Abstract\r\n\r\nIn this project we are developing an equilibrium model of cross-commodity pricing in a setting in which one or more input commodities can be transformed (converted) into one or more output commodities.  This allows us to analyze the operational and physical options that emerge as a consequence of the ability to transform commodity products and determine their effect on equilibrium price processes.  Our framework extends single commodity models of the storage option and convenience yield to a general multicommodity framework that incorporates conversion as well as storage options.  The project offers contributions along several dimensions.  We show the existence and uniqueness of a \"well-behaved\" equilibrium with K commodities with costly storage and costly conversion in a flexible specification that includes as special cases (1) the use of alternative fuels to produce electricity (many inputs, one output), (2) the refinement of crude oil into alternative refined products such as jet fuel, gasoline or heating oil (one input, many outputs) and (3) the movement of a commodity over a geographic network.  The comparative statics properties of the model are analyzed.  The model delivers results that are consistent with the stylized facts in the market for electricity, including the behavior of the 'spark' spread between electricity and a storable potential fuel.  We will apply the model to additional substantive contexts and calibrate and test the model empirically to explore the ability of our cross-commodity restrictions and the conversion options to explain the dynamic features of pricing and hedging across commodities as well as the exercise of the associated physical options to store, refine and distribute commodities.\r\n\r\n",
