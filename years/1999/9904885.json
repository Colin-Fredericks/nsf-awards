 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\tThis project will investigate how aggressive (dominance) interactions among animal society members can influence coordination at the group level.  Social wasps are ideal subjects for this work, given their complex colonies and the ease with which one can experimentally manipulate their social structure. Dr. O'Donnell will assess how variation in physiology and genetic background lead to individual differences in dominance status among workers, and govern the development of dominance.  In addition he will experimentally alter colony conditions, and assess the role of dominance in maintaining efficient task performance at the colony level.\r\n\tAnimal societies of hundreds or more interacting individuals may be self-organizing entities. The society's labor force is non-hierarchically structured, and workers rely on communication with other workers to regulate their task-performance decisions. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of the regulation of division of labor in a well-studied, complex animal society. Furthermore, this research will yield general insight into how social coordination may be achieved in large, decentralized social groups. The proposed studies of social dominance will expand upon recent findings of physiological and genetic constraints on individual behavior, by examining the ways in  which an individuals' behavior may be integrated into a functioning colony.\r\n",
