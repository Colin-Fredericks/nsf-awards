 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875171  George Necula \r\nA major challenge in building software systems is to ensure that the various components fit together in a well-defined manner.  This problem is exacerbated by the recent advent of software components whose origin is unknown or inherently untrusted, such as mobile code or user extensions for operating system kernels or database servers.  Such system integrity and security problems are tackled using techniques from mathematical logic and programming language semantics, in the framework provided by Proof-Carrying Code.  As part of this research, the existing Proof-Carrying Code framework is extended to deal both with new language features such as objects, higher-order functions and copying garbage collection, and with more complex safety and liveness properties, such as information flow and resource usage constraints.  This requires the investigation of new formal reasoning systems that are capable of encoding the enriched safety  properties along with new proof methods to assist the generation of the safety proofs.\r\n",
