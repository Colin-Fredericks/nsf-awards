The program includes research and transfer to classroom activities.  During the first week there is group observation and study of local biological phenomena.  For the next four weeks teachers make observations of other phenomena on their own.  Scientists will serve as mentors during this time.  The sixth and final week is devoted to planning the use of the inquiry approach in the classroom. Teachers will communicate through an electronic \"chat room\" during the academic year to continue their interactions.  Research experiences are offered at five different sites throughout Florida over the five years of the project. \r\n",
