Eggers\r\nUniversity of Washington\r\n\r\nCISE Next Generation Software:  A Staged Compilation Architecture for Program Optimization\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is developing a more flexible model, called a staged compilation model, that allows interesting analysis and optimizations  to be performed at any of these three stages (and also at one or more library assembly stages between static compilation time and link time.)  Each stage performs the analyses and optimizations appropriate for its (partial) knowledge about the program, and produces as output partially-compiled code and analysis summary information for use by later stages.    Assignments of optimizations to later stages incur more compilation-time cost, but they present optimization opportunities not available at earlier stages.\r\n\r\nThe staged compilation model also includes the notion of staging individual optimizations.  A staged optimization is divided into two or more optimization stages, with the earlier optimization stages performing  preplanning and set-up work, and the final optimization stage completing the optimization.  Compared to a single-stage optimization, a mulit-stage optimization yields reduced compilation cost and/or increased optimization effectiveness:  by adding earlier preplanning stages to a single-stage optimization, some compilation work is moved to an earlier stage where it is cheaper.  Conversely, by adding later stages to a single-stage optimization, additional opportunities for optimization are exploited without repeating the entire analysis at the later stage.",
