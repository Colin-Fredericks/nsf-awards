 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine state level variations in the adoption, scope, and coverage of state building safety regulations and the factors that determine that variation.  The study will address two critical issues: the factors that account for variations in state adoption of building code regulations and what can be done to foster state adoption of hazard mitigation provisions of building code regulations.  Answers to the following questions will be sought: What is the impact of information provision strategies by federal agencies, model organizations and policy networks on state policy choices?  How do these exogenous factors relate to various sociopolitical and economic contextual factors at the state level.  A national, comparative analysis of all fifty states will be conducted, supplemented by case studies of four states: Florida, Texas, Oregon, and Idaho.  Data will be collected from secondary sources and from state officials, agencies, key stakeholder groups, and regional associations involved in regulation.  A survey of state officials will also be conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
