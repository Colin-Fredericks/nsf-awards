The project will examine how neo-liberal policies and changes in global agro-food systems are affecting food procurement and consumption practices among low income residents of Santiago, Dominican Republic.  Changing wage labor opportunities have fostered the growth of new residential communities in the urban region, far from the traditional markets. The student will study how residents of these neighborhoods  procure and consume nutritionally and culturally important foods.  Changes in the use of credit for food and in the degree of dependence on non-market foods will be analyzed.  Research will combine study of intra- and inter-household social relations with analysis of the larger processes that structure the flow of staple foods.  The project includes household surveys, in-depth household case studies, and tracking staple foods through consumption, distribution, to their source of production.  This research is important because it will advance our understanding of how changing global/national food systems impact local food procurement and consumption. The study will contribute important empirical data for policy-makers, urban planners, and social workers concerned about the urban poor in a global economy.  In addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important area of the world. \r\n",
