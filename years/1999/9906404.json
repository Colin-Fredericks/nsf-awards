Grace\r\nDevelopment and Evaluation of Innovative FRP Braided Fabric for Strengthening\r\nInfrastructures\r\n\r\nThe use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets and strips as strengthening\r\nmaterials for concrete structures has been gaining the interest of many\r\nresearchers and a few contractors during the last two decades. However, the\r\nlack of ductility in these materials and the corresponding catastrophic\r\nfailures of strengthened structures reported in several research investigations\r\nhave contributed to the lack of confidence in composite materials for\r\nstructural engineering and the subsequent delay in using them for the\r\nstrengthening/stiffening of concrete structures in the United States. It has\r\nbecome impossible to convince practicing structural engineers to recommend the\r\nuse of these materials to their clients. This is to be expected, since\r\nstructural engineers are very conservative and are accustomed to structures\r\nthat dissipate considerable energy before failure. Since ductility, combined\r\nwith the safety of occupants, is the basic ingredient of any successful\r\nstrengthening/stiffening project, only a handful of contractors has considered\r\nthe use of FRP materials. As a result, the use of currently available FRP\r\nmaterials in strengthening or stiffening applications in industrial facilities\r\nand highway bridges has been very limited in the United States.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, an innovative design of new FRP sheets needs to be\r\nintroduced and evaluated in both laboratory and field. This will require\r\nextensive collaboration among: (1) FRP fabricators (i.e., composite industry\r\nthat includes both producers of carbon, aramid, and glass fibers and epoxy\r\nadhesives), (2) contractors (construction industry), (3) academia, and (4) end\r\nusers (structural engineers). The proposed study will be conducted with\r\ncollaboration among Lawrence Technological University (LTU), DFI Pultruded\r\nComposites (DR), Baker Concrete Technologies Ind. (BCT), and Ohio Department of\r\nTransportation (ODOT).\r\n\r\nThe study will consist of four phases. The first phase will address the\r\ndevelopment of an innovative threeaxis braided FRP fabric that will be\r\nfabricated using a combination of carbon, aramid and glass fibers oriented in\r\nthree different directions. These sheets will differ from the currently\r\navailable, ineffective unidirectional and woven single fiber-type sheets, which\r\nhave been evaluated at LTU and found to lack the necessary energyabsorbing\r\ncapability. The developed fabrics will provide ductile rather than brittle\r\nfailure of strengthened structures. The interlocking mechanisms between the\r\nbraided carbon, aramid, and glass fibers in the three axes will ensure\r\nredistribution of the flexural and shear loads. This phase will also include\r\nthe determination and optimization of the mechanical properties of the braided\r\nsheets and a selected epoxy adhesive. This phase will be completed by DFI and\r\nLTU.\r\n\r\nThe second phase will deal with the construction, instrumentation and\r\nstrengthening of simple, continuous, and cantilever test beams. The developed\r\nFRP braided fabric and the selected epoxy adhesive will be used for\r\nstrengthening these beams. This phase will be completed by collaboration\r\nbetween the FRP producer, LTU, and the contractor. In the third phase, the\r\nstrengthened test beams will be transported to the Structural Testing Center\r\n(STC) at LTU and the research team will conduct various environmental/loading\r\ntests. During phase four, results from the first three phases will be deployed\r\ninto a practical application in the state of Ohio by ODOT.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration will be extended to teaching and seminar activities. The FRP\r\nproducer, strengthening contractor, and state engineers will be guest lecturers\r\nat LTU. The university research team and the industrial partners will provide\r\nseminars at the annual meetings of the Associated General Contractors of\r\nAmerica (AGC) and at meetings of the Great Lakes DOTs Consortium. Collaboration\r\nbetween university and industry will result in the development of an innovative\r\nFRP material for strengthening deficient concrete structures. The level of\r\nconfidence achieved by these activities win lead to the widespread use of this\r\nstateofthe art technology.",
