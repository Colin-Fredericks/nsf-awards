 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic Freight and Fleet Management: Modeling, Algorithm Development and Implementation\r\n\r\nThe proposed project involves the development of an integrated research and teaching program.  Its educational aim is to define the goals of a graduate program in transportation systems engineering (systems analysis and applied operations research) which includes a significant logistics component, to create a graduate sequence in freight network analysis and logistics and to guide the development of a four course undergraduate sequence in computer and mathematical methods for Civil and Environmental Engineering.  \r\n\r\nThe research focus is in the area of dynamic freight and fleet management. Commercial vehicle operations are increasingly dominated by operations which require that decisions be made in real-time, as changes in customer demands, traffic network conditions, and the availability of resources (vehicles, drivers, repair equipment, etc.) occur.  The rapid development of advanced information technologies suitable for use in real-time operations has outpaced the development of algorithms and implementable systems to support dynamic fleet management.  The proposed research involves algorithm development aimed specifically at time-constrained and stochastic fleet and freight management systems coupled with modeling efforts which focus on the representation of freight transportation networks with a sufficient degree of operational realism in order to draw reasonable inferences into the likelihood of successful implementation of the algorithms developed. Applications include trucking operations, (long haul truckload, less-than-truckload and intermodal drayage between maritime ports, railheads and air freight terminals), local package pickup and delivery operations and urban service fleets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
