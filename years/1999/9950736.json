 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop, test and evaluate a set of web-based modules to be used as the required reading for an interdisciplinary course, Introduction to Cognitive Science (PSYC/CSCI 3126). This set of modules are expected to have national impact.  The modules are to include textual material and interactive exercises designed to introduce upper division students to core topics in this discipline. A project team comprised of faculty from computer science, psychology, philosophy, and linguistics are leading the development and enhancement of the materials during the summer. In subsequent fall and spring semesters, the materials are to be tested and reviewed by faculty who teach a cognitive science course at other institutions. Final evaluation is to occur during the spring semester 2001 when the Web-based modules are to be required reading for students enrolled in Introduction to Cognitive Science. Upon completion of the project, the modules are to be freely available on the Internet and are to be maintained by course instructors.  It is anticipated that the maintenance effort can be funded through institution granting mechanisms. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
