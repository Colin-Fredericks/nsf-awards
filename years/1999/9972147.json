 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ewing\r\n9972147\r\n     Complex physical phenomena involving multiphase contaminant\r\nflows and transport in porous media are often modeled by coupled\r\nsystems of nonlinear partial differential equations.  Recent\r\nadvances in computational capabilities (particularly with the\r\nadvent of new parallel architectures) have greatly expanded the\r\npotential for incorporating more physics into the differential\r\nequations.  While such changes to the model can increase its\r\nability to represent accurately the underlying real process, this\r\nmust be verified in each phase of the modeling process utilizing\r\nphysical, mathematical, numerical, and computational concepts.\r\nThe investigator and his colleague develop analytical and\r\nnumerical methods for the differential equations describing\r\nmultiphase contaminant flows and transport in porous media.  The\r\nfirst objective is a theoretical analysis of these nonlinear\r\npartial differential equations.  Special topics to be treated are\r\nregularity, stability, and bifurcation phenomena.  The second\r\nobjective is to study and develop finite element methods capable\r\nof capturing sharp solution fronts, producing accurate fluid\r\nvelocities, conserving mass, giving high-order approximations in\r\ntime, and being efficiently adapted in local grid refinement.\r\nHere the investigators develop finite element methods for\r\ntreating systems of nonlinear transport-diffusion equations via\r\nconcepts of Eulerian-Lagrangian localized adjoint methods and\r\nmixed finite element methods coupled with high-order\r\ntime-stepping procedures.  The third objective is to develop\r\nefficient parallelizable iterative solution techniques for the\r\nresulting discrete problems.\r\n     This project continues ongoing development of accurate\r\nnumerical techniques, efficient computational codes, and\r\nsupporting mathematical analysis for modeling of multiphase flows\r\nand transport in groundwater hydrology that has applications in\r\ndesign of remediation and clean-up technologies.  The development\r\nof improved methods for assessing groundwater contamination by\r\nhazardous wastes has become increasingly important.  Indeed,\r\ngroundwater supplies are increasingly threatened by organic,\r\ninorganic, and radioactive contaminants introduced into the\r\nenvironment by improper disposal or accidental release.  Estimates\r\nof remediation costs at U.S. government sites alone range into\r\nthe hundreds of billions of dollars.  Protecting the quality of\r\ngroundwater supplies is a grand challenge problem of broad\r\nsocietal importance.  There are also a number of industrial\r\napplications of the proposed research.  The production and\r\nmanagment of oil reservoirs are governed by equations and\r\ntechnologies that are nearly identical to those exploited in\r\ngroundwater hydrology.  The manufacture of high quality fiber\r\nreinforced plastic composites for automotive and aerospace\r\napplication is controlled by technology similar to that studied\r\nin this project.  Design of semiconductors uses equations very\r\nanalogous to those for groundwater transport.  In these areas,\r\ntechnology transfer can be easily carried out.  In particular,\r\nbecause of their intellectual content and strong links to\r\nindustry, this variety of problems provides an excellent vehicle\r\nfor students to learn techniques in applied and computational\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\n",
