 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on new information about cognitive development in mathematical thinking, the mathematics department at Columbia College is developing a curriculum for developmental algebra, which incorporates handheld computer algebra systems (CAS). Careful attention is paid to building on students' intuitive understanding of mathematical principles; algebraic manipulative and writing are used to help students acquire an understanding of underlying concepts; symbolic algorithms are explored and practiced; and the handheld CAS is employed to facilitate the symbolic computations. The text has been tested extensively on the campus of Columbia College and is currently being tested at four other colleges in South Carolina. All indications are that the new approach is successful in significantly improving the student's attitudes toward mathematics, ability to succeed in courses beyond the developmental level and persistence in mathematics related study. This project has received the 1998 International Conference on Technology in Collegiate Mathematics Award for innovation and excellence in using technology to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that this project will result in a commercial product and national classroom testing of this new approach.\r\n",
