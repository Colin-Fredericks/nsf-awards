 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most fundamental problems in visual perception and cognition is\r\ninformation overload.  Given limited processing capacity, there's simply\r\ntoo much perceptual information competing for the control of thought and\r\naction.  Hence, observers must use selective attention to rapidly\r\nprioritize which aspects of a complex scene are most relevant to behavior.\r\nFor instance, drivers must be able to efficiently locate and identify\r\ntraffic signals and stop signs amidst a dizzying mosaic of visual\r\ninformation. People are highly adept at this, while artificial systems are\r\nnot.  This is because human observers employ powerful top-down knowledge\r\nto guide their perceptual interactions with the complex environment.\r\nTop-down knowledge is useful because the visual world is highly\r\nstructured.  For example, spatial layout of landmarks are relatively\r\nstable, certain objects tend to covary with others (toasters with ovens,\r\ndesks with lamps, etc.), and even moving objects such as cars tend to move\r\naround in systematic, predictable ways.   Sensitivity to this structure,\r\npresented to observers in the form of global visual context, provides\r\nuseful constraints on visual processing.  Importantly, this contextual\r\ninformation must be \"learned\" by perceivers.  Thus, the goal of this\r\nproject is to establish the importance of contextual information and\r\nlearning mechanisms in object recognition and visual search.  The first\r\nset of studies examines how visual contexts are defined, how contextual\r\ninformation is learned and represented, and how learned information is\r\napplied to new instances.  The second set of studies examines how temporal\r\ncontext information influences visual processing, and whether learning\r\naffects other visual processes such as the ability to segregate figure\r\nfrom ground. Successful completion of these studies will provide important\r\ninsights into top-down processing and learning mechanisms in human vision.\r\nThis understanding will be applicable to the design of more effective\r\nartificial systems, enabling these to benefit from perceptual experience\r\nas people do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
