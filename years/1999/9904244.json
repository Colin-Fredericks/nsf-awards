The student will study mosque construction in neighborhoods of Lahore, Pakistan, examining the role state planning has played in promoting urban mosques, and the religious-political controversies over building practices and mosque architecture.  The student will conduct an archival study of mosque construction since 1947, a survey of new mosques in planned urban neighborhoods, and an ethnographic study of mosques in various neighborhoods of the city, to show how people understand and act upon ideological debates and conflicts over Muslim citizenship. This research will advance our understanding of how diverse sects of Muslims interpret their religion through the central site of their practice, the mosque.  This understanding will be relevant to understanding Muslim culture in other countries, as well as be pertinent to understand the forms of religious-ethnic conflict in other societies.  In addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important area of the world. \r\n\r\n",
