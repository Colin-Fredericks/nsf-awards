Powerful high-speed optical probes  based on polarimetry will be developed to enable full characterization of the polarization state of light reflected from the surfaces of growing films with sub-monolayer resolution. The new methods will yield 1) the Stokes vector of the reflected light beam from 1.5 to 6.5 eV in 32 msec, or 2) the 16 elements of the Mueller matrix of the sample over a similar energy range in approximately 200 msec.  With such capabilities, a better understanding of the growth of silicon and  boron nitride thin films will be possible,  particularly throughout the technologically important deposition regimes in which the morphology or crystalline phase of the films evolves with thickness leading to anisotropy and depolarization effects. These methods  will guide the fabrication of new and improved thin film materials for use in future generation of large area electronics and hard coatings.   Technology transfer of the process of materials preparation is expected to lead in improvements in silicon thin film voltaics and boron nitride hard coatings technologies.  The proposed research will serve to train graduate and undergraduate students  with broad skills in condensed matter, materials, and optical physics that are in demand for post-graduate employment in industrial research and development laboratories.\r\n%%%\r\nIn this project the principal investigator will develop new techniques for the preparation of improved thin films during their growth on a variety of substrates.  The new methods will be transferable to U.S. industries engaged in the commercial production of thin films for a variety of technological applications.  The research will engage graduate and undergraduate students who will be trained in methods and techniques which will be important in U.S. technology in the 21st Century  \r\n***\r\n",
