 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goals of this CAREER project are to advance fundamental knowledge leading to higher productivity of ceramics grinding and to improve the problem solving abilities of undergraduate and graduate students.  The superior properties of ceramics make them a desirable material for many applications.  However, the fabrication cost of ceramic components is often prohibitive.  One of the problems occurs in the grinding of ceramics, where the rapid degradation of the grinding wheel hinders surface quality and production rate.  The research objectives of this project are to improve grinding wheel effectiveness through the use of high-frequency vibrations as a means of in-process cleaning of the wheel; and, the use of an abrasive waterjet as an in-process cleaning and dressing technique.   Both analysis and experimentation will be used to evaluate the effect of high-frequency vibrations on the performance of individual grains as well as the grinding wheel.  In addition, the interaction between a high-pressure waterjet (with and without entrained abrasive) and a grinding wheel will be investigated.  The education part of this project will introduce problem-based learning concepts in the classroom.  Techniques for solving open-ended practical problems will be introduced in an undergraduate class, and experimental exercises will be developed in a problem-solving project course for graduate students.\r\n     The potential impact of the project includes improved methods for fracture-free grinding of ceramics, new scientific knowledge on the effect of high-frequency vibrations on the grinding process as well as on the interaction between a high-pressure waterjet and a grinding wheel, and the education of undergraduate and graduate students in practical problem solving.\r\n",
