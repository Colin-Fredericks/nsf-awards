Wieman, Department of Physics and JILA (Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics), University of Colorado, to pursue with Dr. Donghyun Cho, Department of Physics, Korea University, for 24 months, a program of cooperative research involving construction and use of an optical trap based on the theory of the analogous Zeeman effect.  According to the theory, when the laser light is circularly polarized and properly detuned, it can induce an AC Stark shift that is in the form of a pure Zeeman shift.  An optical trap built in this way will behave like a magnetic trap except without the troublesome magnetic field gradient.  It will hold a spin-polarized sample of atoms that will be useful in many areas of physics.  The collaborators will develop ways to load atoms from a magneto optical trap to such an optical trap efficiently, and also plan to study spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties of trapped atoms.  They also will study properties of an optical trap built with circularly polarized light in general to find a new cooling scheme in such a trap.  Specifically, they plan to use the tensor polarizability of an atom to develop a Sisyphus cooling mechanism.  This will have implications in achieving Bose-Einstein condensation in an optical trap.\r\n\r\nThis project will strengthen. collaboration between highly respected U.S. and Korean research teams and will provide an international research experience for a U.S. graduate student.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
