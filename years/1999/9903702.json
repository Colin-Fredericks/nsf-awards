 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI project represents a collaborative effort between researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, SUNY (Stony Brook), and Cape Simulations Inc., together with crystal growth companies: Cree Research, Inc., Epitronics, Inc., Northrop Grumman Corp., Airtron-Litton Corp., and II-VI, Inc. to investigate nucleation mechanisms of crystalline defects in SiC. The objectives of the project are to advance the understanding of processes responsible for nucleation and evolution of extended defects in SiC boules. In particular basal plane and screw dislocations, stacking faults, micropipes, and low angle domain boundaries will be investigated. The approach consists of three thrusts:(i) Modeling of silicon carbide Physical Vapor Transport growth with emphasis on thermoelastic stresses at different stages of growth. Local stress fields around small second phase inclusions common in PVT growth will also be modeled. (ii) SiC PVT growth experiments will be performed in a small scale PVT system in carefully optimized conditions selected to minimize defect nucleation. Critical process parameters will be adjusted to test models of defect nucleation and multiplication. Growth will be interrupted at different stages (in particular early seeding stages), followed by ex situ structural characterization. (iii) Structural characterization of SiC crystals will be performed by synchrotron white beam x-ray topography (SWBXT), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy, etching and high resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD). Density of basal plane dislocations and total bending of basal plane will be determined and correlated with macroscopic stress distributions. Nucleation of screw dislocations at early stages of growth and their association with stacking disorder and inclusions will be observed by x-ray topography and TEM. Misorientation components across low angle grain boundaries revealed by etching will be measured by HRXRD and their origin interpreted.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to bulk crystal growth important to electronics/photonics. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the cost, perform-ance and stability of advanced devices.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. Graduate students participating in this project will gain multifaceted experience collaborating with team members. They will work with and improve process simulation tools, grow and characterize SiC crystals, take part in technology transfer, and will be exposed to work in both academic and industrial environments. The project is co-supported by the DMR/Electronic Materials program and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).\r\n***\r\n",
