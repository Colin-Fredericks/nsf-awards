 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nA new site-specific insertion procedure will be used to study the phenotypic effects and fitness consequences of a male reproductive gene, Acp26Aa, of Drosophila melanogaster. The product of Acp26Aa is a protein that is transferred from males to females during mating. Recent studies have shown that Acp26Aa has evolved at a very high rate that is achievable only through positive directional selection. By inserting different alleles into the same genomic site, competing hypotheses concerning the action of selection can be tested. The allelic comparisons will be between the wildtype and a null allele, between alleles of different species and, most interestingly, between the inferred ancestral type and a common allele that has replaced it in nature. Various phenotypic differences (egg-laying, sperm utilization, sperm competition, etc.) will be measured in order to gain insight into the mechanisms of selection and to test the hypotheses that sexual selection, which drives the evolution of Acp26Aa is in the form of 1) male-female cooperation, 2) male- female antagonism or 3) male-male competition. The various phenotypic measurements affecting fitness will also be tested in toto in long term-population cages.  A population genetic survey of DNA variation of Acp26Aa in D. mauritiana will be done. Since prior evidence suggests that D. mauritiana has experienced stronger sexual selection than its sibling species, it is hypothesized that the signature of positive selection will be exaggerated at the Acp26Aa locus of this species.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect of evolution is the substitution of new and better genes or alleles for the old ones in the population. How that process of natural sexual selection takes place for any given gene is central to our understanding of evolution. To understand the mechanisms by which the inferred selection operates would require experimental assays that compare different alleles at an identical site in an identical genetic background and that has recently been made possible in Drosophila melanogaster by new technological developments. In the last decade, several lines of evidence have shown that many genes pertaining to male reproduction are evolving at an unusually high rate. An important reason for this rapid evolution may be the intense selective pressure on males' reproductive performance which, unlike females' can vary greatly from male to male. It is an opportune time to introduce molecular technology to study this most classical and fascinating question\r\n",
