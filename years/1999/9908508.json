A summer engineering program for 9th and 10th graders initiated by Dr. Deutschman in 1970 has run continuously for twenty-nine years.  He has mentored over 2,500 students averaging 100 students per year. These students have been predominately underrepresented minority students from the Greater Newark area.  Over 95% of Dr. Deutschman's mentees have enrolled in college and 70% have majored in science, mathematics or engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
