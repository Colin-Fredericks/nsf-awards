 "awd_abstract_narration": "Entrepreneurial networks are social interconnections among entrepreneurs participating in a given economic activity.  These networks can accelerate the transmission of information, facilitate innovation, and enhance systems of mutual assistance, although they can also limit access to new information or discourage learning if participation is dependent on specific characteristics like ethnicity or religion, if the network hierarchy is vertical, or if contacts are limited to a small, highly cohesive group.  By analyzing entrepreneurial networks, geographers and other social scientists obtain new insights into the cultural, political, and social contexts of economic systems and economic development.  This doctoral dissertation research project will use case studies of two entrepreneurial networks in and around Mwanza in northern Tanzania to characterize the conventions shaping interactions within the networks; to identify the bases of legitimacy affecting who participates in the network; to determine the importance of these networks for entrepreneurial innovation; to assess the levels of trust influencing the depth of relationships in the network; and to correlate business performance with network participation.  In-depth, semi-standardized interviews will be conducted with entrepreneurs in each network and field observations will be made of their business practices.  Statistical correlations will test the significance of relationships among enterprise, entrepreneur, and network characteristics, firm performance, and firm innovation, while qualitative analyses will detail significant social, cultural, political, and external influences on the networks and social relationships between entrepreneurs.  This research will increase knowledge of how small enterprise entrepreneurial networks relate to Tanzanian society and what role they have played in the success of economic development policies.  Beyond the Tanzanian context, the project will contribute to understandings of the potential for independent development in sub-Saharan Africa and will enhance insights into the role of social institutions in economic transformations.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
