 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will visit the University of Texas for the spring semester of 2000 to work with Professor Alan Reid.   The goal is to study the structure of three dimensional hyperbolic manifolds from an algebraic point of view.  In particular,  the investigator will study subgroup separability of Kleinian groups, and\r\narithmetic of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.\r\n\r\nThe determination of whether a subgroup H is separable in a group G has applications in group\r\ntheory and geometric topology.  In group theory, it is linked to the solution of generalized word problems.  In geometric topology, it is the traditional group-theoretic tool used to decide if a given immersion in a manifold M will lift to an embedding in a finite covering of M.  The investigator plans to continue her research on\r\nsubgroup separability of Kleinian groups.  She will consider whether or not two generator subgroups and quasi-Fuchsian subgroups are separable in finite covolume Kleinian groups.  These are steps towards the\r\nsolution of an important unsolved problem in 3-manifolds, namely the determination of what subgroups of fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds are separable.\r\n  \r\nAlgebraic number theory is integral to the study of hyperbolic manifolds.  For example, an arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold is completely determined, up to commensurability, by its defining number field k and quaternion algebra A.  Moreover, the volume of an arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifold is a function of arithmetic invariants associated to k and A.  The investigator will begin a research program\r\nin this area, after studying with Professor Reid.  In particular, she will study the precise relationship\r\nbetween the geometric structure of a hyperbolic 3-manifold and arithmetic properties of the associated number field and quaternion algebra.  This POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
