 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWe propose to identify factors that encourage SMET graduate students' participatioon in K-12 education and outreach, to provide opportunities for students that circumvent systemic barriers to participation, and to evaluate to potential benefits of this experience as a component of graduate education.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have much anecdotal information about factors that discourage student involvement, including advisors' attitudes, time pressures, and student attitudes about the value of such experience in obtaining future jobs.  However, we do not have quantitative information about the relative importance of these and other factors.\r\n\r\nThis research builds on Dr. Andrew's experience as a PFSMETE fellow, takes advantage of  her position within a research university and a scientific research laboratory.  It addresses a well-defined question that has potentially important answers, and may lead to significant research in subsequent years.  The proposed plan also provides significant opportunities for Dr. Andrews' professional development as a science educator.",
