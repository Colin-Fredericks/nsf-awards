 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA four-year plan to enhance astronomical research and teaching at the University of Illinois and throughout the world will be carried out.  The research capitalizes on obtaining new astronomical data optimized for detection of low surface brightness emissions from the Milky Way Galaxy.  The research and the teaching activities will take advantage of the new technologies that are available by using robotic telescopes and the World Wide Web (WWW, \"the Web\").\r\n\r\nThe focus of the research activity is on the faint interstellar medium of the Milky Way. A definitive atlas of the entire sky, observed at the Hydrogen alpha (H-alpha) emission line, will be produced that will be 30 times more sensitive than previous surveys in this area.  This new sky atlas will reveal hundreds of new objects, which may then be studied further.  Numerous sources of ionization in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way will be identified and specific ones will be studied in depth with spectroscopy.   Because of the direct physical relationship of the H-alpha emission and the free-free emission in the Milky Way, the H-alpha emission is a sensitive tracer of free-free emission in the Milky Way.  The H-alpha data will permit the removal of contamination of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data by the Milky Way emissions.  The data Milky Way observations will be used to improve the analysis of the data from the MAP and PLANCK satellite missions to observe the CMB.   The decontamination will improve the credibility and the sensitivity of the satellite CMB results by allowing spurious signals to be eliminated from the data.  The combination of the availability of the H-alpha data and CMB microwave data will allow the measurement of the electron temperature of the warm ionized medium over the entire sky.  The results of the data analysis will be used to test new theories for microwave emissions from spinning, charged dust grains that are in the interstellar medium.\r\n\r\nThe research activities will be integrated into education activities by using the \"Stardial\".  The Stardial is an autonomous robotic astronomical camera system that produces images of the night sky.  The system was invented specifically to be used for teaching astronomy via the Web.  The Stardial supplies small telescope observational capabilities to anyone with access to a \"WWW\" browser.  One objective of this award is to expand the Stardial project to other universities and high schools and to extend the technique so that it may be used on other telescopes.   The Stardial program has already been involved in carrying out two years of continuous monitoring of the night sky, and at least three universities and one high school have used it.  The use of the Stardial project will be extended by linking it to existing robotic telescopes via the Web.   Software for the Web-interface will be written and collaborators with hardware will be solicited, i.e. those with robotic telescopes, to be involved in the Stardial activity.  The Web-based interface will provide simple, reliable, and cost-effective access to robotic telescopes to obtain data that may be used for both teaching and research.  There will be a software program that will simulate the operation of the each telescope to allow the user to practice prior to using the actual telescope.   The interface also will allow the inclusion of human-operated telescopes.   Successful teaching activities related to variable stars and asteroids have been developed and these activities will be extended and distributed on the Web.\r\n***\r\n",
