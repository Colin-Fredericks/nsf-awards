In many applications, a distributed system is required to \r\nstage a spontaneous run-time recovery from failures of an unforeseen nature, \r\nor from environmental perturbations. The design of such systems, known as \r\nself-stabilizing systems or simply stabilizing systems, has been\r\nextensively studied in recent years. \r\n\r\nA major weakness in current stabilizing distributed systems is their \r\ninability to correlate the recovery time with the extent of failure.  A \r\nsecond concern is the potential of non-faulty processes being contaminated \r\nduring the recovery phase, a problem that may have alarming consequences \r\nwith the rapid proliferation of large distributed systems. This motivates \r\nthe study of controlled recovery in distributed systems, where control\r\nimplies that certain performance constraints are satisfied during recovery.\r\nThe study of controlled recovery will lead to a better understanding\r\nof the design of safety-critical systems. In addition to studying\r\nthe algorithmic foundations of the design of such systems, applications \r\nin the areas of multimedia data routing and ad-hoc networks of mobile\r\nnodes will be examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
