Responses of both quantum and classical multi-stable systems to an alternating field are expected to display dramatically strong nonlinearity, even for comparatively weak fields. The present investigation examines this response over a wide spectral range, from frequencies of order of the rates of interstate transitions up to the characteristic intra-well frequencies of the trapped particle. The effect of a high-frequency field on the rates of activated transitions is largely unexplored, and it is in this range that the most striking, selective control over particulate motion can be exercised. Two classes of experiments, with closely coupled theoretical elaboration, are chosen to demonstrate these and related phenomena. They include inter-well transitions of classical particles in a driven optical trap using optical \"tweezers\", and the quantum tunneling of hydrogen in disordered metals probed by large amplitude ultrasonic fields.\r\n%%%\r\nThe goal of this research program is to explore, by experiment and by theory, the effects of time-dependent fields on the motion of particles trapped in double, or multiple, potential wells, and to establish ways of controlling this motion. The investigation examines this response over a wide spectral range, from frequencies of order of the rates of interstate transitions up to the characteristic intra-well frequencies of the trapped particle. Although fundamental, the ideas and methods can result in practical consequences for several areas of applied science and technology. One of the most exciting occurs in control of nonequilibrium crystal growth, where surface diffusion plays a crucial role. The degradation of electronic and optical components, brought about by defect and impurity migration in the presence of large amplitude oscillating fields, is another. Also, chemical and biological separation, an area of immense growth, depends upon discriminating among species diffusing in strong fields and field gradients. This research explicitly includes both graduate and undergraduate participation in both experimental and theoretical aspects. \r\n",
