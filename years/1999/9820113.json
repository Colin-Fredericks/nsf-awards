However, because of previous technological limitations, investigations of the mechanical behavior of whole cells have been of only a limited nature.  The goal of this pilot experiment is to develop a collaboration between a group of investigators with expertise in biomechanics, Micro-Electro-Mechanical- Systems (MEMS), and cell biology, in order to initiate development of a new class of cell testing devices.  MEMS technology is a branch of engineering that is focused on development of machines that operate at the scale of microns. This new \"Bio-MEMS\" device will enable characterization of the mechanical behavior of individual live cells, for static compressive loads, and ultimately, for more complex loading.  This work is significant in that it will provide the basis for continued developmental work on such devices, collection of important preliminary data for support of further research on a larger scale, and will establish a close collaboration between an unique set of faculty with a common interest in tissue engineering. \r\n\r\n",
