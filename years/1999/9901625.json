 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses details of bonding and passivation activity of H in semiconductors using vibrational spectroscopy at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure in conjunction with vibrational spectroscopy will be used to provide new information and understanding of several hydrogen-containing defect complexes in compound semiconductor materials. The pressure dependence of C-H stretch modes in InP and GaP will be measured and compared to GaAs. Pressure-induced shifts of  local vibrational mode (LVM) frequencies are strongly dependent on the local environment of the hydrogen atom. In the GaN:Mg,H complex, these experiments will attempt to distinguish between bond-centered and antibonding N-H configurations. Local vibrational modes of S-H complexes in GaSb will also be investigated. Hall effect measurements will be used in the study before and after annealing materials to determine mobility and concentration of free carriers. \r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level which will be relevant to performance of advanced electronic devices/circuits. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.  \r\n***\r\n",
