 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for partial support of the Annual Meeting of the Society for Developmental Biology over the next two years (1999-2000).  The Society has sponsored this annual meeting for 57 years (only missing two years during WW II), reflecting the long-term interest in this topic, as well as SDB's commitment to keep up the scientific quality of the meeting.  In the last few years the meeting and its importance in the community has grown so that last year's meeting in Stanford attracted more than 800 people.  The upcoming 58th Annual meeting will be held at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville from June 13-18, 1999.  We expect 600-800 registrants to attend and have the opportunity to hear the latest work from international leaders, as well as from younger scientist who are making exciting contributions to the field.  Fifty-five invited speakers will speak on topics including Morphogenesis and Cell Fate, Signals that Organize the Body Plan, Evolution of the Body Plan, Genetics and Development, Gametogenesis and Germ Line Development, The Cell Biology of Development, Cell Lineage and Cell Polarity, Wiring the Nervous System and Embryonic Patterning.  An additional 30 speakers will be chosen from submitted abstracts, allowing the inclusion of the most up-to-the-minute results and providing the opportunity for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to talk about their work.  The afternoons will be devoted to poster sessions and workshops.  A special education symposium will address issues for teachers and for those interested in presenting science to the broader community.  In all the scientific sessions work on diverse organisms including invertebrates, vertebrates and plants will be presented.  We expect to continue to emphasize the best science, to bring together senior and junior investigators interested in developmental biology and to provide the forum for exchange of ideas on science, education and on the role of science in the society.\r\n\r\n",
