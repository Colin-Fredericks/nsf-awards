 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although spatial cognition has been studied in a variety of domains,\r\nthere is still little known about the integration of spatial skills in\r\nsolving complex problems.  In this research program, virtual\r\nenvironment technology (VET) will be used to study complex spatial\r\nskills and, from the results of this study, to develop effective\r\nvirtual environments to train these skills.  With their interactive\r\nand compelling nature, virtual environments can become an essential\r\ntool for training, visualization, planning, and communication in an\r\nunlimited variety of applications.  But if VET is to reach its\r\npotential, there must be a better understanding of how humans acquire\r\nand integrate multi-sensory information in three-dimensional space.\r\n\r\nThe focus application of the work will be surgical training, which\r\nprovides a challenging environment for studying spatial cognition.\r\nThe performance of surgical tasks requires a broad range of spatial\r\nprocesses in order to plan, navigate, and reason using complex\r\nrepresentations of space.  The surgeon must develop a mental image of\r\nthree-dimensional anatomy based on a surface view or cross sections\r\nfrom X-ray, CT, MRI, or ultrasound images.  From this model and a goal\r\nstate based on experience and anatomical knowledge, he or she must\r\nplan a strategy to gain exposure of the important anatomy and obtain\r\nthe desired result.  With the advent of minimally invasive techniques,\r\nthe surgeon relies on a video image of the internal anatomy and use\r\ninstruments constrained by a fulcrum at their passage through the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThis work has two synergistic thrusts.  The first aims to advance\r\nfundamental knowledge in cognitive science by examining how spatial\r\ncognitive skills are integrated in the performance of complex tasks.\r\nSpecifically, the project will study navigation in small-scale\r\nthree-dimensional environments, mental simulation of mechanical\r\ninteractions between deformable structures, and how these spatial and\r\nmechanical reasoning processes are integrated in solving complex\r\nspatial problems.  This work will be guided by computational models of\r\nthe construction of 3-D spatial models from multiple views.  The\r\nsecond thrust is to advance the state of the art in human-computer\r\ninteraction by designing intelligent systems to train and assist human\r\nperformance in spatial problem solving.\r\n",
