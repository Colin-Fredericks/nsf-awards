 "awd_abstract_narration": "The unprecedented, exponential growth of the Internet has far outstripped the capacity of the\r\ntools needed to analyze modern networks.  Simulation remains the method of choice for network\r\ndesigners, researchers, and managers for many analysis problems.  However, modern simulation\r\ntools are typically limited to analyzing tens to hundreds of network nodes, while studies of\r\ncurrent and future networks such as the next generation Internet call for analyses of thousands to\r\nmillions.  New, practical approaches to network modeling and simulation are needed to address\r\nthis growing problem.\r\n     Two frequently heard problems with simulation technology today are (1) the excessive amount\r\nof time required to construct a model for a large network, and (2) the inordinate amount of\r\ncomputer time required to execute the resulting simulation program.  This project, called\r\nCOMPASS (COMposable and PArallel Simulation of internetworkS), will attack the first\r\nproblem by defining and realizing an approach to enable rapid construction of network models\r\nby reusing model components developed by others, possibly using different simulation software\r\npackages.  The second problem will be attacked through execution of the model on parallel\r\nand/or distributed computers.  In this regard, this project will focus on realizing a practical,\r\nflexible, approach to parallelization that can be widely exploited by the networking community.\r\nThis approach, based on composing (federating) autonomous simulators executing on different\r\nprocessors, cleanly separates the parallel and sequential portions of the simulation, allowing\r\nconcurrent optimization and refinement of each.  A related problem that will be studied concerns\r\nexecution of models over a geographically distributed area in situations where model\r\ncomponents cannot be easily co-located.\r\n     To demonstrate this approach, an optimized parallel/distributed implementation of the ns2\r\nsimulator will be realized as part of this project.  This software will be realized on widely\r\navailable computing platforms and will be made freely available to the networking community in\r\ncollaboration with the VINT/ns group at USC/ISI.  Because ns2 is widely used in the networking\r\ncommunity, the potential impact of this project is large. Moreover, the ability to easily reuse\r\nnetwork models developed by others using different simulation packages can lead to a paradigm\r\nshift in the way modeling and simulation is routinely practiced in the networking community.\r\nFinally, simulation of multicast protocols will be used as a vehicle to evaluate and refine the\r\nparallel simulation designs and demonstrate their effectiveness.  Multicast protocols have a\r\nparticularly strong need for scalable simulation tools.  It is an area where new ideas and\r\nproposals are still being generated.  Research in this project will focus on multicast protocols that\r\nare of current interest to the Internet community; reliable multicast, layered video multicast and\r\ndata dissemination applications will be studied.  This work will not only provide a proof of\r\nconcept for the parallel simulation research, but will also provide an improved evaluation\r\ncapability to the networking community for solutions to problems of current interest.\r\n",
