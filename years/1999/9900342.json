 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology supports the research of Professor Andrei Tokmakoff.  The theme of the research is the investigation of the ultrafast dynamics of water and aqueous solutes using one- and two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopies.  The collective dynamics of neat water and variable H2O/D2O mixtures will be probed using two-dimensional Raman experiments which are sensitive to heterogeneity and to the mechanism of coupling between vibrations.  Polarization-selective one-dimensional Raman experiments on all elements of the tensorial response will be used to separate rotational, translational, and coupled intermolecular motions.  Infrared pump-probe experiments on aqueous solutes will be used to probe solute-solvent interactions.  Systematic experiments in water will be used to understand the mechanism of intermolecular relaxation and determine which motions of water preferentially couple to solute vibrations.\r\n\r\nResults from this project will help understand the details of interactions between and within molecules and will help explain how these interactions give rise to the properties and overall chemical reactivity displayed by materials in the bulk.  Such an understanding can lead to the ability to predict the outcome of chemical reactions and physical processes in condensed phases of matter.\r\n",
