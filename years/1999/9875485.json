 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is grounded in a theoretical framework that specifies\r\nkey epistemological features of scientific experimentation.  On the basis\r\nof this framework, the project will develop a computer-based environment in which\r\nseventh graders can conduct simulated experiments in the domain of cell\r\nbiology.   The simulated experiments will be designed to capture many of\r\nthe crucial epistemological features of authentic scientific\r\nexperimentation.  The computer-based experimentation environment will then\r\nbe used in a series of studies to investigate how students learn complex\r\nforms of scientific reasoning.  A main focus of the studies will be to\r\ninvestigate the sociocognitive processes by which computer simulations\r\npromote complex learning during classroom instruction.  The planned studies\r\ninclude two large classroom experiments that will provide a rich, detailed\r\npicture of how seventh graders' reasoning and knowledge of cells change,\r\nmoment to moment, during classroom instruction.  The classroom instruction,\r\nusing an instructional method called Collaborative Reasoning about\r\nEvidence, will interleave whole-class discussions with small-group work in\r\nwhich students conduct and discuss simulated experiments.  The studies will\r\naim to provide a fine-grained analysis of how whole-class discussions and\r\ngroup interactions mediate students' learning.  In sum, this program of\r\nresearch is intended (a) to provide new insights into how to teach students\r\nto reason about epistemologically authentic experimentation and (b) to\r\nproduce tested instructional software, materials, and methods that teachers\r\ncan readily access and use in their classrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
