 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II award is to continue development of an avalanche photodiode for use as a high gain photon imaging device. Phase II of this project includes the development of device structures optimized for two applications in low light level imaging: a single optical photon imaging device that generates the time and position of incidence for each detected optical photon event, and a scintillator coupled device that provides time and position of incidence information for high energy photons captured in an array of scintillator blocks. The imaging avalanche photodiode promises a lower cost, wider dynamic range alternative to microchannel plate based single photon imaging detectors and will provide data in a format that is more conducive to rapid analysis than traditional image files. Applications for the device include\r\n a variety of emerging techniques for real time in-vivo imaging of physiological and developmental processes such as reporter gene activity, calcium dynamics and free radical production using luminescent indicators. When coupled to a scintillator block array, the imaging avalanche photodiode promises a lower cost, smaller detector module than current photomultiplier-based approaches for compact geometry gamma ray imaging applications, with the added feature of being able to operate in high magnetic fields.\r\n     The imaging avalanche photodiodes (IAPD) will lead to the commercialization of a number of important, affordable instruments both for basic research as well as diagnostic screening. In addition to facilitating luminescence-based research, the IAPD will enable a more robust approach to gamma ray imaging for PET and dual use modalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
