 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports paleontological research on dinosaur and marine reptile fossils from Vega Island in the Antarctic Peninsula region. Field work during the 1997-98 austral summer field season yielded substantial numbers vertebrate and invertebrate fossils from the late Cretaceous deposits of Vega Island on the Antarctic Peninsula. The fossils represent a wide diversity of Late Cretaceous fauna. Not only was the first hadrosaur dinosaur from Antarctica discovered, but several specimens of marine reptiles (plesiosaurs and mosasaurs) were found and many were recovered. Heretofore, marine reptiles had been poorly known from Antarctica, with only one species having been described. This award supports the preparation, conservation, and research concerning the reptilian portion of the paleofaunal assemblages of the Lopez de Bertodano Formation on Vega Island.\r\n\r\nThe fossil reptile specimens, including numerous juveniles, were an unexpected discovery during field research on late Cretaceous mammals on Vega Island (see NSF awards OPP-9615236 to M. O. Woodburne and OPP-9615933 to J. A. Case). At least two different mosasaurs were found, two plesiosaurs, and the first evidence of a hadrosaurian dinosaur.  The hadrosaur indicates that a dispersal route at least by the latest Maastrichtian (the Maastrichtian encompasses the period from about 74 to 66 million years ago) provided an avenue for dispersal of terrestrial creatures from North America through South America to at least Antarctica, and aids in the postulated route to Australia. The marine reptiles also demonstrate previously unrecognized paleogeographic relationships, and the pursuit of these relationships forms the basis for continued field work under this award. At least one mosasaur taxon appears to persist longer in Gondwana, whereas the other may have closer affinities with northern taxa. The plesiosaurs from Antarctica also appear to have relict distribution among the Gondwanan continents, as most northern relatives are extinct by the Cretaceous. At this point, these paleogeographic relationships are working hypotheses which must be tested by the recovery of additional specimens and by study of the history and distribution of Gondwanan marine reptiles. Because of Antarctica's position at the center of Gondwana during the Late Cretaceous, its study is crucial to the understanding of the distribution of marine reptiles. This awards supports further work on the existing collections as well as new field work for recovery of the dinosaur and marine reptile fossils located last field season.\r\n",
