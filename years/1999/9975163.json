 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n     In this project, the location and behavior of roots of desert plants will be examined with respect to variation in the availability of soil water, the limiting factor in such arid regions.  Because rainfall occurs during only brief periods in the desert, existing roots must be able to take up water quickly or the plants must be able to produce new highly absorptive roots in response to such rainfall.  Also, the soil does not dry out uniformly during drought, as wetter regions can occur deeper in the soil, under rocks, or in rock crevices.  Thus, the ability to take up water can vary along the length of a root.  Roots of plants growing in the Sonoran Desert of the southwestern United States will be examined with respect to where along their length water uptake occurs, whether special root properties develop in wetter parts of the soil, and whether roots branch more in wetter regions.  Such examination will involve root excavations after various watering treatments in the field, plus laboratory investigation into the structural characteristics of roots that receive varied amounts of water.\r\n     The water uptake characteristics of plant species with different root architectures will be compared.  In particular, the investigators will examine roots of an agave with thick water-storing leaves and unbranched roots (Agave deserti), a grass with thin leaves and unbranched roots (Pleuraphis rigida), a cactus with thick stems and highly branched roots (Opuntia basilaris), and a small shrub with thin leaves and highly branched roots (Encelia farinosa).  The species with thick leaves or stems can store much water and so may have different root responses in the early phases of drought than do those with thin leaves.  Also, species with roots that can readily branch and thus proliferate in wetter regions of the soil will be compared with those with relatively unbranched roots.  Water uptake ability per amount of root will be evaluated with respect to the variations in water due to depth in the soil and to seasonal differences such as time after rainfall and time during drought.  This will help explain the present distribution of plants in deserts and whether changes in occurrence are expected in the future as climate changes.  Changes in root properties of desert plants due to variations in soil moisture can also be used to predict plant responses in moister habitats where more extreme fluctuations in rainfall may occur in the future.\r\n\r\n",
