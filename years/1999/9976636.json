The research involves evaluation of chiral hypervalent iodine compounds as asymmetric reagents.  The investigators propose to synthesize and characterize new iodinane reagents, their intermediates, and the product of their reactions with compounds containing carbon-carbon double bonds.  NMR, MS and elemental analysis will be applied in these studies.\r\n\r\nThis project initiates a new collaboration with Swiss researchers and provides an international research opportunity to an assistant professor at a predominantly US undergraduate institution and to his undergraduate students.  Students will gain research experiences in organic chemistry, including multistep synthesis of chiral nonracemic compounds, and in synthetic methodology.  The project takes advantage of Swiss expertise in the area of chiral hypervalent iodine compounds.\r\n",
