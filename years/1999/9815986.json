Langevin-type dynamical models of alloys where the order-disorder transition is accompanied by a structural distortion will be studied.  Interactions and pair-correlation functions calculated from electronic structure theory will be used to construct these models.  Fluctuation driven first order transitions that occur in diblock copolymers and are also believed to be relevant to ordering in a large class of alloys will be studied.  A combination of numerical simulation and field theory techniques using the dynamical action formalism will be used to investigate nucleation and growth processes that occur in these transitions.  Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a frustrated spin model inspired by studies of alloys will be carried out.  The aim of this work is to gain insight into the nature of the glass transition and the origin of slow dynamics and aging in glasses.    \r\n%%%\r\nThis award supports multidisciplinary research and education to study processes that occur on long time scales and are important to growth and phase transitions that occur in alloys, polymers, and glasses.  These studies include the kinetics of growth in transition metal alloys such as Ni-V, Cu-Pd, and Cu-Au and phase transitions in diblock copolymers.  \r\n***\r\n",
