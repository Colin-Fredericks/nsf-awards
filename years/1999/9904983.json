 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines strategic behavior in relation to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Three opportunities for strategic behavior will be investigated: referral of cases by national courts, court decisions, and national court/litigant compliance with ECJ decisions.  The research hypothesis to be investigated here is that both national courts and the ECJ are strategic actors, the main goals of which are to retain and increase legitimacy while at the same time to participate in the development of legal jurisprudence. In light of these goals, within the process under investigation, courts will manipulate institutional constraints in the following manner: national courts frame issues in cases sent to the ECJ, the European Court suppresses or expands issues, and national courts and litigants practice (non)compliance. These players interact in a strategic \"transsemantic\" game that begins at the national level and transcends this legal boundary to the European one. To test these hypotheses, the research investigates all cases brought before the ECJ for the top three referring national court systems in the following areas of law: free movement of goods, free movement of workers, and equal treatment cases within social policy.  Finally, to create a basis for comparison, the research examines the issue-fluidity hypothesis with data from the U.S. Supreme Court during two periods which differ in their degree of docket control available to the Court (1865-1891 and 1988-1992).",
