This addition makes innovative use of live theater techniques to provide interactive programming for the visiting audience.  The Great Lakes Science Center is a relatively new addition to the Informal Science arena but the visitation has double the expected projections. The programs for the situation room are:  Science and Information Technology Show; Great Lakes Data Quest; My Own House Data Quest; and Mathematics All Around Us.  These new programs, linked to the Great Lakes Environment and exhibitions throughout the facility will further enable the visitor to actually learn about science, environment, and technology using a unique format and \"state of the arts\" tools made available by informational technology.  \r\n\r\nThis project will impact a large, diverse audience in the Great Lake's area and beyond.  It has the potential for replication in other museums and science centers.  The goals of this project are to enhance the visitor's experiences and learning while at the science center.  The themes for the programs will explore some popular topics among the visiting audience.  This is a three-year project that will quintuple the programming capacity of the theater, enhance its role in providing Informal Science Education, provide new active learning experiences  and expand the center's capacity for accommodating larger audiences of families and school students.\r\n\r\nThe cost sharing for this award is 66.5% of the projected total budget.\r\n\r\n",
