 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chinese industry is at a critical stage - it is on the threshold of a second transition. Following a generally successful initial transition that has largely occurred within the envelope of transitional technologies and institutional forms, China's industrial economy is now marked by a productivity slowdown and excess capacity. With easy gains achieved, the Chinese are looking at the need for a vast restructuring that might involve millions of enterprises.\r\n\r\nIn order to sustain high rates of industrial output and productivity growth, China's industrial enterprises will have to learn to innovate and adapt new technologies that are closer to the international frontier. The incentive and institutional capabilities required to achieve technological catch-up will require accelerated reform of both systems of governance and China's emerging property rights market. The central idea of this proposal is that, with the support of a strikingly rich database, we can examine the determinants of innovation and technology transfer across a wide range of institutional settings within China. The relevant institutions include industrial enterprises of various ownership types, universities and research institutes, markets, and government policies and programs that shape incentives and capabilities.\r\n\r\nConsisting of 3 U.S. scholars, 5 Chinese scholars, and recent and current doctoral candidates, our research team proposes to pool its experience in the areas of U. S. and Chinese industrial organization and technical change. We expect our collaboration to enlarge the scope and quality of research at the intersection of innovation, technology transfer, and institutional change in Chinese industry.\r\n\r\nOur research program can be summarized by a 5-equation model that explains R&D effort, technology acquisition, R&D output, technology transfer, and firm performance. The variables that drive these outcomes include a wide range of enterprise characteristics, market and industry characteristics, institutional characteristics, and government policy and programs. The body of industrial organization theory and empirical results largely based on the experience of advanced industrial countries guides our investigation of these relationships. The empirical work builds on seven data sets, of which 6 are enterprise level surveys. At least one of these provides the data required to estimate the 5-equation model as a system. The other data sets allow for estimating one or more of the equations with varying degrees of emphasis on forms of non-state ownership, international technology transfer, and the impact of managerial property rights, objectives, and attitudes on the innovation process.\r\n\r\nA central purpose of our research is to combine the complementary training of the U.S. researchers with the capabilities of the Chinese researchers to publish collaborative research in mainstream U. S. journals. Introducing this work into the U. S. academic literature will at once subject it to scholarly review and also suggest for both U.S. and Chinese scholars and policy-makers new avenues of research on the role of institutions and policy in motivating innovation and technology transfer.\r\n",
