The proposed project is a continuation and extension of research previously funded by the NSF.  \r\n\r\nA major component of the effort will be to collect and annotate a large database of speech samples from both normally-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners, for use with the proposed work and also to facilitate other research efforts in this field.  Extensive experiments will be conducted to optimize the conversion of speech parameters to display parameters so that phonemes and distinctive features of phonemes, produced either in isolation, syllabic contexts, or as part of continuous speech, can readily be discriminated and identified based on their display characteristics.  Automatic speech recognition algorithms will be developed and refined to create a visual display representation.   Acoustic features will be extracted from the peak envelope spectrum, fundamental frequency, and short-time energy.   Several recognition strategies, all using neural networks as a key building block, will be investigated.    Visual displays will be developed and tested for several speech training exercises at various levels of complexity-ranging from distinctive features for phones produced in isolation to phonetic displays for continuous speech.   One display mode will be developed which provides a continuous relationship between articulatory features for vowel and consonant production and displayed patterns, and will show both degree and directions of any needed corrections in articulation.  Additionally, discrete displays, such as bargraphs or games, will indicate the closeness of a production to a \"normal\" production.  \r\n\r\nThe emphasis of the research is to improve automatic phonetic recognition to the level that the feedback given by the algorithm is as accurate and consistent as that which would be possible by an expert experienced listener.  Controlled evaluation experiments will be conducted to determine the extent to which \"new\" speech articulation patterns can be learned on the basis of the feedback given from the various displays.  Speech articulation training exercises will also be conducted with hearing-impaired children to assess the usefulness of the visual display in improving speech production and to help determine methods to improve it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
