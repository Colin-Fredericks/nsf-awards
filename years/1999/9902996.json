The specific goals in this study are: to characterize (for the first time) the atomic and electronic surface structure of certain manganese oxides (manganite, hollandite and pyrolusite) using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy; to describe redox interactions (including oxidation/reduction, sorption/desorption, and dissolution processes) between several manganese oxides (manganite, hollandite, pyrolusite, and birnessite) and aqueous Co(II) and Cr(III) using principally fluid-cell atomic force microscopy, Auger and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, and wet-chemical techniques, as well as scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy; and to develop new models for these interactions which combine our observations and assessments with the excellent store of information already available for many of these aqueous metal - mineral interactions.  The research performed in this project will allow us to address previously unresolved issues concerning environmentally important, redox-mediated mineral-water interface reactions.  Such issues include surface heterogeneity, various temporal aspects, the role of near-surface absorption and diffusion, and specific structural, chemical, and physical factors that control aqueous metal oxidation efficiencies.   \r\n",
