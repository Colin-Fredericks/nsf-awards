Furthermore, subtle yet important aspects of scales and\r\ninteractions among scales need to be understood to better comprehend soil\r\nbehavior. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this study is to discern unique phenomena in soils given the\r\ncoexistence of multiple internal scales (spatial and temporal), and their\r\neffect on macroscale soil behavior. The proposed study centers on the following\r\ngeotechnical processes: diffusion (selected because of its apparent\r\ninsensitivity to internal scales), drained stress-strain behavior, pore\r\npressure (generation, dissipation and coupling). These processes will be\r\naddressed with integral experimental and analytical tasks. A complementary\r\nresearch phase will be driven towards the development of engineering design\r\nprocedures.\r\n\r\nThis research has the potential for the clarification and fundamental\r\nexplanation of frequently observed behavior in geo-mechanic and\r\ngeo-environmental situations, and for the discovery of unique phenomena related\r\nto multiple scales and their interaction. Results from this research will guide\r\nthe development of enhanced procedures for the interpretation of\r\nhigh-resolution site characterization data (e.g., piezo-CPT and geophysical\r\ntests such as GPR and tomographic images). Furthermore, these results will also\r\npromote the development of enhanced engineering design methodologies that\r\nrecognize multiple internal scales in global response (foundation engineering,\r\ndynamic response, contamination and remediation, petroleum geomechanics).\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
