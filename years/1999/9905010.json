 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is to construct and empirically apply new semiparametric and nonparametric estimators for limited dependent variable models, especially binary choice, censored, and truncated regression models. The project employs the new estimators in empirical appli-cations having important policy implications. The willingness-to pay models are designed to estimate means, medians, and other features of the conditional distribution of a population's willingness to pay for public goods. The censored regression estimators will be used to assess the effects of tax and income policies on the demand for durables and other consumption categories in which many \"zeros\" are observed. The binary choice estimator will be applied to model female labor supply decisions, allowing for badly measured covariates such as household asset income.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the project develops a root n consistent, asymptotically normal binary choice model estimator that permits some general forms of unknown heteroscedasticity, along with extensions to ordered choice, multinomial choice, and censored re-gression models.  The binary choice estimator is particularly well suited for studying the \"Willingness-To-Pay\" models that arise in valuing public goods. The investigator continues his work on this class of applications, along with variants of the estimator that use a data sorting method to eliminate the need for a first stage kernel density estimator.\r\n\r\nA panel data extension of the estimator is also developed. This extension permits estimation of coefficients in a binary choice panel data model with fixed effects, weakly exogenous regressors, and unknown error distribution.  Extensions of the estimator to handle endogenous or mismeasured regres-sors will also be investigated. These and the panel data extension will be applied to an empirical study of labor supply decisions.  Separate from the above, a new set of nonparametric estimators for censored and truncated regression models are proposed. In these models, both the la-tent regression function and the distribution of the errors are nonparametrically identified and estimated.\r\n\r\n",
