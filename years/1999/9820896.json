 "awd_abstract_narration": "CCR-9820896\r\nVazirani\r\n\r\nThis project pursues research in the following areas:\r\n\r\n1. The metric Steiner tree problem and its generalizations:  Developing an algorithm using the bidirected cut relaxation for the metric Steiner tree problem and determining the integrality gap of this remarkable relaxation - this is widely believed to be the most promising avenue for better algorithms for this central problem.  Developing a combinatorial factor 2 algorithm for the generalized Steiner network problem.\r\n\r\n2. Extending the scope of the primal-dual schema:  Several problems are identified, that appear to be waiting for the \"right kind\" of primal-dual approach, including a facility location problem, metric TSP and integer multicommodity flow in planar graphs; besides the problems mentioned in (1) above.  The RV-algorithm extends the schema in two ways: for the first time the dual growth process is not greedy, and the algorithm does not use the usual mechanism of relaxing complementary slackness conditions.\r\n\r\n3. Efficient construction of an FPRAS using an unbiased estimator:  This research concerns the foundations of randomized approximation algorithms and its relationship with parametric statistical inference.  Issues of computational efficiency, and a conjecture on the degree of improvement provided by a variant on the standard \"median\" method, are studied.\r\n\r\n4. Industry targeted implementation of Steiner tree algorithms:  None of the currently known Steiner tree algorithms with proven guarantee is appropriate as the core algorithmic idea for use in the VLSI design industry.  The goal is not just to present experimental evidence, but to develop, around sophisticated ideas, a package that competes with commercial Steiner tree code.\r\n\r\n5. Coding theory:  Coordinate permutation can drastically reduce the size of a minimal trellis for a given code.  Recently, the problem of finding the optimal permutation was shown to be NP-hard, thus partially resolving a long standing open problem.  It is now important to seek good approximation algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
