The PI's main\r\nobjective in the proposed research is to understand four closely\r\nrelated important types of solitons in field theories:\r\nelectroweak dyons, coexisting vortices and antivortices,\r\nFaddeev's knot-like solutions, and the Born--Infeld solutions.\r\nElectroweak dyons are electrically and magnetically charged\r\nlocalized solutions in the Weinberg--Salam unified theory for\r\nelectromagnetic and weak forces in particle physics and the\r\nexistence problem is a variational problem with indefinite action\r\nfunctional involving delicate constraint invariants and subtle\r\nweak compactness issues.  The coexisting vortices and\r\nantivortices appear in a newly discovered field theory and the PI\r\nproposes to develop a full existence analysis and study the\r\ntopological and analytic structures of the solutions.  Stable\r\nknot-like structures are important in describing several\r\nfundamental processes including particle interactions and DNA\r\nchain interferences. The PI plans to study its mathematical\r\nexistence theory and dynamical properties.  The Born--Infeld\r\ntheory has received much attention recently due to its relevance\r\nin some areas of superstrings and supersymmetry.  The PI will\r\nstudy classical solutions arising from the Born--Infeld theory\r\nand their connections with geometry and physics.\r\n\r\nThese mathematical problems are not only interesting and\r\nchallenging, but also have important applications in a wide range\r\nof areas including superconductivity and superfluids, particle\r\nphysics, cosmology, and molecular biology.  On the educational\r\nside, the PI has already been involved in developing\r\nundergraduate curriculum modules based upon applications of\r\nmathematics. The research presented in this proposal will provide\r\nnew ideas for demonstrating the vivid interactions between\r\nmathematics and other areas of natural science.\r\n",
