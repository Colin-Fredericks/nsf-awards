The exponentially\r\ngrowing scale of use of the \r\nWeb is stressing the capacity of the Internet and leads to poor performance\r\nand low reliability of \r\nWeb service. Replication is one of the major techniques that have been\r\nproposed to overcome these problems.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on the development of a prototype system that will\r\nprovide a scalable \r\narchitecture for replication on the Web.  A new client/server architecture\r\nthat will allow for user-transparent geographic replication is\r\ninvestigated. In this system, the clients are downloaded as \r\nsigned applets to commercially available browsers. Web servers that support\r\nservlets can be\r\ndirectly extended with servlets, otherwise with server-side proxies that\r\nsupport servlets. Unlike \r\nother proposed Web architectures, both clients and servers take active\r\nroles in this architecture.\r\nServer machines determine the documents to be replicated/migrated and best\r\nlocations for the \r\ndocuments, while client machines choose the best server to submit their\r\nrequests based on estimates of the servers' prior response times. Heuristic\r\nalgorithms based on clustering techniques\r\nwill be developed in order to determine sets of documents that be\r\nbeneficially migrated/replicated as a unit.\r\n                                        \r\n\r\n",
