Furthermore the project will develop an algebra which will identify how elementary performance models of system components and application algorithms should be composed to reflect the performance of the application executing on parallel machines, Grids or  GiBs platforms.\r\n\r\nThe project will test the developed methods in three production class applications, a scientific application including a visualization component, an application using AMR algorithms, and an ASCI class application.  Among the hardware architectures  to be modeled, the complex HTMT architecture is included in this study.  \r\n\r\nThe resulting will make some important advances in the  system level hardware-software codesign.  Specifically the proposed work will benefit computing system designers, application designers, and  compiler developers in building their respective class of systems.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
