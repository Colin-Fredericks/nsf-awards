This Conference is sponsored jointly by the American Institute of Physics and the Magnetics Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, in cooperation with the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, the Office of Naval Research, the American Society for Testing and Materials, the American Physical Society, and the American Ceramic Society.  The proposed budget for this grant is $5000, to provide partial travel and lodging support to ten students as described in the proposed budget.  A request for partial support is also being requested from the Magnetics Society of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers, and for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.\r\n\r\nGraduate students play a key role in the advancement of new and enabling ideas.  Graduate students, particularly those in their final years of doctoral study, have expertise that is closely tied to the development, demonstration, and understanding of new concepts and technologies.  The dissemination of these concepts, along with the intellectual development of the students that is a consequence of scientific and technical interaction, supports long-term leadership needed by the technical community.  The funding provided by NSF can enable the MMM Conference to invite graduate students from the U.S. and abroad to present papers in key areas of magnetism and to benefit from discussions with experts in the field.  With breadth and quality, these presentations and interactions are an integral part of each Conference.  Such interactions are essential if the Conference is to serve its purpose of providing an effective forum for the discussion of new state-of-the-art results and developments in magnetics to the domestic and international scientific community.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
