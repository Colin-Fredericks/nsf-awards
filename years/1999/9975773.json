 "awd_abstract_narration": "Belfield\r\nThe unique properties associated with simultaneous absorption of two-photons,\r\nthe investigation of two-photon fluorescence imaging as a nondestructive technique for\r\nthe imaging of a variety of materials and interfaces, including polymeric materials,\r\ncoatings, and composites will be investigated.  The characteristic three-dimensional spatial resolution of the two-photon absorption process will be harnessed for three-dimensional photoinitiated polymerization and lithography.  The scanning microscopy system will be modified to accommodate use of the near-IR laser.\r\n\r\nThe research to be done with this system is expected to have broad impact on materials fields, from facilitating fundamental studies of multiphase systems and polymer processing techniques to direct application in addressing current and emerging issues related to nondestructive evaluation, failure analysis, failure prediction, and microfabrication. In addition to advancing the fields of materials analysis and processing, these efforts will make great strides in cross-disciplinary education and training of future scientists and engineers. These professionals will possess a unique set of skills in polymer and materials science, materials processing, and optical systems.  The two-photon techniques will be incorporated into existing courses in polymer chemistry, polymer science and engineering, chemistry of materials, and nonlinear optics.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\nThis system will significantly enhance the institutional infrastructure and commitment to the integration of research and education in a critical area of technology.\r\n \r\n",
