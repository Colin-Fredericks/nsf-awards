It provides funding for a workshop on improving undergraduate education in the mathematical and physical sciences through use of technology.  The workshop will be held July 20-22, 1999 in Arlington, VA and will involve approximately ninety participants well versed in research and undergraduate education in the MPS disciplines and in the use of technology in those settings.  Under the direction of Professor Arthur Ellis of the University of Wisconsin and a broadly informed external steering committee, the workshop will seek to identify current effective practices in the use of technology in undergraduate MPS education; research in MPS that benefits the development of technology for undergraduate education in the MPS disciplines; challenges and opportunities to enhance learning in the MPS disciplines through the effective use of technology; strategies to engage the MPS community in the more effective use of technology in undergraduate education; and mechanisms to ensure access to effective technologies by all genre of institutions.  Also to be addressed by the workshop are implications that technology-assisted learning has for the integration of research and education; K-12 teacher education and continued professional development; increased participation and success of groups underrepresented in the MPS disciplines; and increased scientific literacy for all citizens.\r\n\r\nThe report from this workshop is expected to provide important guidance to the effective utilization of technology in undergraduate education in the MPS disciplines.\r\n",
