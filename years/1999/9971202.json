These will focus on Helly-type theorems and are\r\naimed at determining whether or not a set is starshaped.  A major\r\nobjective is to extend Krasnosel'skii's theorem beyond the\r\nsetting of compact sets.  Paul Goodey's work will focus on the\r\ndetermination of high dimensional geometric information from low\r\ndimensional data.  This data usually arises from sections or\r\nprojections of the high dimensional object.  In recent years some\r\nsurprising connections between projections and sections have\r\nemerged.  He will try to find further connections and to obtain a\r\nsystematic explanation of these phenomena.  It is anticipated\r\nthat the techniques to be used will be drawn from harmonic\r\nanalysis, group representation theory and classical convex\r\ngeometry.\r\n\r\nThe geometric questions to be considered under this grant have\r\napplications in quite diverse areas.  At a purely geometric\r\nlevel, the study of visibility questions is connected with\r\nrobotics.  Helly-type theorems have been shown to have\r\nsignificance for geometric optimization algorithms.  In fact,\r\nHelly numbers determine bounds for the speed at which certain\r\nalgorithms proceed.  Reconstruction of objects from low\r\ndimensional data lies at the heart of stereology and tomography.\r\nThe study of sections, in this context, amounts to studying\r\nslices of the object under consideration.  The ability to obtain\r\ninformation about the original object from these slices has\r\nimplications throughout geosciences and in medical research, for\r\nexample.  Projections of objects are synonymous with X-rays.\r\nSome of the projects to be addressed will have implications for\r\nthe reconstruction of objects from their X-rays and for the\r\ndesign of efficient algorithms to achieve such reconstruction.\r\n",
