Alexander\r\nTitle:  The Shiny Cowbird and the Village Weaver - A Model System for\r\nStudying Change in Host Response to Brood Parasitism\r\n\r\nBrood parasitism in birds occurs when the females of one species lay their\r\neggs in the nests of a host species.  The host species then rears the\r\noffspring of the parasite.  Host species may evolve defenses against brood\r\nparasitism.  One such defense is egg rejection in which eggs of the\r\nparasitic species are removed from the nest.  A host species, the Village\r\nWeaver, was introduced to the island of Hispaniola without its brood\r\nparasite.  Studies conducted in 1982-1985 by Dr. Cruz showed that in the\r\nabsence of its brood parasite the village weaver ceased to exhibit egg\r\nrejection behavior.  Recently, the shiny cow bird, a brood parasite of the\r\nvillage weaver, has been introduced to the island of Hispaniola thereby\r\nproducing a unique natural experiment for study of how host defense\r\nbehavior against brood parasitism may evolve.  Dr. Cruz will determine the\r\nlength of time that populations of the village weaver have been exposed to\r\nthe brood parasite; and will determine how defense behaviors such as egg\r\nrejection and aggression toward the brood parasite are correlated with the\r\ntime of exposure.\r\n\r\nThis research has great potential for the understanding of avian brood\r\nparasitism.  It has broad evolutionary implications as it will provide an\r\nestimate of the time needed for a host species to evolve defensive\r\nbehavior.  In addition, because brood parasitism by cow birds may pose a\r\nthreat to migratory song birds in North America, it is important that the\r\ndynamics of brood parasitism and host defense be understood.  This\r\nknowledge could be of importance with regard to conservation of avian\r\ndiversity.\r\n",
