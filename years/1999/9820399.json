 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Student Program is an 11-week research apprenticeship program in which students will conduct independent, basic research in mammalian genetics in the laboratory of a Jackson Laboratory scientist. Ten undergraduate students, selected from a nationwide pool of 250 applications, undertake and learn the fundamental steps in the practice of scientific research: How to ask a biological question; how to make and test an hypothesis; how to form a defensible interpretation of data; how to communicate results orally and in writing; and how to receive feedback and incorporate it into forward thinking. The overall theme is to expose the students to the professional life and habits of mind of a scientist.\r\nEach student's research will focus on one or more of the following areas: Cancer; Computational Biology/Bioinformatics; Developmental Biology and Aging; Genomics; Immunology/Hematology; Metabolic Diseases; Neurobiology and Sensory Deficits. Their mentors are members of the Laboratory's Research Staff, consisting of 37 scientists conducting full-time investigator-initiated research. The students devote most of their effort to their individual research projects, but the program also provides formal exposure to the breadth of genetics research at the Laboratory, to different paths leading to careers in science, and about the ethical conduct of research.\r\n",
