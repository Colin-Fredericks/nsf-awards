 "awd_abstract_narration": "This descriptive and experimental study has two purposes: (1) To describe the development of knowledge of five written science genres among second and third grade students in two types of instructional contexts: (a) instruction which incorporates authentic science literacy activities but without explicit teaching of the linguistic features of these genres; and (b) instruction which incorporates authentic science literacy activities with the addition of explicit teaching of the linguistic features of these genres;  (2) To compare the affects of instruction of types (a) and (b) on students' science reading and writing achievement. The five written genres chosen for focus in this study are all authentic to the discipline of science and will be involved in students' regular science instruction. As such, the study addresses important but under-researched questions about effective uses of text in primary grade science education. In addition, the study addresses key questions in the field of language and literacy regarding the efficacy of explicit teaching of discourses of power for learners from nonmainstream, low-social economic status (SES) communities.\r\n\r\nThe study will involve twelve classes drawn in equal numbers from low- and middle- SES school districts employing platoon-style science instruction (in which science for all classes within a school is taught by a single teacher). Each class will be followed as a cohort through second and third grade as they experience science instruction led by a science teacher trained in one of the two instructional interventions described above. The teachers' instruction and students' responses to it will be carefully monitored and documented over time. In addition, quantitative data about each student's ability to comprehend and communicate science content through specific genres will be collected at six points during the two years. Data analysis will allow comparison of the two instructional interventions and also test the effect, if any, of student SES.\r\n",
