The motivation is to isolate large dynamic structures from external disturbances; particularly large, brief disturbances.  Examples of these would be underwater shock events on submarines or bomb blast events on buildings.  The desire is to minimize the damage done to crucial components by actively isolating an internal structure from a rigid external structure. In doing so, this investigation will develop the overall control strategy but will also pay close attention to the actuation scheme used to carry out the control strategy.  The actuation scheme turns out to be an extremely non-trivial and essential component to the overall control strategy.  The significance and impact of this project are increased damage tolerance and survivability of the internal structure.  This would lead to increased safety for the occupants as well as a reduction in the cost of preparing the internal structure for extremely high acceleration levels.\r\nThe focus of this project will be on systems that are large in size, necessitating an actuation scheme that is able to provide high forces in a rapid manner.  Electronically controlled fluid actuation will be chosen as the appropriate technology.  The project will involve a blend of theoretical and experimental activities.  New ways and combinations of controlling nonlinear systems will be analyzed and developed.  These will then be tested and implemented on a vibration isolation testbed that will be developed under the first phase of the project duration.\r\n",
