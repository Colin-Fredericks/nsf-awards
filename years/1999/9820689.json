 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site on Human Technology Interactions at the University of Oklahoma.  This interdisciplinary REU Site will give undergraduates the opportunity to engage in research on human-technical systems.  A total of 15 students, 10 funded by NSF and 5 funded by OU will spend eight weeks in the program.  A student's time will be divided into three types of activity: individual research, team research, and collective activities.  Each student will participate in individual research within an active laboratory.  Research assistantships will be available in Cognitive Psychology, Social Psychology, Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, Library and Information Studies, History of Science, Information Systems, and Communication.  A distinguishing characteristic of this program is that students will also participate on one of three multidisciplinary research teams composed of undergraduates and supervised by faculty and graduate students.  Team projects will fall under the rubric of Community Networks, Computer-supported Cooperative Work, or Human-Computer Interaction.  To provide students a sense of community spirit of science, they will also participate in seminar series, workshop series, and special events.  Students will be recruited nationally and regionally with an emphasis on students who would otherwise have little opportunity to gain research experience or to develop technical expertise.  \r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n",
