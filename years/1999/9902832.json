 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Philip Stephens of the University of Southern California will use experimental and theoretical methods to help develop vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopy (VCD) for applications to a variety of chemical systems.  Initial studies will calibrate the accuracy of Density Functional Theory (DFT) methodology for large molecules (80-200 atoms) and transition metal-containing molecules.  In addition the reliability of continuum dielectric methods for including solvent effects on predicted structures and spectra will be examined.  Specific stereochemical problems dealing with the determination of absolute configuration (AC) and conformational analysis (CA) will be addressed.  Applications of VCD will be developed in several focussed areas, including supramolecular structure, metal-containing molecules, chiral polymers, and isotopic effects.  \r\n\r\nVibrational circular dichroism spectroscopy serves as both an analytical tool and a structural tool.  That is, this technique can be used both to identify and characterize chemical systems as well as to determine the three-dimensional structure of the molecules under study.  A large fraction of applications to date have involved biochemical systems, such as peptides, proteins, nucleotides and nucleic acids.  In this project the use of VCD will be extended to studying other types of chemical systems, such as organometallic catalysts.  The results of this project will likely be useful in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.\r\n",
