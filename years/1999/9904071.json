The conference emphasis is on current research in the field of high temperature corrosion under aggressive conditions.  Issues to be considered are stresses developed in oxidation, subsurface zone depletion, thermal barrier coatings, carbon/carbon composites and special effects in oxidation and oxidation as a production tool.  A retrospective of high temperature corrosion research in the 20th century and a panel discussion on future research directions in the field is planned.  The budget requested from NSF goes towards support of graduate students, post-doctorates and speakers.  Many foreign scientists have been invited to share their views on the subject.\r\n%%%\r\nDry corrosion is an active research area with direct relevance to industrial needs.  Both ceramic and metallic materials are covered in these sessions.  Recent advances in understanding oxidation resistance in materials contributes to improved high temperature life of many components.  In some cases oxidation is used to improve functionality of materials, such as for producing insulating layers.\r\n***\r\n",
