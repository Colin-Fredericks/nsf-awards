 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project adapts and implements a microcomputer based physics laboratory curricula developed by Thornton, Sokoloff and Laws.  The curricula, proven to assist students in understanding physics concepts,  enhances the physics laboratory at Shelton State Community College.  The advantage of MBL is to stimulate students into actively engaging in their physics education.  MBL promotes group learning by encouraging students to interact with each other while performing their laboratory projects.  Active participation by the students enhances the efficiency of their learning.   Microcomputer based laboratories are powerful learning tools enabling students to visualize the intricacies of physical phenomena.  This project impacts five physics courses:  calculus-based physics (two courses), non-calculus based physics (two courses) and physics for the non-science major (one course).",
