 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atherosclerosis is a disease of the large- and medium-size arteries, which  involves complex interactions between the artery wall and the blood flow.  Both  clinical observations and experimental results showed that the fluid shear stress acting on the artery wall plays a significant  role in the physical processes  which lead to atherosclerosis. Therefore, a sound understanding of the effect of the wall shear stress on atherosclerosis is of practical importance to blood flow research and early detection, prevention and treatment of the disease. The objective of this project is  to develop mathematical models to reveal the relationship between the disease processes and the wall shear stress in order to understand the effect of the wall shear stress on atherosclerosis. To achieve this goal,  three-dimensional mathematical models will be introduced to simulate the blood flow in arteries with atherosclerotic plaques. A finite element method with stabilization techniques will be applied to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a  free moving boundary, where the location and the size of the atherosclerotic  plaque is determined by a geometry update condition coupling  the information of the blood flow and the artery wall. To simulate the blood flow through  realistic carotid bifurcation and curved tubes, and also to analyze the development of atherosclerotic lesions, numerical computations will be carried out  allowing for variations of geometry and flow parameters under  physiological conditions. A successful accomplishment of this project will be very critical in advancing Dr. Liu's academic career. POWRE award will be very important to achieving such accomplishment.  It will allow her to establish a strong interdisciplinary research program in biomedical science and to use her computational skills in attacking significant problems in this field. It will provide financial support to recruit graduate students to this research program of scientific computation and mathematical modeling  in biomedical science.  This POWRE project is supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).",
