 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feng\r\n9974389\r\n     The investigators and her colleagues study and analyze the\r\ncomplex interactions between parasitic trematodes and their\r\ninvertebrate and vertebrate hosts by developing mathematical\r\nmodels that allow the prediction of changes in the population\r\ndynamics of both hosts and parasites.  Continuous deterministic\r\nmodels based on systems of differential equations are proposed\r\nand analyzed using the theory of dynamical systems and integral\r\nand differential equations.  Data gathered for the validation of\r\nthe models is fitted using standard statistical techniques.\r\nValidation of the simpler initial models is done by taking the\r\nprevalence values of infection of human hosts at two or more\r\npoints in time, and estimating prevalence of infection at other\r\npoints in time for which data is available.\r\n     A collaborative study is undertaken that combines the\r\ntheoretical and empirical experience of a parasitologist and the\r\nmodeling and theoretical expertise of mathematicians to\r\ninvestigate models of host-parasite interactions.  The scope of\r\nthis project is threefold:\r\n     *First, to model host-parasite interactions, with\r\nincreasingly complex models motivated by biological\r\nconsiderations;\r\n     *second, the study of mathematical properties of each model\r\nand their biological and ecological implications such as\r\npopulation control or potential species extinction;\r\n     *third, the validation of the models through comparison of\r\nmodel results with field data.  This project significantly\r\nadvances our knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of\r\nhost-parasite systems, by providing usable models to study\r\nnatural systems, by analyzing their sensitivity to the parameters\r\naffecting their dynamics, and by allowing the structuring of the\r\ncomplexities of the systems into hierarchies.  A specific example\r\nis the determination of the proportion of cases of\r\nschistosomiasis that need to be treated for the disease to be\r\neradicated, as well as the effect of drug-induced parasite\r\nmutation and the existence of more than one species of definitive\r\nhosts on the dynamics of transmission of this ailment.  Just as\r\nimportant is the possibility of extending the models developed in\r\nthis project to more complex systems involving three or more\r\nspecies, or stochastic environmental variability.\r\n",
