 "awd_abstract_narration": "9876056\r\nRaman\r\nThe primary objective of this research plan is to investigate methods for the direct integration of PCS band antennas on mixed-technology ICs. The PI has extensive experience with the development of integrated antennas at millimeter-wave frequencies, where the short wavelengths result in small physical dimensions allowing relatively straightforward on-chip antenna integration. However, it is a different matter to integrate an antenna on-chip at the lower PCS frequencies since antenna size cannot be arbitrarily reduced; physical laws rather than technological limits govern the performance of the antenna. Still, if some degradation of antenna performance can be accepted, very small antennas with respect to the wavelength of interest (electrically small antennas) can be realized. The proposed research effort will focus on three basic problem areas: (1) technology/material issues for integration of electrically small antennas on mixed-signal ICs; (2) interconnections, transitions and baluns; and (3) electromagnetic radiation coupling from the antenna into mixed-signal circuitry. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations will be used to analyze various antenna geometries prior to fabrication. Fabricated antennas will be characterized using a combination of on-wafer (input impedance) and anechoic chamber (patterns, gain, polarization purity) measurements. Sacrifices made in antenna performance to achieve on-chip integration will be evaluated.\r\nThe major thrusts of the educational efforts over the next several years will include: (1) a revitalization of the existing microwave engineering curriculum; and (2) the development of a graduate level course sequence in modern\r\nRFIC design. With these curriculum improvements, the ECE department at Virginia Tech will offer one of the most comprehensive programs in communications engineering in the country. These courses will also benefit the PI's research efforts in mixed-signal and mixed-technology integrated circuits, exposing students to the implementation of RF/microwave functions on a semiconductor chip, and complementing the digital VLSI design curriculum. In the long term, the PI is interested in developing an integrated design experience in single-chip systems for senior ECE students, in lieu of the traditional elective and capstone design coursework. The principal investigator will also endeavor to actively involve undergraduates in meaningful research experiences, and to contribute to the retention of  women and underrepresented minorities in science and engineering.\r\n",
