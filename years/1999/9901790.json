 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a data relay system utilizing the Iridium Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites for telecommand, control, and data retrieval from remote science platforms in polar regions.  A variety of commercial LEO satellite communications systems produced by the private sector for voice and data relay of all types are now in, or will soon achieve, operational status. Being close to Earth, their low-power, lightweight transmitters and receivers and omni-antennas can be used.  Commercial LEO networks offer considerable opportunities for science platforms in remote regions, including two-way communications, real-time data transmissions, global coverage, and reduced costs.  As a result, science platforms can be monitored, adjusted, and re-calibrated by scientists in real-time at their home laboratories and institutions.  A prototype Iridium data relay system will be fabricated under Phase II.  In a collaboration with Antarctic Support Associates and the University of Maryland Institute for Physical Science and Technology, Phase II will integrate  the Iridium data relay system  into an Automated Geophysical Observatory to verify the operation of the data retrieval scheme and to demonstrate the feasibility of two-way communications.\r\n     Potential applications are expected in polar research operations,  in relay of drifting buoy data for atmospheric and hydrological research, search and rescue operations, and command/control of unmanned aerial vehicles for environmental research and monitoring.  Other potential applications include the simplification of communications for business professionals, reporters for television networks, construction engineers, geologists, and people who live in thinly populated areas.\r\n",
