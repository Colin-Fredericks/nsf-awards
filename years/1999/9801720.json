 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801720\r\nWakimoto\r\n\t The Principal Investigator will pursue three research topics associated with severe local storms and mesoscale frontal structures: 1) tornadoes and tornadogenesis, 2) structure of bow-echo squall lines and squall-line initiation, and 3) mesoscale documentation of warm and cold frontal boundaries.  \r\nThere have been major advances in understanding of mid-level mesocyclones within supercell storms based on numerical simulations and observational studies.  However, knowl-edge concerning the genesis and dynamics of tornadoes has not progressed as rapidly.  This can be, in part, attributed to the difficulty of collecting high resolution data in the vicinity of these intense vortices.   Using unique data-sets collected during the Verification of Origins of Rotation in Thunderstorm Experiment, the Principal Investigator will pursue three outstanding questions that remain the focus of a considerable amount of research on tornadoes and tornadogenesis: I) What are the processes that lead to supercell tornadogenesis? 2) What is the relationship between the mesocyclone and the tornado? 3) Do supercell tornadoes descend from cloud base or build upward from the boundary layer?\r\nAn analysis of an intense supercell storm which did not spawn a tornado is currently underway.  Preliminary results suggest that a well-defined low-level mesocyclone developed on several occasions but did not lead to the initiation of a tornado.  Twenty-five passes of an airborne Doppler radar by the supercell are currently being synthesized.  A hypothesis to be tested is that vortex breakdown within the mesocyclone led to the development of an weak tornado.  \r\nTwo separate studies focusing on squall lines are currently underway.  First, a comprehensive data set on the structure of a bow echo is in the early stages of analysis. The bow echo is a radar signature that is often associated with downbursts and derechos. The present case provides an opportunity to examine the entire evolution of this echo from a linear structure to a bow-shaped.  A second study examines the initiation of an intense squall line as a result of the merger between a strong cold front and the dryline. Although the latter event is known to be a common initiation mechanism for the development of squall lines, there does not appear to be a study that has provided detailed measurements of this process.\r\nDuring the winter of 1997, an international field experiment called FASTEX (Fronts and Atlantic Storm Track Experiment) was organized to study oceanic cyclogenesis.  The primary data platforms were several research aircraft which released dropwindsondes, recorded in situ measure-ments at flight level, and collected high-resolution radar reflectivity and Doppler velocity informa-tion using on-board radars. Preliminary radar syntheses have revealed unprecedented kinematic structure of cold and warm fronts. Examination of the along-frontal structure and an assessment of frontogenesis using a combination of the Doppler wind field combined with numerous dropsondes deployed at high altitudes are proposed using the FASTEX data set.\r\nSuccessful completion of this research will add substantially to knowledge of severe local convective storms and to the mesoscale aspects of winter-time frontal structures.\r\n***\r\n",
