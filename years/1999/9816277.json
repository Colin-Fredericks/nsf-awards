Wilkens, Hawaii Institute of Geophysics, University of Hawaii, to pursue with Dr. Soo-Chul Park, Department of Oceanography, Chungnam National University, Korea, for 24 months, a program of cooperative research on acoustic properties of fine-grained gas-bearing sediments off the southeast coast of the Korean peninsula.  Acoustic turbidity caused by gas bubbles in seafloor sediments is a common occurrence worldwide, but it is as yet poorly understood.  Even minute traces of gas in sediments that do not exhibit acoustic turbidity can slow compressional wave velocity to such an extent as to influence the conversion of two-way seismic travel time to depth.\r\n\r\nThe upper 10 meters of the seafloor contain the largest gradients in physical and acoustic properties in the sediment-seawater system.  Within this zone porosity may change by 20-30% (1.0 to 0.7) and density may vary by 50% (1.02-1.50 gm/cc).  Compressional wave velocities usually change very little, remaining close to that of water, so that acoustic impedance changes and reflector positions are dictated by inflections in the density profile within this 10 meter layer.  One exception to this general rule is when gas is present in sediment pore fluids.  The PI has made measurements on the velocity of sound in gas-bearing sediment in the Baltic Sea, while his Korean collaborator is conducting such studies along the southeast coast of the Korean Peninsula.  The present award will allow the PI to visit Korea for joint planning and subsequent cooperative research, aboard Korean research vessels, to investigate in great detail the behavior of various properties above and within this near seafloor gassy sediment zone.  The scientific programs of both collaborators are expected to benefit greatly from the combination of measuring techniques and blending of expertise of the two research groups.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
