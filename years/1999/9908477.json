Landis is the founder and architect of the Minority Engineering Program at Cal State L.A., a national model for minority focused engineering initiatives, established over two decades ago.  He also established an innovative program to enhance cross-cultural communication between faculty advisors and minority students.  His engineering textbook for college freshmen has reached over 32,000 students at over 300 institutions.  His newsletter provides on-going support for science and mathematics teachers and engineering faculty.  And, his Chautauqua course has disseminated his methods to over 700 engineering educators from across the country.   Dr. Landis was able to identify 210 predominately minority mentees that earned engineering degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
