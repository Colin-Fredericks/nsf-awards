An immediate focus is\r\non the globular protein, yeast iso-l-cytochrome c. The apparatus to be employed\r\ninvolves dielectric resonator-based flow and stopped-flow EPR. The spin label\r\nmethod has the advantage that the label can be attached to any position in a protein that\r\ncan be mutated to cysteine, and the expression system for making such\r\nmutations has been established. To date the two common methods for studying\r\nearly folding events have been pulse label NMR spectroscopy and rapid flow\r\nfluorescence spectroscopy. This spin label method is dependent on neither\r\nhydrogen bonding (as is the NMR method), nor the existence of the\r\nsingle fluorescing tryptophan in cytochrome c. While the pulse label NMR\r\nand fluorescence results will provide a background, the combination of time\r\nresolution of stopped-flow and flow physical methods and label placement at\r\npreviously unstudied positions presents a singular opportunity to resolve a\r\nfundamental controversy concerning the early events in protein folding. The\r\ncontroversy is whether the early folding is a general hydrophobic collapse\r\nor whether early folding progresses through a sequence of substructures.\r\nThis controversy is of course not limited to cytochrome c; it is simply\r\nbest delineated so far in cytochrome c. The general hydrophobic collapse\r\nwould be reported similarly by spin probes at numerous positions; whereas a\r\nprogression of folding substructures at different locations would be\r\nreported differently and sequentially by probes at different locations. To\r\ntest the generality of this finding in cytochrome c, the plan for the\r\nfuture will be to probe other protein systems for their early folding\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThis study applies a new biophysical technique that relies on new\r\nmicrowave (electron paremagnetic resonance) and kinetic equipment to\r\nunderstand in a unique way how protein folding occurs in its early stages.\r\nA protein is a linear sequence of amino acid building blocks, and there is\r\nno consistent explanation yet for the time course for proteins to fold to\r\ntheir biologically functional 3-dimensional structure. A labeling procedure\r\nis used which puts probes at individual amino acid sites to tell if the\r\nsites are involved in folding. The apparatus will then be used to examine\r\nquickly within milliseconds after folding starts whether the\r\nlabeled amino acid is indeed already folded. The specific goal of this\r\nstudy, using probes at separate protein-engineered sites, is to resolve the\r\nquestion of whether a protein undergoes a universal collapse when folding\r\nstarts or whether folding progresses in a sequence from one part of the\r\nprotein to the next. It is presently not known whether the collapse model\r\nversus the sequential folding model is the proper one, and this kinetic\r\nmethod combined with localized probes is intended to determine what\r\nactually happens.\r\n",
