 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of Michigan supports the research of Professor Larry W. Beck.  The theme of the research is the investigation of the mechanism of heterogeneous catalysis processes through the design and synthesis of tailored materials and in-situ NMR characterization of the active catalyst.  Initial target projects of this research include acid-catalyzed addition reactions using aluminum and boron zeolites and partial oxidation catalysis using titanium zeolites.  Triple-resonance NMR techniques that explore dipole-dipole distances will be used to investigate the local structure of catalytic active sites under reaction conditions.  NMR will also be used to follow catalysis reactions in situ to identify key kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the mechanism.\r\n\r\nMany existing routes to the synthesis and manufacture of fine chemicals employ hazardous reagents, generate large amounts of waste, and are often inefficient.  Finding alternative environmentally benign processes using catalysts is a concern and growing priority in industry.  The mechanistic information gained in this project will be used to investigate possible new routes to important chemical intermediates.\r\n",
