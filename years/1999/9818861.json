Building on the previously funded Materials World Modules, MWM-2002 promotes inquiry-based materials science education by connecting key concepts in science and technology with real world applications.  The modules contain design challenges and hands-on activities that invite students to create prototype products that people use everyday -- polymers, ceramics, composites, biodegradable materials, etc.  Teachers order modules on-line by choosing from a series of menus that include options for class size, reading level, state and local frameworks and existing curricula.  Other menus allow the selection of pedagogical strategy, materials science content, science process, and technical systems.  Teachers download the modules, and the accompanying activity kits are shipped.  Through a website, teachers and students have access to a digital library and remote databases on materials science.  Students interact with other students, teachers and scientists.  Teachers can access resources for professional development including distance education workshops, assessment items and exemplary classroom practices.  The feedback on the website is used to fine-tune the modules and also the functioning of the website.  This project is co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Office of Interdisiplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n",
