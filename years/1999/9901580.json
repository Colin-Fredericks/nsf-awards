 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partial travel support for keynote speakers, reduced registration for graduate students, and organizational costs to the \"Third Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) Workshop\" (Santa Barbara, CA, September 16-18, 1999) has been awarded.  The workshop is structured to promote exchange of ideas concerning the theory and practice of PIV and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV), provide a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art, and develop scientific interactions of US researchers with experts from Europe and Japan.  Simultaneous point measurements of the velocity in two- or three-dimensional fields, as well as of temperature and concentration, would improve understanding of fluid flow phenomena.  Typical applications include turbulence, multi-phase, micro-scale, high-speed, and biomedical flows.  Many aspects of these techniques require further refinement and enhanced understanding to fully realize their potential.  Holding the Workshop in the US will significantly aid the exposure of our experimental community to the most recent developments and it will provide exposure for our researchers to establish contacts with international colleagues.",
