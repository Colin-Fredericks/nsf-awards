The project develops a prototype for a national digital library for Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology Education (SMETE).  It is to be a national resource that goes beyond a traditional academic library in digital form.  It is to be a digital learning space, serving a community of SMETE learners that encompasses faculty, students, and lifelong learners.  This project builds on previous grants that developed the prototype for a National Engineering Education Delivery System (NEEDS).  NEEDS will be the operational testbed for an expanded gateway to SMETE collections and content.   \r\n\r\nA series of focus groups is being held to define user needs, and a set of partnerships are being established with other national digital projects to extend the NEEDS testbed across multiple disciplines.  The goals of the project are:   1) to develop a model for assessing and defining user needs and use that model to define the system specifications,  2) to facilitate interaction between users of the content and collections, and 3) to build an interdisciplinary bridge across existing disciplinary communities.  \r\n\r\n",
