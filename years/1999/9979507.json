 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University in collaboration with 9 schools in 3 school districts (a large city setting, a University town setting and a dispersed rural setting) placed 14  K-12 Fellows in the system to facilitate the development of active science learning.  The Fellows are derived from a variety of disciplines that include Molecular and Cellular Biology, Mathematics, Physics, Chemical Engineering and Bioresource Engineering.  The Fellows are called \"Adopted Scientists\" in grades K-6 and \"Teaching Assistants\" in grades 7-12.  They spend 6 months in the schools and 3 months in extended outreach activities.  \r\n\tThis program will develop active science and mathematics learning through the use of 5 themes:  (1) Inquiry-based Learning; (2) Communication of Content; (3) Use of Appropriate Learning Styles; (4) Use of Technology; and (5) The Research Paradigm.\r\n\tDuring the initial tenure (summer), Fellows take 4 courses specifically designed for them by the Science and Mathematics Education Department (SMED).  In cooperation with the school district teachers, the Fellows attend a 2-day workshop.  A weekly seminar series is organized to facilitate in-class activities. Teachers from the school districts join the Fellows in the workshops at weekly meetings.\r\n\tAn aggressive performance assessment of the Fellows' in-class activities, extended outreach activities, and impact of the program is adequately detailed.",
