 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nPenney\r\n\r\nOne of the most fundamental  theorems  in  harmonic  analysis  on Riemannian  symmetric spaces is the Helgason theorem which states that any harmonic  function  may  be  represented  as  a  Poisson integral  over  the Furstenberg boundary.  Here, \"harmonic\" means that  the  function  is  annihilated  by  all  of  the  invariant differential  operators  which  have  no  constant  term.  For  a Hermitian symmetric space,  there  are  generalizations  of  this theorem   which  replace the Furstenberg boundary with the Shilov boundary and the invariant  differential  operators  with  larger systems   such   as  the  Hua-Johnson-Koranyi  operators  or  the Berline-Vergne operators or  the  Lassalle  operators.   In  this proposal  we  propose  generalizing the Helgason theory, as well as the Hua-Johnson-Koranyi theory, to the  context  of homogeneous Kaehler manifolds.\r\n\r\nHarmonic functions occur repeatedly in science  and  engineering, in  contexts such as heat flow, electricity, wave propagation and particle theory, just to name a few.  Many attempts to understand the  fundamental  properties  of  nature  are  based on ever more complicated spaces.  The solutions to many important physical and engineering  problems  on such spaces involve harmonic functions.  While the current techniques work reasonably well for  Riemannian\r\nsymmetric spaces, it it is clear that fundamental advances in the current technology  must  be  made  if  the  spaces  become  even slightly   more   complicated.   Furthermore,  the  required  new technology  will  certainly  yield  new   information   and   new techniques  in  harmonic theory on Riemannian symmetric spaces as well. We propose continuing our previous work which is  aimed  at the development of this technology. \r\n",
