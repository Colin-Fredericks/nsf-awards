In all cases microscopic mechanisms are responsible for their ground state behavior, but many open questions about the nature of these ground states remain even after intense theoretical and experimental investigations. Prominent are incoherent or non-Fermi liquid transport with magnetic field orientation in low dimensional metals; the details of electronic structure which influence magnetic or superconducting ground states in intermetallic compounds; and the intra-cluster magnetic mechanisms in nano-magnets such as manganese acetate. In these investigations the unique capabilities of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory will be utilized. Novel approaches to the determination of electronic structure will be implemented, thereby raising the utility of magneto-transport-based studies to a new level. In addition, studies of nano-magnetic clusters using nuclear decay methods will have a potential impact in the area of information storage at the quantum level. A strong commitment to education and public awareness in areas relevant to this research will be sustained, as will a high degree of international collaboration.\r\n%%%\r\nIn electronic and magnetic materials, sometimes subtle details of their structure determine their macroscopic physical properties. Will the material be a magnet? A superconductor? An insulator? Such details lead to materials of scientific importance and with potential applications. This research project addresses experimentally several classes of materials central to condensed matter physics -anisotropic conductors and superconductors, correlated electronic metals, and magnetic nano-clusters. In all cases microscopic mechanisms are responsible for their most important physical properties. In these investigations the unique capabilities of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory will be utilized, and a novel approach to the problem of electronic structure determination is proposed, which when implemented, will raise the utility of magnetoresistance-based studies for the characterization of materials to a new level. The magnetic studies too, have a potential impact in the area of information storage and processing at the quantum level, since intra-cluster switching mechanisms of the magnetization states in nano-magnets will be studied. A strong commitment is made to include educational outreach at all levels, and to provide outstanding graduate education opportunities which involve state-of-the-art instruments. Graduate students and post-doctoral associates are provided with training for a range of careers in industry, government and academe.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
