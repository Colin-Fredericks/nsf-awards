This research investigates inbreeding depression in species, such as trees or grasses, that live for many years. Goals are to: 1) develop genetically-based models of inbreeding depression in long lived perennials; and 2) develop methods for measuring inbreeding depression over short time spans, rather than over the entire perennial life history. Methods include computer and analytic modeling of specific, well documented, genetically-based inbreeding depression in perennials. Statistical methods will use patterns of genetic variation and information about individual age to infer the amount of inbreeding depression.\r\n\r\nThe research offers genetically explicit insight into inbreeding depression in perennials. It is anticipated that the research will provide guidance for breeding of long-lived plants important in, for instance, reforestry and fruit tree breeding. Greater understanding of inbreeding depression in perennials is an important consideration in developing conservation and natural resource management plans for the many ecosystems in which perennials predominate. Finally, the research provides basic insight into the interaction between life history and inbreeding depression. Such interactions are of particular importance in understanding the evolution and diversity of plant breeding systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
