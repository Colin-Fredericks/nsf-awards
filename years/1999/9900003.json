 "awd_abstract_narration": "The President's Information Technology Advisory Committee's Interim Report has recommended that the nation commit to fund considerably more research in several technical areas.  One of those areas is large-scale computer networking.  The PITAC report further suggests that NSF play the leading role in overseeing this research.\r\n\r\nA group of researchers in computer networking, from industry and the universities, propose to gather in a one-day workshop to discuss the PITAC report's findings and to prepare recommendations to guide the research recommended by PITAC.  These recommendations and report will serve as initial community views on what research initiatives in large-scale networking are likely to be most productive.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will be held on October 7, 1998 in Berkeley, California and will be chaired by Dr. Craig Partridge, Chief Scientist of BBN Technologies (a part of GTE corporation) and a Consulting Assistant Professor at Stanford University.  In consultation with senior researchers in the field, Dr. Partridge has extended invitations to roughly two dozen researchers, whose research interests and organizational affiliations span the computer networking field in the United States.\r\n",
