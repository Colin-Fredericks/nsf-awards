 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Adaptive Wavelet element method is a new mathematical method which is fundamentally more appropriate for highly parallel computing than existing methods.  This project studies scalable parallel algorithms and simulations based on adaptive wavelet methods for the investigation of combustion flow problems.  The project isa driven by the need for large scale simulation capability required by the intrinsic physical property of industrial applications.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this research is on parallel wavelet simulation of combustion flow problems, which includes the associated algorithmic/mathematical development and software implementation.  A new method - the Wavelet Element Method - is introduced based on wavelet and domain decomposition methods.  The new method extends the applicability of wavelet methods to combustion problems and other viscous flow problems in more complex geometries and provides a coarse grain parallelism based on domain decomposition.  It is efficient, stable, highly accurate, and highly parallel, and it has good data locality.  Wavelets support localization in both space and frequency domain which makes adaptive grid generation possible.  Wavelet coefficients uniquely indicate the workload variation across subdomains, and parallelism in the wavelet element method comes from two levels - the level of domain decomposition and the level of parallel solution of Spline Wavelet ADI in each subdomain.\r\n\r\nFour main tasks will be performed: 1) Develop a two level parallelized wavelet element method, which combines the domain decomposition and wavelet ADI methods, to maximize parallelism, locality, and scalability. 2) Investigate interface conditions among elements (subdomains) in the context of wavelet element and investigate their effects on solution accuracy, workload balance, and communication cost. 3) Study dynamic workload balance based on wavelet coefficients on both domain decomposition level and on ADI wavelet solution in each subdomain. 4) Test the scalable parallel adaptive wavelet element methods on the Deflagration to Detonation Transition Problems for multidimensional premixed flames.\r\n\r\n",
