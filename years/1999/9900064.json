 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed program will develop a multiparameter probabilistic fracture\r\nmechanics and finite element framework for the prediction of fatigue crack\r\ngrowth in a selected grade of concrete. Fatigue crack growth experiments\r\nwill be used to establish a fracture mechanics framework for the prediction\r\nof fatigue crack growth in concrete as a function of multiple mechanical\r\ndriving forces. The results will be synthesized into a single multiparameter\r\nequation using multiple linear regression techniques. The Principal\r\nInvestigators will also use funds from the proposed program to continue\r\ntheir outreach and teaching programs to minority engineering students,\r\ninitiated with NSF support over the past few years. At the graduate level, a\r\nnew college-wide course will be introduced on Probabilistic Engineering\r\nMethods for the Analysis of Failure using examples from the Principal\r\nInvestigators' prior work on fatigue, fracture, creep, and wear of structral\r\nmaterials. The proposed program will, therefore, contribute significantly to\r\nteaching and research in the area of engineering mechanics and materials.\r\nFurthermore, it willl establish a new methodolgy for the combined assessment\r\nof the effects of multiple parameters on fatigue crack growth in concrete.\r\nThe resulting single multiparameter equation could form the basis for the\r\ndevelopment of a fracture-mechanics based approach for the prediction of\r\nfatigue crack growth in concrete structures. It could also establish a\r\nframework for future research on the effects of concrete chemistry and\r\nmicrostructure on fatigue crack growth. This could result ultimately in the\r\ndesign of concrete compositons and microstructures with better fatigue crack\r\ngrowth resistance than existing grades of concrete. The optimization of\r\nconcrete composition and microstructure could also lead eventually to lower\r\nlife cycle costs and improved durability of concrete structures and\r\ninfrastructure.\r\n\r\n",
