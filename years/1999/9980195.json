 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides continuing funding for a multi-agency effort to develop a set of enabling technology roadmaps that identify key cross-cutting advances and capabilities required to meet near and long-term goals of the U.S. manufacturing community.  This project will continue to build on the roadmapping effort of the National Academy of Engineering Next Generation Manufacturing study.  During the first phase of this effort, roadmaps were developed in three areas: information systems, modeling and simulation, and manufacturing processes and equipment.  The primary objectives of this phase are to complete the baseline roadmapping initiative including the development of a technology roadmap for enterprise integration, completion of the baseline gap analysis, development and validation of a consolidated report, and initiation of implementation.  The information produced in this effort will be published as it is produced and maintained on the Internet as a readily accessible resource for government and industry in support of strategic planning.\r\n\r\nThere has been relatively little effort or collective focus to address the technical challenges associated with the next generation of manufacturing.  Many of these challenges go beyond the capabilities of a single company or a single government agency to address.  This effort brings these parties together in a forum within which information for strategic planning can be developed and made available.  This is especially crucial in the current environment where the level of manufacturing R&D funding is declining.  The results of this project should help to provide a mechanism for agencies and industry to pool their resources in areas of mutual interest.",
