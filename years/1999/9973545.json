 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n9973545  Long  This is an award to support this investigator's shift in research focus from microbial aspects of groundwater, hazardous waste treatment and metabolism of aromatic organic substances toward microbiology of water with concentration on pathogen and indicator microbiology.  The investigator will devote a sabbatical year to working in the Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering Environmental Microbiology Laboratory at the University of North Carolina in its School of Public Health.  The work will involve study of cell culture and molecular methods as potentially applied to potential use of coliphages as source-specific indicators of contamination of water by organisms of human fecal origin.  \r\n\r\nThis proposal was determined to be consistent with the objective of Program Announcement NSF 98-160, Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE). In addition to merit review of the proposal in accord with the 1997 National Science Board criteria, consideration of the proposal leading to this award included review of the applicant's career objectives and their relevance to the proposed activity, impact of the award on her potential for academic advancement, and the relationship between the proposed activity, the research and educational environment of the institutional site for this work.  ***\r\n",
