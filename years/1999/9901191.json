 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a new dynamic supply current-based alternative\r\nto Iddq test for the next generation of ICs. The methods being investigated\r\nare primarily based on a recently developed test metric, the energy\r\nconsumption ratio (ECR). Research on the project is being conducted on\r\nthree tracks: algorithmic-test, manufacture-test and self-test. The\r\nalgorithmic track develops test generation and fault simulation algorithms\r\nfor ECR test that target the detection of specific modeled faults. The\r\nfocus is on faults that are hard to detect with or escape traditional\r\nmethods. The manufacture test track focuses on the development of\r\nfault-independent test methods for ICs. The objective is to develop methods\r\nto use ECR-based test similar to those used in practice for Idd test. The\r\nfocus is on characterizing the defect coverage achievable with ECR test and\r\nidentifying test conditions which optimize defect coverage. The aim of the\r\nself-test track is to develop a built-in self-test architecture for ECR\r\ntest. A robust dynamic current sensor is being designed and evaluated..\r\n\r\n",
