Work on colloidal crystals fabricated from microsphere dielectric particles will be continued with an emphasis on more fully understanding their defect states.  The primary new initiative in this project will be development of photopolymeric approaches for fabrication of photonic band gap structures suitable for study of linear and nonlinear optical effects and possible device applications.  This approach will employ optical microscopy in combination with laser excitation and should provide advantages over fabrication of desired photonic structures by other means.\r\n%%%\r\nPhotonic band gap crystals belong to a new class of materials in which propagation of electromagnetic waves is forbidden over a certain range of frequencies.  Ready availability of such materials would open up the possibility of many device applications, especially in the optical regime.  These include devices associated with quantum optics and the confinement and control of light such as lasers, LEDs, and microcavities.  This project is fundamental in nature but has the potential to have practical impact on photonic devices, widespread in application in modern technology.  Students participating in this project will gain strong backgrounds in optical physics and laser spectroscopy as well as condensed matter physics, in high demand in industrial and national laboratories.\r\n***\r\n",
