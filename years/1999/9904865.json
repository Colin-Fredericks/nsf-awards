 "awd_abstract_narration": "The meeting \"DNA Repair and Mutagenesis:  Mechanisms, Control and Biological Consequences\" is an American Society for Microbiology sponsored conference.  The meeting will bring together the various sub-disciplines that collectively comprise the field of DNA repair and mutagenesis.   Conferences on this subject have been held at approximately 4-year intervals since 1974 and have played a critical role in the development of this exciting area of research.  Attendance is expected to be about 500, and careful thought has been given to the choice of site and design of the program so that the participants will be able to take part in the informal interactive environment normally found only at smaller meetings.  The meeting will be international in scope, but mechanisms have been devised to encourage the participation of young investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.  The fundamental science underlying recent discoveries that important genes found in humans encode proteins similar to the bacterial E. coli helicase family will be covered in depth, with topics ranging from crystal structure of DNA repair proteins, the biochemistry of multi-protein repair systems, genetic analysis of cellular responses to DNA damage, and analysis of DNA damage checkpoint control systems.",
