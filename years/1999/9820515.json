 "awd_abstract_narration": "9820515\r\nZahn\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is a GOALI industry-university collaborative project\r\nbetween MIT and EPRI for the continued analytical, computational, and\r\nexperimental study using optical tomography measurements of high voltage\r\ninsulation, conduction, prebreakdown and breakdown characteristics in\r\ndielectrics.  The methodology uses electric field induced birefringence\r\n(Kerr effect) with an improved sensitive optical measurement system and a\r\nnew advanced mathematical formulation that allows calculation of electric\r\nfield  magnitude and direction in any electrode geometry from optical\r\nintensity measurements.  Because the physics of high voltage charge\r\ninjection and transport, prebreakdown and electrical breakdown are not known\r\nfor most metal/dielectric systems, the electric field distribution cannot be\r\ncalculated from knowledge of system geometries alone.  Optical measurements\r\nprovide a direct approach to determining electrical constitutive laws and\r\nlearning the physics of the electrical breakdown process and so offers a\r\nresearch methodology for major advances in increasing the breakdown strength\r\nof dielectric systems. \r\n\r\nThe proposed continuing research program involves both graduate and\r\nundergraduate students together with EPRI personnel to try to further\r\nunderstand charge injection, conduction, aging, degradation, prebreakdown\r\nand breakdown mechanisms in high field stressed gaseous, liquid, and solid\r\ndielectrics using new modern optical, electronic, and computer\r\ninstrumentation to give \"eyes\" inside materials to see prebreakdown and\r\nbreakdown field and charge distributions that could not be measured before.\r\nSpecific proposed work tasks are 1) Extend and complete the mathematical\r\nformulation of the Kerr effect where the applied electric field magnitude\r\nand direction change along the light path for any three dimensional\r\ngeometry; develop computational algorithms to convert measured optical\r\nsignals to electric field distributions; and to verify analysis with\r\nexperiments; 2) Develop a computer interfaced camera system with an optical\r\narray detector distributed over an area to automate sensitive Kerr\r\nmeasurement data acquisition and processing without mechanical motion; 3)\r\nPerform sensitive Kerr electro-optic field and charge mapping measurements\r\nin a well controlled and monitored test cell for various liquid/solid\r\nmaterial combinations in the volume and within the electrical double layer\r\nnear interfaces as a function of DC voltage amplitude and polarity, AC\r\nvoltage amplitude and frequency, direction of interface with respect to\r\napplied electric field, temperature, moisture, conductivity, and\r\nconcentration of moisture and trace additives; 4) Extend the sensitive Kerr\r\neffect technique and perform measurements for weakly birefringent\r\ndielectrics in pulsed, ramped, and other time varying applied electric\r\nfields; 5) Relate the results of the modelling, optical measurements, and\r\ndielectrometry measurements to a better understanding of high voltage\r\nconduction, prebreakdown and breakdown phenomena in dielectrics in order to\r\nreliably extend the operation of high voltage apparatus to higher voltages;\r\nand 6) Construct a compact optical sensor measurement system that with the\r\nhelp of EPRI personnel and contractors will be applied to electric field and\r\nspace charge measurements in an operating transformer.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
