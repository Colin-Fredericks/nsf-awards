 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis grant provides funding for the innovative application of wavelets in computer aided design and manufacture.  Specifically, the research will address the use of wavelets for tool path planning in numerically controlled machining of complex free form surfaces, surface reconstruction in reverse engineering applications, developing interactive sculpting interfaces, and process monitoring in machining.  Wavelets are a mathematical tool for hierarchically decomposing functions.  They allow a function to be described in terms of coarse overall shape and finer detail.  This property of wavelets permits multi-resolution analysis and is fundamental to the approach used in this research.  The research involves the identification of the appropriate class of wavelets for each application, and the development of tools and techniques to manipulate them.   Performance measures include the generation of gouge free tool paths and uniform chip loads in numerical controlled machining, accuracy and fidelity of reverse engineered models, ease of use and intuitiveness of the sculpting interface, and reliability and discriminatory power in process monitoring.\r\n\tIf successful, the results of this research will improve both design quality and the quality of the machined product.  It is expected that the accuracy of machined parts will improve, particularly in the case of complex free form surfaces.  Part design is expected to improve because of more intuitive design interfaces, and design time will be reduced because of enhanced conceptual design capability.  Prototypes and models can be quickly produced through reverse engineering, and machining processes can be efficiently monitored.\r\n",
