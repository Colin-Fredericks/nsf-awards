 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972071\r\nNg\r\n\r\nIn this project new and more sophisticated tunneling experiments will be performed on high-Tc superconductors.  Specifically, Zero Bias Conductance Peak (ZBCP) and pseudogap measurements will be performed on superconductors.  This project consists of three parts.  The first part consists of the study of the response of ZBCP under different experimental conditions such as 1) the tunneling direction, 2) the presence of both magnetic and non-magnetic barrier impurities, and 3) the presence of microwave radiation. The second part involves careful measurements on the pseudogap found in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8-d (BSCCO).  The dependence of the pseudogap on the oxygen content, magnetic field, and the temperature will be investigated.  The relationship between the dip feature commonly observed in the superconducting state and the pseudogap will also be investigated by means of high Tc superconductor - to - high Tc superconductor tunneling.    In the third part of the project,  two new experiments will be performed to study the ZBCP and also the pseudogap state in common.  The first experiment is to search for the occurrence of Andreev reflection in underdoped BSCCO when T > Tc.  If there are pre-form pairs in the pseudogap phase, then Andreev reflection will produce a weak ZBCP in the tunneling conductance curve.  The other technique is to use colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) material as a counter electrode.  The spin polarized electrons will depress  the height of ZBCP.  These spin-polarized electrons will also suppress the pseudogap if the pseudogap is related to the pair pre-formation in underdoped high Tc superconductors.   \r\n%%%\r\nIt is now well established that high-temperature superconductors demonstrate many interesting properties that do not appear in other conventional (ordinary) superconductors. Ordinary superconductors operate at only very low temperatures yet are already used in many advanced technologies. There is a great effort underway to improve the behavior of high-temperature superconductors to allow them to be more easily and more economically integrated into technological devices, such as the transmission of electrical power over long distances, energy storage devices, electric motors, etc.  These applications do depend, however, on a better understanding of high-temperature superconductivity.  A satisfactory fundamental theory of high-temperature superconductivity is not yet available and this research is directed to the performance of critical experiments to assist in the establishment of an acceptable theory.  This research will involve graduate as well as undergraduate students and postdoctoral research associates who will thereby receive training in one of the forefront areas of contemporary condensed-matter physics and materials science.  This training will prepare them for productive careers in the technological work force during the 21st Century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
