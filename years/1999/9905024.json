 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to conceptualize objects, events, and states is central to human\r\ncognition.  When people plan and make decisions, they conceptualize future\r\nevents; when people recall a previous experience, they conceptualize past\r\nevents; when people understand language, they conceptualize the meaning of a\r\nspeaker's utterance.  Theories of knowledge often assume that when people\r\nconceptualize something, they conceptualization it an isolated abstract\r\nmanner.  Thus, when people conceptualize a chair, they conceptualize it as\r\nan isolated and abstract object; or when people conceptualize a purchase, they\r\nconceptualize it as an unsituated abstract event.  The proposed research aims\r\ninstead to demonstrate that conceptualizations are situated, first, in a\r\nphysical environment, and second, with respect to the perceiver's cognitive\r\nperspective.  Thus, when people conceptualize a chair, they situate it in a\r\nparticular setting (e.g., a kitchen), and they adopt a cognitive perspective\r\ntoward it (e.g., standing on it to change a light bulb).  Besides including\r\nsettings and cognitive perspectives, situated conceptualizations represent\r\nfocal entities in a context-appropriate manner.  When people conceptualize a\r\nchair in a specific situation, they don't represent the chair abstractly,\r\ninstead they represent a specific type of chair appropriate for that situation\r\n(e.g., a kitchen chair in a kitchen).  Three lines of research examine whether\r\nconceptualizations are situated.  The first uses the property generation and\r\nproperty verification tasks to establish situational content in\r\nconceptualizations.  The second uses the false memory task to demonstrate that\r\nlearned material is typically situated, and that the situations inferred at\r\nencoding later produce reconstructive memory errors at retrieval.  The third\r\nassesses the hypothesis that abstract concepts, such as truth and freedom,\r\ndepend critically on their meanings for situationswithout situations these\r\nconcepts are difficult to understand.  This research is highly relevant to\r\napplications in education and training.  Should it demonstrate that\r\nconceptualizations are situated, it would motivate instructional methods that\r\nsituate learned material.  Rather than trying to instill abstract non-situated\r\nconcepts in students and trainees, instilling situated conceptualizations may\r\nprove much more effective.  The proposed research has much potential for\r\nsupporting and informing these efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
