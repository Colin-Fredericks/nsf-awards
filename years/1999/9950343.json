 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to transform the biochemistry laboratory into a dynamic interactive learning environment utilizing the recent advances in the area of structure function relationships. Recognizing the value of hands-on experiences in making women and male students active participants in their own education, the goal of this project is threefold: to have students experience the structural function relationship of biomolecules through innovative laboratories and class work, to expose students to modem biochemical laboratory equipment and technology in order to better prepare the info post-graduate endeavors, and to provide the students with a well-founded knowledge of experimentation in biochemistry. Specifically, an interactive biochemistry laboratory will be designed around structure based learning activities that will ultimately lead to an understanding of biochemical function. Each group of experiments will be mimic a research setting in which the experiments may take many weeks to fully develop. Upon completion of a section, the students will be required to write a paper in the format of a biochemical journal. The first section will focus on over expression, purification and partial characterization of an enzyme utilizing fundamental techniques in biochemistry. The next section will explore more sophisticated structure function relationships of proteins. Students will be exposed to a high technology UV-Visible spectrophotorneter to gather primary kinetic data to be compared to the conceptual data they will gather using two Silicon Graphic workstations. The final section will focus on the structure function relationship of nucleic acids. Though this proposal is not targeting women or minorities, a number of studies have suggested that hands on experiences in a realistic setting have aided in the retention of women in science programs. Since biochemistry is the most popular elective among chemistry students, and is becoming more necessary for pre-professional students, revisions of this course will influence a broad variety of students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
