The material will be presented in a format of 10 class periods of inquiry-based instruction, which could replace or accompany the treatment of developmental biology in existing high school textbooks; BSCS will use the module in all three of its BSCS texts.  Four general topics of Developmental Biology will be covered:  the development of individual organisms, development and evolution, development and the methods of science, and personal and social implications of developmental biology.  Motion footage of development of several species, 3-D graphics (which can be manipulated by students), simulations of modern and classic experiments, links to external databases, as well as basic text material will be incorporated in the CD-ROM.  Supplemental material for teachers will be supplied.  Students will be presented with printed material, including hands-on activities and laboratory investigations, which will be integrated with the CD-ROM content.  The 20-month project will involve BSCS, the Eccles Institute of Human Genetics at the University of Utah, and Learning Systems Consultants (who will be subcontracted to create the CD-ROM).  BSCS has submitted a well-planned and time-tested development and evaluation process.  BSCS and the University of Utah will distribute the CD-ROM via a commercial publisher.\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n",
