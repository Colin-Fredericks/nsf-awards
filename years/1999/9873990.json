 "awd_abstract_narration": "William Jorgensen is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical studies of organic reactions in solution.  Jorgensen will extend his previous work in this area in three new directions: 1) he will seek an improved computational model for liquid water that can reproduce experimental densities over large ranges of temperature and pressure; 2) he will develop Monte Carlo simulation approaches using linear response theory to perform rapid prediction of molecular properties including free energies of hydration and octanol / water partition coefficients; 3) he will seek to improve the methodology for combined quantum and molecular mechanics calculations including the extension of current semi-empirical molecular orbital techniques to second row atoms containing d electrons.  These techniques will be applied to several organic reactions including: 1) biosynthesis of lanosterol; 2) Michael additions of thiolates; and 3) halide selectivity for calixpyrroles.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for the elucidation of molecular-level effects of solvation on reaction rates, intermolecular interactions and host-guest binding in solution, and the influence of solvation on the structures and reactivity of molecules. The theoretical studies closely parallel and complement experimental work on the optimization of organic reactions and on the development of catalysts, selective receptors for organic molecules including drugs and metabolites, materials with novel properties, and molecular devices. \r\n",
