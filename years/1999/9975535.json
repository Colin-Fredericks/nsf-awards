 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Professor Kathy Rowlen at the University of Colorado-Boulder is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division and the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research.  The research will focus on the relationship between the nanostructure of metal particles and films and their optical properties. The first part will be a study of the Raman scattering enhancement (SERS) of silver nanoparticles using near-field scanning optical microscopy. The particles will be prepared by photochemical reduction of solid silver halides via near-field excitation or by reduction of silver halides at the scanning tunneling microscope tip. Once conditions have been established  for formation of an optimally SERS- active particle, systematic studies of the relationship of particle size and shape to optical properties will be conducted. The second part of the research will be a determination of the chemical and physical parameters that affect nucleation, growth and stability of copper, gold and silver thin metal films on nonmetallic surfaces such as silicon, silica, mica and alumina. Surfaces will be characterized by atomic force microscopy and optical properties of the films determined by uv-vis spectroscopy and SERS. Computational modeling of surface nucleation and film growth will complement experimental studies.\r\n",
