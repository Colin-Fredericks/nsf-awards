In this research these problems are attacked by means of a series of in situ electron microscopy experiments in which the properties of individual, well characterized nanotubes are measured.  These properties include the electronic transport, field emission, electrostatic potentials of the electrically charged nanotubes, and elastic constants.  The feasibility of such measurements have been demonstrated by a series of preliminary experiments which include (i) the making and breaking of electrical contacts involving nanotubes; (ii) in situ field emission; (iii) phase contrast effects of the charged nanotubes; and (iv) observations of electrically induced mechanical resonances.  The latter effect suggests a new approach towards nanomechanics.  This research offers many opportunities for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral research associates in a field which stands at the forefront of contemporary condensed matter physics and materials sciences.\r\n%%%\r\nCarbon nanotubes are nearly perfect graphitic tubes with remarkable properties among which are their exceptional mechanical strength, high current carrying capabilities, possible hydrogen storage capabilities, and others.  In order to characterize these properties and to discover new ones it is essential that carbon tubes be studied individually. The principal investigator has developed the required methods for such studies.  This research offers opportunities for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral research associates in an advanced technological field that offers many employment opportunities during the 21st Century.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
