 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main mathematical goal of this proposal is the\r\nstudy of parameter space for polynomial diffeomorphisms\r\nin the complex domain. In particular, the PI will \r\nconsider the complex Henon map. The Henon map is the \r\nsimplest model of sophisticated dynamics in two higher\r\ndimension dynamics. With the aid of the holomorphic \r\nstructure, complex dynamics can help bridge the separation\r\nexisting between theoretical real dynamical systems and\r\nexperimental dynamical systems. The proposer plans to\r\ncontinue studying the structure of attracting orbits.\r\nShe will also study the analytical and geometrical \r\nproperties of the dynamics that occur in the vicinity of \r\ncertain types of bifurcations for complex maps.\r\nThe dynamics  close to some types of bifurcations\r\nis  rich and varied. Strange attractors, infinitely many \r\nbasins, and cascade of horseshoes are coexisting and they\r\nare still not well-understood. Gavosto will  study these\r\nissues using a combination of analytic tools from several \r\ncomplex variables and  immersive mathematical visualization \r\ntechniques. The PI and collaborators will continue to \r\ndevelop  computer visualization tools based on structured \r\nsets of textured surfaces. These tools allow real time \r\ninteraction with complicated sets of higher dimensional\r\ndata.  The PI  will incorporate undergraduate and high school\r\nstudents as research assistants in the visualization of data \r\nfrom research projects in complex  dynamics, mathematical \r\nbiological models, and crystal engineering. \r\n\r\nThe subject of dynamical systems models the evolution of\r\nphenomena that change over time. Numerous algebraic equations\r\nwhich have no solutions on the real numbers can be easily solved \r\nin the complex numbers. Along the same lines, the study of \r\ndynamical systems using complex numbers adds degrees of freedom \r\n(space dimensions)  and permits the visualization of hidden \r\nstructures. Theoretical and computational progress in dynamical\r\nsystems will permit the decoding of intricate patterns and\r\nchaotic behavior in a variety of applications. The development\r\nof technology in the last decade has produced an explosion of data. \r\nThe accurate and relevant visualization of large sets of \r\ndata presents many challenges in the mathematical and physical\r\nsciences. New visualization tools will be very useful to help \r\nbridge the gap between disciplines. The outreach activities \r\ninvolving high school students and teachers in this project will\r\nprovide a way to integrate the community into the development of\r\nscience and in the understanding of its consequences.\r\nAs used in this project, technology is an exceptional medium for\r\nintroducing students early in their studies to new areas of\r\nresearch in math and science. For these reasons, the project is expected \r\nto have a broad multidisciplinary impact not only in the sciences but also\r\npossibly in the way the sciences are taught at the High School level and above. This project is jointly funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
