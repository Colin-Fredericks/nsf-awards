 "awd_abstract_narration": "9815094\r\nYakovenko\r\nThis grant supports research devoted to the theory of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) organic conductors and related materials in strong magnetic fields.  The study focuses on the Bechgaard salts, whose chemical formula is (TMTSF)2X, where TMTSF is tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene and X represents various inorganic anions.  These materials demonstrate an astonishingly rich variety of physical properties and states: metallic, insulating, superconductive (possibly triplet), charge-and spin-density-wave states, antiferromagnetism, the spin-Peierls state, and the state of Hubbard paramagnetic insulator.  A strong magnetic field induces the cascade of phase transitions between magnetic-field-induced spin-density-waves (FISDW), which exhibit the quantum Hall effect.  It was discovered recently that the magnetic field also induces an insulating behavior in the normal state at a higher temperature without any apparent phase transition, possibly by opening an energy gap in the charge channel.  At lower temperatures, behavior of the system becomes very sensitive to the orientation of the magnetic field.  Rotations of the magnetic field in three mutually perpendicular planes produce striking oscillatory effects, some of them compatible and some incompatible with the conventional theory of metals.  One of these rotations makes the system metallic at the so-called magic angles and insulating otherwise.  The organic materials are interesting not only by themselves, but also for conceptual connections with the conventional quantum Hall effect and high temperature superconductivity.\r\n\r\nThe research can be divided into three groups with each containing several topics.  The work on high temperature superconductivity extends the research on organic materials and is not a major subject in the proposal itself.  The three groups of study are: (1) Q1D organic conductors in the normal state; (2) Q1D organic conductors in the FISDW state; (3) high-temperature superconductors.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports theoretical research on the fascinating properties of organic materials in the presence of very strong magnetic fields such as those available at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.   These materials exhibit a number of different states which, while interesting in their own right, may also shed light on topics of great current interest in condensed matter and materials physics.  These topics include the quantum Hall effect, high temperature superconductivity, and spin-and charge-density-wave states.\r\n***\r\n",
