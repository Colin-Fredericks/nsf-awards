 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to provide three integrative approaches as didactic tools to the science and education communities for the integration of biologic research and elementary education. These approaches will model the training of graduate students but will focus on K-9 teachers in learning novel leading-edge technologies, in applying these technologies to the solution of physiologic problems, and in attending courses and participating in laboratory meetings. The first approach will be to adopt and develop technologies for examination of gene function in mouse kidney. The initial technology will be to develop and standardize an isolated kidney perfusion system for the mouse. Since there is currently no such system for the mouse coupled with the availability of several knock-outs, renin expression and regulation under a variety of physiologic conditions can be investigated to provide novel insights. The next will be to develop an isolated renin-secreting cell preparation in the mouse following perfusion of the kidney. This isolated cell system will allow direct investigation of genes involved in signalling, trafficking and secretion at the cellular level in the mouse, a desirable goal which has been difficult to achieve before now. The final phase of the mouse kidney work will be to isolate and standardize the subcellular components of the renin secretory pathway in the mouse following perfusion of the kidney and isolation of the renin-secreting cells. In addition, this project will attempt to assemble DNA microarrays of the genes of the mouse renin-secreting cells. By hybridizing these arrays with probes corresponding at first to signalling, trafficking and secretion genes in yeast, global gene expression patterns under a wide variety of experimental conditions can be investigated. All four technologies are intricately linked and will be developed and coordinated during the first year of the project. The second approach will be to conduct a number of physiologic application of the technologies in mouse. The third will be to offer a formal molecular cell physiology course focusing on the physiologic application and hold regular weekly laboratory meetings. K-9 teachers will be trained to master these technologies in an ongoing long-term apprentice-like mentoring relationship. But the development and coordination of these four technologies will be most fully realized within the biological application and service components of this project. These components will focus on enhancing our understanding of signalling, trafficking and secretion genes in the mouse renin system, but they will also focus on enriching and empowering the K-9 teachers who would have gained hands-on physiological research experiences to share with their students as they conduct their own classroom science activities. This approach will provide data to members of the community with which to formulate hypotheses about renin expression and its regulation, particularly since renin regulation has been shown to be different from most other secretory proteins. The biological application component will allow the K-9 teachers to participate in hands-on physiologic research on a significant biological problem This project will make maximal use of the synergism among the three approaches in creating a scientific learning environment where the K-9 teachers can acquire the habits of mind gained from the communal excitement in leading-edge scientific research that will be hands-on and sustained. The central hypothesis is that elementary school teachers trained in such an environment over the long term are more likely to become life-long learners of science and therefore better able to communicate the excitement of science to their students in their classrooms. The project will be executed by a team of collaborators from four institutions: University of Massachusetts (John Fray, PI, Jack Leonard, Co-PI), Goddard School of Science and Technology (Joan Merrill, Co-Investigator), and Sullivan Middle School and University Park School, all in Worcester, Massachusetts. Goddard (K-6), Sullivan (7-9), and University Park (7-9) schools are situated in the same urban high crime underrepresented minority neighborhoods plagued by drugs, prostitution, and random shootings\r\n",
