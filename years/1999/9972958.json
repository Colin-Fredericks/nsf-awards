The research will use multiple scattering theories to analyze data from surface spectroscopies sensitive to the short-range or long-range order of materials.\r\n\r\nAn important research thrust is to use a new N2-scaling iterative multiple scattering theory, developed in the last grant period, to analyze photoelectron diffraction (PD) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) data.  The new method is orders of magnitude faster than existing \"exact\" methods, but just as accurate.  By being able to include up to 700 atoms/unit-cell in a supercell slab calculation - the current limit with exact methods is approximately 50 atoms/unit-cell - the new method can address quantitatively a host of interesting problems relating to layer growth and epitaxy, or commensurate-incommensurate transitions, etc.  \r\n\r\nA second area of focus is the development of direct methods for structural determination.  An important goal of surface structural analysis is to be able to invert electron diffraction data to directly produce atomic coordinates in real space.  This goal has eluded solution for over 40 years.  The PI and others have demonstrated that inversion of measured electron diffraction spectra can produce direct atomic positions in the surface region.  In close collaboration with experimental groups, the holographic inversion method will be applied to solve structures of unknown surfaces and interfaces.      \r\n\r\nFinally, a third focus of this research is to develop a multiple scattering theory to accurately analyze reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) intensity oscillations and rocking curves.  RHEED is the technique of choice in most MBE chambers to study growth modes and transitional or high-temperature structures.  At energies of 10 KeV or above, the methods developed for LEED or PD are no longer practical.  A multiple scattering theory of RHEED will be developed capable of handling unit cells containing 100 atoms or more.  With this new method, simulations of large terrace-sized RHEED intensity oscillations will be undertaken and compared to RHEED measurements and observations of island sizes by in situ STM.  The aim is to establish optimal scattering conditions for the quantitative usage of RHEED oscillations as an indicator of layer completion.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports theoretical research which pursues a quantitative understanding of the structure of surfaces and interfaces, a field of research which is fundamental to the understanding of a host of important scientific questions in materials research.  The research will use multiple scattering theories to analyze data from surface spectroscopies sensitive to the short-range or long-range order of materials.  These newly developed techniques will then be applied to a number of important problems involving the physics of surface structure and its growth and evolution.\r\n***\r\n",
