The proposed research is a new partnership between two professors early in their careers and draws on complementary expertise of the two researchers. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research is a comprehensive approach to the investigation and elucidation of the microbial synthesis of natural-synthetic block copolymers .   The research project will focus on two aspects: the elucidation of the enzyme system involved in the block copolymerization and the study of the material characteristics of the novel block copolymers, with exciting potential in the field of production of novel materials from renewable resources.  There is a growing demand for novel materials serving very specific purposes.  The quest for new materials focuses increasingly on environmental compatibility, most often biodegradability of the materials.  Environmental compatibility includes the production of new materials from renewable resources, environmentally friendly production, and hazard-free disposal and degradations of the materials after their use is exhausted.  This research into PHA-b-PEG copolymers will provide novel materials addressing these requirements. \r\n",
