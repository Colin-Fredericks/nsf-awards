Experiments performed using a femtosecond laser allow scientists to study ultrafast phenomena.  Femtosecond pulses are ideal light source for nonlinear optical research.  Funds from the Major Research Instrumentation program will be used to acquire a femtosecond laser system (50-fs pulse width, 82-MHz repetition rate, tunable from 360 to 450 nm and from 720 to 950 nm).  Six faculty members at two colleges of New Mexico State University (NMSU) will use this instrument for research in the emerging technology of photonics, which promises to acquire, store, process, and transmit information much faster than today's computers.  The research projects in which this laser will be used include materials with high optical nonlinearity, laser emission from microcavities filled with nanostructured silver aggregates, and to study the ultrafast all-optical switch developed at the Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of NMSU.  This state-of-the-art laser will be used by many of the 6 undergraduate students, 21 graduate students and 2 visiting scientists at the investigators research groups (6 Hispanic and 6 women) in their thesis projects.  Other students at NMSU (a Carnegie I research institution, a land-grant educational institution, and a minority institution) will also benefit directly in their education through the use of this instrument at two laboratory courses designed for graduate students and senior undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nA femtosecond laser will be acquired with Major Research Instrumentation program funds.  This instrument will be used by six researchers in projects on photonic materials, which is important in information technology.  The instrumentation will have a significant impact on the research infrastructure at New Mexico State University, which is a minority institution.\r\n",
