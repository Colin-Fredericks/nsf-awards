 "awd_abstract_narration": "This standard award is for support of a PostDoc to work with the PI on his ongoing research whose objective is to apply advanced techniques from machine learning and information theory to study the problem of protein structure prediction.  The techniques to be used include the utilization of intelligent ways of constructing useful composite attributes, and the dynamic reallocation of search effort as better approaches become recognized.  Such techniques cannot be used blindly, but must be tailored to the special requirements of scientific discovery.  The results of this work should have broad applicability to many aspects of automated and semi-automated scientific discovery, but the specific focus - understanding protein folding - is in itself extremely important to both protein chemists and society, because it will open new opportunities for research and medicine.  Also, demonstrating a general technique for computer-aided scientific model design should help scientists in a variety  of scientific disciplines, as they record more data than they can meaningfully analyze manually.",
