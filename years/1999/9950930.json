 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first introductory biology course for science majors at NLU focuses on basic chemistry, metabolism, genetics, molecular biology, and evolution.  A laboratory course complements the lecture but does not generate sufficient enthusiasm, leading to poor performance, high drop rates, and low retention rates for new biology majors.  Therefore, to enhance research skills, quantitative measurements, and data presentation, a new portfolio-style laboratory notebook incorporates writing assignments, imaging, and data graphs.  Instead of quizzes and fact-based exams, grading is based on achieving goals for the notebook portfolio (using rubrics), and a multimedia presentation of a semester-long group project.  This conforms to current national efforts to improve science education through the use of authentic assessment and performance assessment techniques.  This project has been adapted as a hybrid from activities used today to stimulate undergraduate biology in Beyond Bio 101 (HHMI) and from suggestions of how to incorporate writing in courses from \"Writing in the Total Curriculum\" (RH Weiss, 1980) and \"Writing to Learn:  curricular strategies for nursing and other disciplines\" (GP Poirrier, 1997).  Both Biology and English majors serve as in-lab mentors and evaluators to assist the instructors, providing a new cross-disciplinary collaboration between Biology and English.  Computer-interfaced desktop cameras, attachable to microscopes, provide  a range of magnifications used to incorporate imaging and quantitative measurements of scale.  Traditional activities are supplemented with open-ended research and observations to stimulate independent thought.  Real-time data acquisition to the computers from instruments like spectrophotometers and balances enhances technology skills.  Long-term projects that consider aquatic microcosms and fern genetics foster enthusiasm for scientific inquiry, collaboration, and data synthesis.  The use of nontraditional, cooperative learning strategies provides strong socializing effects.  To assist students further, special tutoring and interactive software is available through the University's Writing Center.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
