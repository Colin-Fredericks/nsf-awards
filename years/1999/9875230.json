 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deborah Evans is supported by a CAREER award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to extend current quantum dynamics methodological and massively parallel computing techniques to enable realistic simulations on electron transport through polymer films.  The numerical studies focus on the underlying mechanism of electron transport relevant on the microscopic scale for the design of nanoscale devices.  Evans teaching plan is to establish a summer minority outreach program in high performance computing and chemical physics for a small number of undergraduate students.  She will develop curricula in chemical physics and high performance computing to enhance the numerical capabilities of chemistry students in applying computational techniques to solve fundamental physics problems.\r\n\r\nTechnological advances have made the manufacture of electronic devices on the nano- and molecular scale possible.  This has led to an increased activity in experimental studies of simple models for these devices, including electron transfer studies on thin films and polymeric materials.  Transport properties in complex materials is challenging because electron behavior should be treated quantum mechanically, but an exact solution of the problem including the environment cannot be achieved quantum mechanically.  Evans is employing massively parallel computing techniques which treat environmental effects at the classical and semiclassical level to enable realistic systems of reasonable size to be studied.\r\n",
