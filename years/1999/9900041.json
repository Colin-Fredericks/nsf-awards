 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multidisciplinary research project, which is supported jointly by Analytical and Surface Chemistry in the Chemistry Division, Solid State Chemistry in the Division of Materials Research, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, concerns the organic-semiconductor interface.  Using well-established methods of synthetic organic chemistry, primarily Diels-Alder and related chemistry, Professor Bent and her colleagues at Stanford University are fashioning organic-semiconductor interfaces.  Elaboration of the organic interface is carried out, following the anchoring of reactive species on the Si(100) or Ge(100) surface.  The work explores the mechanism of this chemistry, and considers the use of lithographic methods to extend these ideas to the construction of organic based electronic devices.  These hybrid organic-semiconductor materials show great promise for application in the next generation of electronic and optoelectronic devices.\r\n\r\nThe interface between organic thin films and semiconductor substrates is becoming more and more important as state of the art organic based electronic devices are conceived and implemented.  This research project focuses on understanding the chemistry of this important interface.  Professor Bent and her coworkers at Stanford University are developing this chemistry based on well-known methods of double bond activation, and are using this approach to develop more robust processing methods for this promising generation of new electronic devices. \r\n\r\n",
