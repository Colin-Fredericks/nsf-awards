Nahmod\r\n\r\nAbstract: Nahmod's project aims at studying specific problems in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations that arise when smoothness conditions on the domain or the operations are relaxed to conform with a more natural physical setting. The first part concentrates on the study of the boundary unique continuation property for the Laplace operator on irregular domains. This property is a boundary version of the classical interior unique continuation property for elliptic operators, and is closely related to results on nodal sets of eigenfunctions. Basically nothing is known for nonsmooth-nonconvex-domains. This project will investigate whether or not Lipschitz domains have the boundary unique continuation property. It is first approached by considering a special case, the Bang-Bang Principle of control theory, which is of interest in its own right. The second part focuses on the study of bilinear operators associated to nonsmooth symbols that arise in the context of compensated compactness and are also related to Calderon's commutators. Nonlinearity in certain partial differential equations prevents direct use of weak continuity arguments to ensure the convergence of approximating solutions. Compensated compactness was developed to overcome this difficulty by exploiting cancellation properties and a priori bounds of certain associated nonlinear quantities, usually bilinear. The aim of this project is to establish a comprehensive criterion in one dimension for bilinear operators with nonsmooth symbols to map into some Hardy space. The approach is via a delicate use of time-frequency analysis, as pioneered by C. Fefferman and later successfully exploited by Lacey and Thiele. A concurrent aim of the project is to both develop and gain a greater understanding of the ideas and decompositions involved in the analysis with the goal of making these techniques more readily applicable in other specific contexts. \r\n\r\nPartial differential equations, the ultimate object of study in Nahmod's project, are the mathematical models of the laws governing many phenomena in our physical world. The role of mathematical analysis is to study the behaviour of their solutions, provide the tools to extract quantitative and qualitative information about them, and lay the foundations upon which methods to approximate the solutions with reasonable accuracy are developed. Time-frequency analysis, one of the key methods to be employed by Nahmod, consists in decomposing complex objects into basic building blocks (via a collection of \"modulated waveforms\") that are localized and easy to understand, and then piecing them back together in a straightforward manner. A time-frequency analysis of a problem can be likened to a musical score. The modulated waveforms (the notes) have four attributes: amplitude (loudness), scale (duration), frequency (pitch) and position (instant it is played). The object that the full \"time-frequency composition\" portrays might, for example, be speech, a radar signal, or a fingerprint, but might also be a more abstract oscillatory expression arising in optics, acoustic scattering, and wave propagation problems. This type of analysis is closely related to the theory of wavelets. Its impact is both theoretical and computational for its potential to implement the ideas developed in harmonic analysis to produce fast computational algorithms for operations which, due to their nonlocal nature, are otherwise expensive to compute numerically.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
