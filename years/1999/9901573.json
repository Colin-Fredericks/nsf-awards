The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Mary L. Leech with twelve months of support to work with Dr. Martin Menzies at Royal Holloway, the University of London, Egham, Surrey, UK, and for twelve months at Stanford University in Stanford, California, to work with Dr. Trevor R. Ireland.\r\nThese researchers will study ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism using an ion microprobe, laser-ablation, and fission-track thermochronology to produce pressure-temperature-time paths for the polar Urals.   Mineral phases such as coesite and diamond represent stability fields under extraordinarily high pressure and an investigation of their environment of formation in the polar Urals would add significantly to our understanding of plate collision mechanisms and environments.\r\nRoyal Holloway has the necessary geochemical instruments for this work, and is conveniently located to permit side trips to Edinburgh and Oslo, Norway to consult with other researchers working on this area of research.  Dr. Menzies has experience into larger scale tectonic and continental growth processes.  Stanford has been a center for ultrahigh pressure metamorphism and will be an ideal place to continue the work started in the UK.  It also has a new SHRIMP-RG ion microprobe, which will be used to perform analyses to complete the project.\r\n***\r\n",
