 "awd_abstract_narration": "An on-line virtual reality research laboratory will be created as mirror image of the College Coastal Studies Center. The virtual reality laboratory will be an educational tool designed to integrate technology into the process of learning. The virtual reality laboratory combines a topologically accurate 3-D Web-based exploration of a real research site while providing access to a multi-dimensional database. The virtual laboratory will teach students how to interact with and use large amounts of information while making interdisciplinary inquires about real world problems. Visitors in the virtual world have 3-D representations known as avatars. Several students can simultaneously use the virtual world where they can \"see\" and communication with each other's avatars. This capability provides for several educational opportunities. Students can collaborate to solve problems by interacting with the databases, in real time. Students can interact with teachers or experts from anywhere in the real World while they are in the virtual world. Anyone with a computer and an Internet connection can enter this virtual world, thus increasing access for the disabled or students without field research opportunities. This will be a valuable tool for teachers anywhere in the real World by developing student interest in using technology tools to understand complex interrelationships in the environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
