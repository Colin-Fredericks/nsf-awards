The overall goal is to identify and characterize the ground states of these materials. Specifically, a dilatometer will be used to measure the thermal expansion and magnetostriction of the magnetic material YBNi2B2C and the non-magnetic superconductor LuNi2B2C.  A comparison of the resulting measurements for these two materials allows the separation of the magnetic component of the Yb compound.  Furthermore, undergraduate students will participate in this research.  Most of the work will be done on the campus of Occidental College, with the remainder at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.  The undergraduate students will fully engage in this project and gain first hand experience to do research and interact with scientists in a major research environment.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research project will be conducted with undergraduate students at Occidental College and at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.  The research focuses on the experimental determination of certain magnetic and superconducting properties of two members of a family of nickel-boron compounds.  The results will contribute to the understanding of superconductivity.  Moreover, this project has a very strong educational component.  The undergraduate participants will gain experience in one of the current forefront areas of condensed matter physics.  In addition to their work done at Occidental College their presence at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory will give them experience in research conducted in a major research environment, where they will interact with experienced scientists as research colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
