Although originally applied to hardware systems, finite-state verification (FSV) techniques (e.g. model checking) are emerging as the front-runner in the race to automate high-quality assurance of modern software.  To apply FSV techniques, one must create a finite-state transition system model of the software system's behavior.  The model and a property to be verified are given to a FSV tool, and verification is performed by mechanically enumerating all reachable states in the transition system and checking that the property holds at each state.  Currently, finite-state models of software must be created by hand. Hand-coding complex language features such as parameterized generic modules, procedures, threads, and dynamically created program data and threads of control is tedious and error-prone, and will not scale to large production systems.\r\n\r\nIn other National Science Foundation supported work, techniques, methodologies, and tools are being developed for automatically constructing finite-state models of software using abstract interpretation and partial evaluation technology.  The research associate is coordinating the development of a model construction tool suite for Java software.  The associate is working closely with the PI and Co-PIs on both the theoretical and implementation aspects of the project and is responsible for supervising the implementation work of junior graduate students.  These tasks provide an avenue for the associate's growth in performing and leading foundational and experimental research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
