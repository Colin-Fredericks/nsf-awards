The deployment of instruments to measure deformation will include borehole strainmeters, Global Positioning System (GPS) dual frequency receivers, as well as improved data gathering capabilities for measuring strain with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (INSAR) techniques. The strain measurements will focus on the San Francisco Bay area and extend southward along the Central San Andreas Fault system (the \"boundary\" between the North American plate and the Pacific plate). Because the time scale for deformation along the plate boundary ranges over eight orders of magnitude, from seconds to decades, the integrated instrumental approach taken here is the only one capable of providing a broadband coverage from strain transients to slow creep. The team in charge of the project includes scientists from the University of California at Berkeley and San Diego, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The data gathered by the instrument system will be made freely available to the scientific community and will be valuable to earth scientists and engineers studying earthquakes as well as for basic investigating fundamental Earth processes.\r\n***\r\n",
