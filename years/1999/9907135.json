 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the governments of cities in many developing nations have increasingly encouraged the involvement of community-based organizations (CBOs) in the delivery of housing in low-income areas.  Studies of CBOs have diverged, however, regarding the roles that these organizations play, particularly with respect to the degree to which see CBOs enable poor residents to participate in markets and the extent to which CBOs are controlled by the urban poor as opposed to mechanisms of control by other groups.  This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the ways that social relationships in the community and the political and economic structure of local land markets affects the form, function, and effectiveness of CBOs in different locales.  The project will consist of an extensive set of comparative studies in different communities in the Manila metropolitan area in the Philippines.  Detailed analyses will be made of five CBOs, with a survey of CBOs in about 80 communities providing a broader framework for generalization of conclusions.  This project will provide empirical information about the factors that facilitate collective action and formation of CBOs in low-income neighborhoods as well as the interplay of internal and external factors that affect the character and success of these organizations.  In addition to its fundamental research value, this study will provide new insights of use to planners and community leaders seeking to develop policies and programs to provide more and better housing for poorer residents of the world's cities.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\n",
