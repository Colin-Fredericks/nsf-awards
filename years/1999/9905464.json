This project will develop a three-year program (1998-2000) of summer research experiences involving eight undergraduate interns per year, with emphasis on (but not restricted to) recruitment of students from Historially Black and Historically Minority Colleges and Universities (HBCUs and HMCUs).  Participants will assist research mentors from CMEA in laboratory and field work, as well as develop and execute an independent research project with the direction and guidance of their mentor. Participants will be involved in projects ranging from the effects of anthropogenic stressors on the status and health of coral reefs, seagrass ecosystems, and fishery resources to the integration of science and management.   On-site field trips to management agencies will also be made to heighten the awareness of the type of research needed for effective management of coastal resources, as well as to introduce participants to non-academic career options.\r\n\r\n",
