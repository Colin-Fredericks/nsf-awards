The virus DNA is contained inside the capsid. Infection with HSV-1 begins when the virus membrane binds to the cytoplasmic membrane of a host cell and fuses with it. Fusion results in introduction of the DNA-containing capsid (the nucleocapsid) into the cytoplasm where it migrates to the nucleus and injects its DNA through a nuclear pore. Virus DNA is then replicated and capsids are assembled in the nucleus. Further virus maturation includes packaging of DNA into a capsid which is enveloped at the inner nuclear membrane before exiting the host cell, a process that may proceed by de-envelopment at the outer nuclear membrane followed by re-envelopment in the cytoplasm. Packaging of HSV-1 DNA into a capsid is required for virus growth. The process involves participation of capsids, concatemeric DNA and the products of eight virus genes, UL6, UL15, UL17, UL21, UL25, UL28, UL32 and UL33. In cells infected with mutants (e.g. ts or null mutants) in any of the eight genes, capsids and HSV-1 DNA accumulate, but no encapsidation is observed. Previous studies have suggested potential roles for some of the eight processing/ packaging proteins. For example, the UL15 and UL28 gene products have been proposed to bind to DNA pac sites and translocate DNA into the capsid in a fuction analogous to that of the large subunit of bacteriophage terminase. The UL6 protein, a minor component of the capsid, may function like the bacteriophage portal or connector protein to mediate attachment of capsids to the terminase homolog. pUL25 may serve as a stopper or cap to keep DNA inside the capsid once it has entered.The goal of this research is to use ultrastructural and biochemical methods to clarify how HSV-1 DNA is encapsidated and how the processing/packaging proteins participate in encapsidation events. Ultrastructural studies will involve electron microscopic examination of HSV-1-infected cells after specific immuno-gold staining for capsid and processing/packaging proteins. It is expected that high resolution (~10 nm) information about the location of a protein in the infected cell nucleus will provide clues about its function. For instance, if pUL15 is involved in DNA translocation into the capsid, then it ought to be found near the site where DNA enters the capsid shell. Similarly, the cap protein should be localized to one particular site on the capsid shell after DNA packaging is complete, but possibly not before. Biochemical studies will be carried out to develop an in vitro system for HSV-1 DNA packaging. Such a system would facilitate more detailed analysis of the encapsidation process by providing the opportunity to manipulate the conditions of packaging outside an infected cell. Efforts to develop an in vitro packaging system will involve lysing infected cells, incubating the lysates and testing for evidence of DNA encapsidation during the incubation period. Evidence for packaging in crude cell lysates will be established before more purified systems are examined. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-technical \r\n\r\nIn herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), viral DNA is contained inside an icosahedral capsid which in turn is surrounded by a membrane envelope. Infection involves the fusion of viral and host cell cytoplasmic membranes and the introduction of DNA-containing capsid into the cytoplasm.  The viral DNA migrates into the nucleus by injection through a nuclear pore. Viral DNA replication and assemblage of the virus take place within the nucleus. A further step for the maturation of the virus is packaging of the newly replicated DNA into viral capsid, which is then enveloped at the inner nuclear membrane before exiting the host cell. This step may proceed by de-envelopment at the outer nuclear membrane followed by re-envelopment in the cytoplasm. A total of eight proteins coded by the virus genome have been identified to involve in these various processes. The goal of this study is to clarify specially how HSV-1 DNA is encapsidated and how some, if not all, of these proteins participate in encapsidation events. High resolution (~10 nm) electron microscopy with specific immuno-gold staining will be used to track these proteins in cells upon infection. This information is expected to provide clues about their function.   Biochemical studies will also be carried out to develop an HSV-1 DNA packaging system using reconstituted cell extracts. Such a system would facilitate more detailed analysis of the encapsidation process by providing the opportunity to manipulate the conditions of packaging outside an infected cell.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
