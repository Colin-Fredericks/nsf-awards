However, it is necessary to retain a fine degree of \r\ncontrol over the synchronization conditions in the computation. This research\r\ninvestigates a framework to provide the necessary control on synchronization \r\nand communication among the distributed agents by addressing the following. \r\nFirst, various forms of synchronization between distributed agents whose \r\nactions can be viewed at different levels of abstraction are defined. \r\nSecond, mechanisms to specify and enforce the desired forms of synchronization,\r\nto detect the forms of synchronization that occur, and to monitor the \r\ncomputation nonintrusively are designed. Third, algorithms for efficient \r\ncommunication among the synchronizing agents are designed and evaluated. \r\nThe research is expected to impact the ease with which the increasingly \r\ncomplex distributed applications can be synchronized, controlled, and \r\nmonitored while maintaining a fine degree of control over the synchronization \r\ninvolved. This has the potential to simplify the design of the rapidly\r\nincreasing number of large distributed applications. \r\n\r\n",
