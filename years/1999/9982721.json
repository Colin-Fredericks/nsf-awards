 "awd_abstract_narration": "Capone  9982721\r\n\r\nCurrent evidence suggests that N2 fixation by marine planktonic cyanobacteria may be a key factor controlling variations in oceanic productivity and, therefore, of C02 sequestration over paleoecological time scales. However, methods are currently lacking to evaluate directly whether or how N2 fixation has covaried with oceanic productivity over such time scales.  Much of our knowledge of paleoecological trends to date derives from the geochemical analysis of material sedimented to the sea floor from planktonic populations in overlying waters.  DNA in cells falling out of the water column can be preserved in sedimentary deposits over geologically significant (I K-> I OOK years) time scales and may therefore provide a more direct record of the identity of water column populations and their metabolic potentials. The genes of the nitrogenase (N2 fixing) enzyme system have been well characterized for a wide variety of prokaryotes. The investigator has developed methods to efficiently extract and amplify DNA from surficial marine sediments. Cyanobacterial DNA can be recovered from current aquatic sediments and nifH sequences isolated, identified, and distinguished from the nifH sequences of other physiological types of N2 fixers.\r\n\r\nThe PI will explore the ability to use this  approach to analyze and reconstruct paleoecological trends in N2 fixing cyanobacteria by extracting DNA from deeper sediment horizons underlying areas known to harbor N2 fixing cyanobacteria in the water column. Living cyanobacteria would not be expected in these horizons and should represent material earlier laid down in the sediments. As a test of this proposition, the author will examine sediments from 3 sites where planktonic N2 fixing cyanobacteria are known to have proliferated and have been recorded in the sediments through their pigment signatures. These include a lake system in the Experimental Lake Region of Canada, the Goteland basin of the Baltic Sea, and in Mediterranean sapropel deposits. Key preliminary challenges will be 1) to determine the extent of preservation of cyanobacterial DNA with increasing sediment depth and, therefore, time and 2) to be able to provide some level of relative quantitation of gene occurrence among horizons.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the PI would be to apply this method to shelf sediments of marine systems where strong trends in water column N2 fixation over glacial/ interglacial time scales have been inferred such as the Arabian Sea - thereby providing important direct insights on microbial populations dynamics which may directly affect climatological trends. Furthermore, these efforts would provide a model system for the analysis of other functional enzymes of biogeochemically relevance on paleoecological time scales.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to develop and employ a molecular approach for describing biogeochemical aspects of ancient microbial communities. The specific aim is to examine the development of cyanobacterial populations that would reflect the presence and absence of N2 fixing conditions over geological time scales. This approach would provide unique data on the functional role of microorganisms in a historical context, and thus will provide new information on the history of N2 fixation on Earth.\r\n\r\n",
