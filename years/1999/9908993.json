Through Research (ACER) Program is to attract undergraduate students to chemistry, chemical engineering, and biosciences; nurture and enhance educational achievements of undergraduate students; provide a firm foundation of research experience; and encourage outstanding undergraduates to pursue related graduate degrees. ACER's three main elements are: (1) Student Recruiting/Research Assistant Program, (2) Enhancing Infrastructure and Updating Teaching Methods, and (3) a Visiting Scientist Teaching Program. The program's objective is to ensure that 75% of ACER graduates win admission to good Ph.D. program in biological and chemical sciences.\r\n\r\nACER will recruit and support at least 60 students over the five years, beginning recruitment in the freshman year. Students will be individually mentored, provided research experience (including support for summer research), and opportunities to publish and attend national conferences. Top international research scientists will provide one-month courses in mathematics for life scientists, thermodynamics, biophysics, bioelectrochemistry, chemical engineering, nanochemistry and nanotechnology, biosensors, environmental chemistry, and surface chemistry. This will also introduce outside institutions and scientists to OC's capabilities and faculty, building a network of future collaboration and partnering opportunities.\r\n\r\nHigh quality of education requires a strong scientific research program. Through ACER, students will have access to research capabilities, equipment and techniques that are being used in the best universities.\r\n",
