 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop, in conjunction with the Santa Fe Institute, to explore the interface between climate and society by focusing on the Colorado Plateau for the period of approximately one thousand years before the arrival of Europeans (broadly AD 500-1600).  This region and period is of interest because its climate is relatively well known, at seasonal to annual resolution, and much of what is known about the human societies has a similarly firm chronological base.  This will help us understand the links between known patterns of cultural changes and the physical environment in which they occurred.  Thus the primary goal of the workshop will be to stimulate productive interchange between those with knowledge and understanding of climate variability on the one hand, and those able to speak to questions of cultural change, on the other.  The workshop is scheduled to be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico (10-13 May, 1999).",
