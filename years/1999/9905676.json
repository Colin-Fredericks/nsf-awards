 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies suggest that estrogen can influence cognitive processes.\r\nIt is hypothesized that these effects are due, in part, to the ability of\r\nestrogen to enhance the functional status of cholinergic projections to\r\nthe hippocampus and cortex by affecting cholinergic and GABAergic\r\nneurons within specific regions of the basal forebrain.\r\n\r\nThe proposed studieson rats will use a combination of biochemical,\r\npharmacological, and behavioral techniques to examine the effects of\r\nestrogen replacement on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and\r\ncorresponding cognitive processes.  One major goal is to test the\r\nhypothesis that estrogen replacement can reduce cognitive impairments\r\nassociated with the loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.  This\r\ngoal will be accomplished by examining the ability of estrogen\r\nreplacement to reduce impairments in learning, memory and attentional\r\nprocesses produced by selective cholinergic lesions in rats.  Another\r\nmajor goal is to examine the ability of estrogen to reduce\r\nGABA-receptor-mediated effects on cholinergic activity.  This will be\r\naccomplished using an in vivo microdialysis approach and examining the\r\nability of estrogen to prevent decreases in acetylcholine release\r\nproduced by lorazepam.\r\nThese studies will help provide an integrated, mechanistic account of\r\nhow estrogen replacement influences interactions between cholinergic and\r\nGABAergic systems in the basal forebrain and hippocampus, and will help\r\nto define potential mechanisms by which estrogen replacement can reduce\r\ncognitive impairments associated with alterations in cholinergic and\r\nGABAergic activity.\r\n",
