 "awd_abstract_narration": "Herpetological collections rarely curate prenatal life history stages of reptiles.  Since 1984 a significant collection of embryonic and neonatal reptiles has been built at Old Dominion University (ODU).  To date holdings include 6,717 embryos and neonates belonging to six families, 31 genera, and 59 species of squamate reptiles.  Over 700 additional specimens are associated with the embryo collection; most are females (dams) from which eggs or embryos in the collection were obtained.\r\n\r\nThe collection and curation of vertebrate embryos requires a considerable investment of time and resources.  The reptilian embryo collection at ODU is likely the largest collection of its kind in existence, and the effort that has gone into its establishment is unlikely to be duplicated.  Furthermore, the collection merits wider recognition among, and use by, other researchers.  Indeed, several individuals have either borrowed material or visited the collection at ODU.  However, before the material can be made more widely available to the research community the collection data must be transferred from a paper catalog to an electronic  format.  A computerized catalog would allow more efficient management of the process of preparing loans.  The  collection also requires upgrading of the condition of the utility cabinets (for embryos) and buckets (for dams)in which most of the specimens currently are housed.  This project would bring all specimens up to the highest curatorial standards, including housing all specimens in appropriate cabinets or tanks.\r\n",
