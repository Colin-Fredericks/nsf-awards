 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award supplements a half salary sabbatical for J. R. Quine to spend a year at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida.  He will immerse himself in the scientific\r\nenvironment of the laboratory to get a better knowledge of the experimental side of the research and will supply mathematical expertise in a collaboration with Timothy Cross, Director of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), on the determination of protein structure using solid-state NMR.  The year at NHMFL will provide Quine the opportunity to study first hand the theory and experimental techniques of scientific disciplines which are not his expertise ... NMR, crystallography, quantum mechanics, protein structure.  This will enhance communication between  mathematics and the other sciences in the Institute for Molecular Biophysics (IMB) at FSU and the NHMFL.  Quine will supervise a mathematics graduate student funded on a NSF Research Training Grant through IMB who is writing a dissertation on this application of mathematics and working at NHMFL,  and will assist other mathematics and IMB students working at NHMFL.  He will develop course materials to explain the mathematical questions of concern to the bench scientists at NHMFL to mathematics and other IMB students.  The NHMFL provides a multidisciplinary environment for researchers,\r\nwhere many areas of expertise are required to reach the scientific goal of structure determination using magnetic resonance.   This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
