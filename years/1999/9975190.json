 "awd_abstract_narration": "9975190\r\nCorcoran\r\n\r\nA novel method for the production of nanoporous metals is using alloy corrosion for selective dissolution.  This process involves electrochemically parting one element from a binary alloy to produce a highly nanoporous metal of the remaining element.  Although this process is well known within the corrosion community, the potential benefit of using the selective dissolution process to produce high surface-area electrodes has not been explored.  This grant provides a detailed characterization of the nanoporosity created in metal alloys during selective dissolution under well-controlled environmental conditions.   The conditions are designed to change the relative rates of the roughening and smoothing processes.  Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) characterizes the full three-dimensional morphology of the porosity.  The SANS experiments are carried out at the Cold Neutron Research Facility of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.   Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterizes the surface morphological changes that occur during dealloying.  The STM can also quantify the surface diffusivity of the more noble element in the various dealloying environments.  The research plan includes:  (1) quantifying the in-situ time evolution of the full three-dimensional pore size distribution that is formed during selective dissolution as a function of electrochemical environment, applied voltage and alloy composition; (2) quantifying the coarsening kinetics of porous metals as a function of temperature, electrochemical environment, and melting point of the alloying elements; and (3) using STM to measure the evolution of island sizes developed during selective removal of surface atoms as a function of the electrochemical environment.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research gives the first detailed morphological characterization of the effect of electrochemical environment on formation of porosity during dealloying.  The research data provide a foundation for using selective dissolution to create high surface-area electrodes for amperometric sensors (with a specific interest in biomedical sensing).  Nanoporous metals have tremendous potential in such diverse areas as high surface-area electrodes for electrochemical energy storage and conversion, biomedical sensor applications for disease diagnosis and treatment, and unique filtration applications in highly corrosive environments.  \r\n***\r\n",
