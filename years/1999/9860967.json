 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860967\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will identify and fabricate ferroelectric materials optimized for use as cathodes in high-current-density high-repetition-rate electron guns.  An iterative process of materials synthesis, electron emission measurement, and characterization and evaluation, after emission, will be used.  The focus will be on lead zirconate-titanate and related perovskites, and the work will explore tradeoffs between electrical and optical properties to obtain desired electron emission properties while minimizing degradation. This project was motivated by recent research demonstrating that ferroelectric cathodes using commercial ferroelectric materials that were optimized for transducer applications can produce current densities in excess of 30 Amperes per square centimeter at 500,000 Volts, and can sustain an emission pulse (at 50,000 Volts) for a time in excess of 2 microseconds.  In Phase II, this proposer will fabricate specimens of the optimized materials in appropriate sizes and shapes for testing as cathodes of an electron gun.\r\n     Ferroelectric cathodes will be high-brightness electron sources for high-power microwave tubes, for electron accelerators for radiation oncology and research, and for beam applications including low-pressure switches and flat-panel displays.\r\n",
