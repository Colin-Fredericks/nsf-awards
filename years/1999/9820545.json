 "awd_abstract_narration": "9820545\r\nColorado State University\r\nVincent G. Murphy\r\n\r\nBiotechnology is a field that has grown rapidly in the past decade.  As biotechnology products \r\nare identified and their efficacy verified, there will be an increasing need for chemical engineers with \r\nexpertise in bioprocessing.  Colorado has established the Colorado Bioprocessing Center (CBC) at \r\nColorado State University as a resource for both academic and industrial research and development.  \r\nThe CBC has a full spectrum of bioprocess equipment at both bench and pilot scales for fermentation, \r\ncell culture and product recovery research.  A skilled group of faculty in the Department of Chemical \r\nand Bioresource Engineering CBE) works closely with the CBC staff on both basic and applied\r\nresearch projects.  This proposal requests funds for renewing a REU site focused around the unique \r\nresearch environment of the CBC.  Students selected for participation in the program would first \r\nparticipate in a series of lectures conducted by CBE  faculty on the fundamentals of biochemical \r\nengineering.  This would be followed by hands-on experience with the process and analytical \r\nequipment in the CBC and the development and execution of a focused research project with the \r\nguidance and support of a CBE faculty advisor and the CBC staff Students would share their \r\nexperiences with fellow participants at weekly colloquia and a concluding symposium.  The goal is to \r\nexpose the students to a variety of bioprocessing research opportunities at both the undergraduate and \r\ngraduate levels in preparation for a career in bioprocessing research and development.  The initial three \r\nyears of the program were successful in providing research opportunities to minority students (two), \r\nwomen (ten), and to eight students from smaller schools with limited research programs.  Fourteen of \r\nthe 22 students representing 16 universities) who participated in the program are either in or committed \r\nto attending graduate school or now work in research laboratories.\r\n",
