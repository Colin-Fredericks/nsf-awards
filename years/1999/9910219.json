 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)project is to develop a universal framework for representing the frictional boundary conditions at the tool-chip interface in machining based on fractal theory.  Previous studies conducted using photomicrographs from literature provide justification for this approach.  Mathematical models developed in preliminary work will be validated and improved with real experimental data.  The fractal behavior of the tool-chip interface will be investigated, and the materials and cutting conditions leading to different fractal dimensions will be quantified.  These dimensions will be used to determine the shape, size, location and proportion of sliding/sticking islands at the interface, which will then be used to calculate contact area, cutting forces, total power expended, and cutting temperatures.  Comparison with traditional models will be conducted.  \r\n\r\nThis project has the potential of drawing new insight into the machining process and generating more accurate models of the process for the prediction of cutting forces, cutting temperatures, and tool wear.  If successful, it should benefit cutting tool design, coating material development, and machining parameter selection.\r\n",
