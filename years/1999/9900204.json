 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of a matrix architecture that organizes the information, activities and decisions used by automated computer planners in generating process plans. In particular, the work will focus on integration of fixture and setup planning tasks for machined prismatic parts.  It is a major challenge to organize process planning activities in an effective manner because many planning sub-tasks, such as setup and fixture planning, are tightly interrelated.  Strict sequential ordering of such subtasks often leads to suboptimal planning decisions.  In this work, the goal is to provide an architecture that allows solutions to interrelated planning subtasks to be incrementally developed, interleaved, and information shared between them.  This will allow decisions in each subtask to influence each other, resulting in choices that make more sense in the context of the plan as a whole.  The work will entail development of efficient representations for multiple possible part shapes, setups and fixturing options, and use of least commitment techniques for increased incremental plan development.  The effectiveness of these principles will be implemented and assessed in a manufacturing planner for 3 and 5 axis milling.  The work will focus on prismatic parts for a wide variety of applications such as the aerospace, and automotive industries.\r\n     If successful, this work will advance approaches to modeling and organization of process planning, providing a richer and more accurate representation.  Expected benefits include more effective process planning tools that make more informed global setup and fixturing decisions and trade-offs while reducing the need for re-planning cycles.  It is hoped that the availability of such tools will help process planners to create manufacturing plans more quickly, accurately, and with greater consistency, thus increasing the feasibility of small batch planning needed for just-in-time practices.\r\n",
