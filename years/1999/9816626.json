 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hanawalt         This award will help enable  less-established scientists to participate in the seventh bi-annual Gordon Research Conference on Mammalian DNA Repair in Ventura, California, Feb. 7 - Feb. 12, 1999.  The selected speakers are current leaders in this area and related cellular processes. Besides providing a forum for these experts to present their most recent results and ideas, the conference will facilitate wide-ranging interactions among all attendees through Plenary Discussion Sessions and at posters. To stimulate debate following the plenary talks, selected poster presenters (generally students and younger scientists) will be given the opportunity to highlight their research results in short presentations, The attendees will be chosen globally from universities, research institutes, and government and industrial research labs.  The sessions will define areas in which exciting new information is emerging but in which experts may disagree. The session topics include the following:  repair of endogenous damage in nuclei and mitochondria; translesion synthesis and repair of mismatches; DNA repair enzyme structure and substrate interactions; nucleotide excision repair - the role of transcription; base excision repair - overlap with other pathways; inducible responses and cell cycle checkpoints; and cellular localization of repair and effects of bound proteins.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this conference will examine DNA repair as a key component in the genomic surveillance that is so crucial to the overall integrity and function of mammalian cells. Recent discoveries have catapulted DNA repair into a pivotal position in fundamental research in the fields of  aging, environmental health, and developmental biology. It is hoped that the most promising and exciting avenues of research will be highlighted in robust discussions at this conference.\r\n",
