 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860118\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will examine a novel retrofitable, high efficiency, variable capacity cooling system that uses the expansion/condensation cycle in a new way.  Industry uses significant amounts of energy for air conditioning, water chilling, process cooling, and refrigeration.  By using a novel refrigerant combined with an adjustable expansion device,  system capacity may be incrementally increased  by 30 to 50 percent on demand, while simultaneously achieving a 5-10 percent increase in energy efficiency.  Phase I  objectives are to identify suitable candidate refrigerants, assemble a bench-top test unit, and perform tests and cost analysis to establish feasibility.  Candidate refrigerants will be identified using a systematic evaluation process.  Bench-top tests will measure cooling capacity and energy efficiency with and without the novel improvement so that a direct comparison can be made.  Performance and costs will be estimated for a range of cooling applications.\r\n     The new technology could be designed in or retrofitted to cooling systems and would have wide application in all types of refrigeration, air conditioning, water chilling, and process cooling systems.  Based on the size of current industrial, transportation, and domestic cooling markets, the potential market is $100 million to $1 billion annually for a new variable capacity cooling system.\r\n",
