Since its inception in 1992, it has grown to be part of elementary school's curriculum impacting about 300 students annually.  While maintaining an active research laboratory where she studies the optical characteristics of semiconductors, Dr. Chandrasekhar also developed three additional programs: (i) Families Exploring Science and Technology, where 6th and 7th grade students and their parents build a drawbridge; (ii) Saturday Science, where 8th and 9th grade students visit local industrial sites and participate in hands-on activities; and, (iii) Newton Academy, a ten-day residential science and technology program for female students in grades 9 through 11.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
