 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to implement field experiences into three undergraduate courses on the SUNY, Binghamton University campus, we have adapted and installed industry standard hydrological and environmental data gathering equipment within the Fuller Hollow Creek Watershed as a laboratory component since students will encounter this equipment and these methods in their professional work after graduation.  This adaptation concept of use of a small well field was implemented at several universities in recent years (e.g. Fletcher, 1994; Rahn and Davis, 1996; Hluchy, 1997; Hluchy, 1998).  The work done by Hluchy at Alfred University was funded in part through the NSF and served as the model for our field hydrogeology program.  We are expanding on the well field concept by incorporating water quality sampling and adding the capability for monitoring meteorological and atmospheric data using sampling protocol and equipment in use at the University of Michigan's Air Quality Laboratory.\r\nThese instrumented sites and the data collected are used in several disciplines enhancing students' lecture related learning.  This experience allows students to develop and conduct scientific research projects at the undergraduate level.  Within the confines of the campus, the watershed contains areas with varying degrees of anthropogenic development.  Installing instruments at several locations maximizes the potential for measuring differences in environmental parameters within the same watershed.  A well field, stream and surface water runoff weirs, precipitation gage, and evaporation pan are placed within the perturbed portion of the watershed.  Shallow observation wells and a rain gage are placed in the University's Nature Preserve within the relatively unperturbed portion of the watershed.  A meteorological and atmospheric monitoring station is located on the roof of the Science I building allowing students to monitor and explore differences in physical and chemical processes between and within the atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere on real time scales in portions of a watershed with variable anthropogenic impacts.",
