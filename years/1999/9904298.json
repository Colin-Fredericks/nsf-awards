The PI, John Grotzinger, has a broad program in geologic field mapping, with emphasis on sedimentary and structural geology.  Use of the digital data acquisition system will significantly increase the capability of this group in three directions.  In the first case, the data is obtained directly in the field in digital format for easy input into graphics workstations for data display and analysis.  In the second case, data acquisition may be greatly accelerated through the implementation of outcrop-scale remote sensing capabilities.  In the third case, digital data collection will allow definition and quantification of uncertainties in field measurements.\r\n\r\nEquipment to be acquired includes a differential GPS system (Leica 9500), with two rovers and reflectorless laser range finders (Vector GIS), a conventional total station with reflectorless range finders for detailed mapping of small-scale geologic features (Leica TM1800), and two portable pen-based computers and software for data storage and real-time viewing.  Position measurements from the Vector GIS laser range finder can be directly applied as offsets to measurements taken by the GPS receiver in real time.  This will allow rapid mapping, with a minimum number of equipment and data set merging problems.   This equipment will find immediate use for mapping along the steep slopes and cliff faces that flank the network of canyons in highly dissected terrains.  By mapping the steep slopes in multiple canyons, serial sections can be obtained through volumes of sedimentary rock.  These can be rendered in three dimensions and then interpolated between data points to provide state-of-the-art depictions of stratigraphic relationships in three dimensions.  Once in the workstation environment, the length scales of architectural elements, and the volumes of rock defined by facies boundaries or other stratal boundaries can be immediately quantified.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
