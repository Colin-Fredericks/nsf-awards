The goal of the\r\nproject is to provide a better theoretical understanding of how\r\nthe spatial distribution and movement of individuals affect the\r\npersistence or extinction of populations.  The motivation is to\r\ngain insight into the ways that spatial effects contribute to the\r\nmaintenance of biodiversity and the ways that changes in the\r\nspatial aspects of the environment can threaten biodiversity.\r\nThe project is primarily concerned with the construction and\r\nanalysis of models for edge-mediated effects and the development\r\nof methods for translating assumptions about the behavior of\r\nindividuals on a small spatial scale into conclusions about the\r\ndynamics of populations on a large spatial scale.  Edge-mediated\r\neffects occur when the presence of an interface between habitat\r\ntypes has an effect on population dynamics.  An example of an\r\nedge-mediated effect might occur if a fragment of habitat were\r\ncut off from a larger region by a road that some species would\r\ncross but others would not.  If the presence of the edge (the\r\nroad) thus resulted in a change in the species composition of the\r\necological community in the fragment, that would be an\r\nedge-mediated effect.  Issues of scaling from local behavior to\r\nlarge-scale conclusions arise in ecology because it is often\r\npossible to determine small-scale behavior by observing a few\r\nindividuals, while directly observing the overall dynamics of a\r\nlarge population is much more difficult.  The methodology of the\r\nproject is to construct mathematical models for spatially\r\ndistributed populations and then to analyze those models'\r\npredictions of persistence or extinction for the species they\r\ndescribe.  The mathematical models are typically based on\r\nordinary or partial differential equations.  The analysis\r\ntypically involves ideas from dynamical systems, nonlinear\r\nfunctional analysis (especially bifurcation theory), and partial\r\ndifferential equations (especially comparison methods and\r\nelliptic spectral theory).  A secondary goal is to obtain new\r\nmathematical results that are useful in the context of\r\napplications.\r\n     The investigators study ways of using mathematics to\r\nunderstand ecological problems.  The problems mostly involve\r\nspatial aspects of the environment; for example, how to design\r\nthe most effective nature reserves, or how to predict the likely\r\neffects of the fragmentation of natural habitats on the\r\npopulations that inhabit them.  The problems also involve\r\ninteractions between different biological species, for example\r\npredators and prey.  The methodology is to express the essential\r\nfeatures of a biological system in terms of equations and then to\r\nstudy the equations to determine what they predict.  The analysis\r\noften requires the development of new mathematical results, which\r\nmay be of use to other investigators.  A typical goal of the\r\nanalysis is to determine how various environmental and biological\r\nfactors affect the persistence or extinction of populations.  A\r\nreason for using mathematical models is that in situations\r\ninvolving endangered species, genetically engineered organisms,\r\nor large scale environmental change, it is often impossible to do\r\nexperiments but crucial to have some idea of what to expect.\r\nSome of the models are directly motivated by problems in refuge\r\ndesign or pest control.  Others are motivated by basic scientific\r\nquestions about the effects of the spatial aspects of\r\nenvironments on populations.  But even those may prove to be\r\nrelevant to issues raised in the contexts of environmental\r\nprotection and the biological effects of global change.  The\r\npotential benefits of the project include improved decision\r\nmaking in conservation, refuge design, land management, and urban\r\nplanning.\r\n",
