 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Response to an Acute Environmental Accident across \r\nan Ethnically Diverse Community\"\r\n\r\nThis investigation explores, in a timely manner, the risk perspectives, behaviors and responses of an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse community following an acute and significant environmental accident.  In March of this year, the Chevron oil refinery in Richmond, California experienced a significant explosion and fire in a processing unit for gasoline and airline fuel.  Several thousand nearby residents were warned to avoid contact with resulting fumes, and more than one-thousand residents visited emergency rooms with varying symptoms or complaints.  Recent research activities in the city of Richmond, examining risk perspectives and judgments prior to the Chevron incident, offers the research team an unusual opportunity to compare responses after the environmental accident to baseline or a priori beliefs, evaluations and values regarding environmental risk issues.  This longitudinal study uses multiple methods to assess how diverse social groups within this community respond over time to the recent environmental accident, and whether differences on preexisting beliefs and in the framing of risk problems predict variability in response to the explosion.  Additionally, the study examines the stability of prior beliefs given a significant risk event, and considers how these beliefs affect the processing, interpretation of and memory for scientific information about a serious environmental accident.   \r\n",
