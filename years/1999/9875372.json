 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nProfessor Michael Pishko will develop biosensor arrays based on highly ordered polymeric films containing biorecognition molecules. Rod-coil block copolymers will self-assemble on electrode surfaces. They will include segments that permit UV-initiated cross-linking and other segments that permit electron transfer from an immobilized enzyme such as glucose oxidase to the electrode surface. The investigator will study the effects of polymer structure on self-assembly, cluster formation, and electron transfer through the films using experimental and molecular modeling techniques. He will develop methods for immobilizing biorecognition molecules on those films and patterning them on surfaces using mid-UV photolithography to form sensor arrays. Future potential clinical and biomedical applications are envisioned. The educational plan includes the development of two new courses in materials for undergraduate and graduate students; summer research mentoring of undergraduate students; and a mentoring program for female high-school students. \r\n",
