 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Nowicki and Searcy propose to test whether early nutrition affects the \r\ndevelopment of song in birds.  Song development and production are controlled in\r\nsongbirds by a series of well defined brain areas, which develop to a large \r\nextent during the first two months after hatching.  In many species, the details\r\nof song are learned during this same two month interval.  Nowicki and Searcy \r\nhypothesize that nutrition during this period affects the development of the \r\nsong control regions in the brain and consequently affects song learning.  As a \r\ntest, they will manipulate level of nutrition in hand-reared sparrows during the\r\nfirst three weeks post-hatching.  The sparrows will be tutored with \r\ntape-recorded songs, and the songs produced by these birds as adults will be \r\nrecorded.  The stressed and unstressed groups will be compared for the quality \r\nof learning, in terms of how faithfully they have copied the notes of the tutor \r\nsongs, and for the quantity of learning, in terms of how many songs are learned \r\nper individual.  The brains of the two groups will also be compared, for the \r\nsize of the song control regions and the density of neurons in those regions.  \r\nFinally, the songs of stressed and unstressed birds will be compared in terms of\r\nhow well they function on ecologically relevant tasks.\r\n\r\nThe idea that stress early in life affects brain development and hence learning \r\nability is applicable to a wide variety of organisms, from birds to humans.  \r\nSong in songbirds provides an excellent model system for studying such effects, \r\nin that the neural control, development, and ecological function of the behavior\r\nare all relatively well known.  The study will use this system to enhance our \r\nunderstanding of the effects of nutrition on the development of complex \r\nbehaviors.\r\n\r\n",
