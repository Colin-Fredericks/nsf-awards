 "awd_abstract_narration": "FAMU\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the HBCU Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) is to significantly increase the number of African-American science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) students who will qualify for admission to graduate degree programs (particularly the doctoral degree) in SMET fields. The program also is designed to measurable increase the overall number of baccalaureate degrees awarded to SMET students by the University. The program will primarily focus on students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer and information sciences, electrical engineering, mathematics and physics. However, when fully implemented it will significantly impact all SMET undergraduate students at the University.\r\n\r\nProject goals will be achieved through a systematic adoption by the SMET university community of advances in research-based SMET teaching and learning methods, enhancements to the faculty development and reward systems and the wide-spread infusion of world-wide web (WWW) based technologies into the SMET curricula.\r\n\r\nSeveral individual project objectives have been defined to enable the overall goals to be met. These objectives are presented as follows:\r\n\r\n1) introduction of new teaching and learning techniques that encompass an inquiry-based pedagogy into the SMET curricula;\r\n\r\n2) introduction of a freshman level SMET honors section for entry-level courses in the departments of biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics;\r\n\r\n3) providing laboratory research experiences for sophomore level honor students;\r\n\r\n4) support faculty development of world-wide web (i.e. web) based courseware for entry-level \"gatekeeper\" courses within the departments of biology, chemistry, computer and information sciences, mathematics and electrical engineering;\r\n\r\n5) implementation of an Academic Learning Center that includes workshops, tutorials, peer mentoring, and career counseling for all SMET students;\r\n\r\n6) increasing the number of student teaching assistants assigned to support faculty teaching critical entry level SMET courses;\r\n\r\n7) upgrading of computing resources available to SMET faculty so that an faculty within the primary focus departments have adequate Internet connectivity.\r\n\r\nAdditional project objectives will include the:\r\n\r\n1) introduction of web based materials in other key SMET courses;\r\n\r\n2) implementation of a SMET Instruction/Teaching Technology Center to assist faculty with incorporating technology into their courses;\r\n\r\n3) development of a novel faculty reward system that recognizes student mentorship.\r\n\r\nThe project will widely employ both formative and summative evaluation to measure progress toward meeting overall project goals.\r\n",
