 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860391\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposed by Krispin Technologies Inc. will explore the novel concept of improving organic Rankine cycle engines (ORCEs) by exploiting unusual fluid dynamic behavior described by a relatively new area of science known as \"dense gas dynamics.\" ORCEs are currently being manufactured and used for numerous remote terrestrial applications requiring reliable, unattended power. One of the major loss mechanisms in ORCEs is due to shock waves generated in the turbine stage. Utilizing a \"dense gas\" working fluid to weaken or eliminate the shocks can potentially reduce such losses. Preliminary results by the Principal Investigator show very significant improvements in turbine efficiencies for dense gas working fluids over conventional ORCE working fluids. The proposed Phase I work consists of a computational parametric study to determine the optimal turbine stage design. Based on these findings, phase II work would then involve building and testing a prototype engine to determine actual performance improvements. \r\n     The potential improvements to ORCEs anticipated through this research and development will result in an efficient power generation technology that would represent a major breakthrough in the commercial turbomachinery industry and could have significant, positive economic and environmental impacts in energy production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
