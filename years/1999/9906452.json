 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first goal of this project is to collect a third wave of data in an ongoing panel study of the 804 adult members of 60 communal households. They were first interviewed in 1974-'75 and reinterviewed in 1986-'87. The second goal is to begin the process of moving this unique data set into the public domain. On the most basic level, this three wave data set will permit the study of reciprocal effects of belief systems and relational networks over time. It also will allow researchers to contextualize these effects in terms of changing conditions of group membership and the presence or absence of charismatic leadership. Substantively, there are four objectives. (1) To study the persistence of unconventional beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors; (2) to determine the extent of, and factors related to, the persistence over time of networks of dyadic relationships; (3) to investigate the ways in which attachment to shared beliefs affects the network of relational ties, and the ways in which the network of relational ties affects attachment to shared beliefs; and (4) to determine whether the association between beliefs and social relationships is different in the communes that had charismatic leaders than in the non-charismatic communes in our study. These results bear on such fundamental theoretical matters as the decay trajectories of relational networks and systems of belief over long periods of time, how these interact with one another and how they are influenced by organizational affiliations, leadership, and life events.",
