 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a number of problems in the general area of nonlinear \r\nwave propagation. Most of the problems considered are attempts to \r\nassess the effects of random inhomogeneities in the medium of propagation \r\non nonlinear structures such as solitons. In the case of linear media, \r\r\nit is well known that the effect of random inhomogeneities is to inhibit \r\r\nthe propagation of waves, an effect known as Anderson localization. The proposer \r\r\nwill study the competition between the effect of the inhomogeneities, which tend to \r\ndestroy a localized pulse such as a soliton, with the effect of nonlinearity,\r\nwhich acts to hold a pulse together. In earlier work he found \r\ninteresting and complicated behavior, with different ``phases'' in which \r\none effect or the other is dominant. He will also begin a project involving the \r\napplication of some of the tools of wave propagtion, most importantly the \r\nFeynman path integral, to problems of the transport of a passive scalar, \r\nsuch as a dye or tracer, by a fluid flow.   \r\n\r\nThe kind of problems addressed in this project are best \r\nillustrated by one important application, that of laser light propagating \r\nin an optical fiber. Very intense light in an optical fiber has the somewhat \r\nsurprising property that it can interact with itself, and can actually focus\r\nitself. This process of self-focusing leads to the formation of bright spots, \r\ncalled solitons, which propagate along the fiber without changing shape. These \r\nsolitons are of great interest due to the possibility of using them as the \r\nbasis for optical communications systems. This project studies how these \r\nkinds of structures are effected by variations in the fiber properties. \r\nThe fundamental question is this: Do these solitons persist when the \r\nproperties of the fiber are allowed to vary, or are they destroyed?\r\n\r\n",
