The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide support for a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Jordy Kaufman to work with Dr. Mark Henry Johnson at Birkbeck College, University of London in the UK.\r\nDr. Kaufman will do cognitive neuroscience studies of infant spatial and object representation.  A new technological and methodological advancement is a neuroimaging technique called high-density event-related potentials (HD-ERP) which can be used with infants to directly examine the neural pathways - dorsal and ventral cortical - to see how they are activated in a variety of cognitive tasks.  A large number of sensors are used in a geodesic net which is placed on the subject's head to provide excellent temporal resolution and spatial resolution which is better than that found with older methods.  For the first time, using this methodology, one can actually measure brain activation in infants during well-designed behavioral tasks.  The planned experiments will approach the problem of how brain development in human infants relates to the development of their cognitive abilities.\r\nThe host, Dr. Johnson, is one of the few scientists in the world who have the ability and materials to use high-density event-related potentials with human infants.  His lab also has access to William's Syndrome patients, which provides an extremely rare and valuable research opportunity.  He is well-known for his non-imaging studies.\r\n***\r\n",
