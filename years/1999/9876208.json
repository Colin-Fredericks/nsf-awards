The research is concentrated on strong correlation and disorder effects in condensed matter systems.  The goal is to advance the understanding of strongly correlated and disordered systems by developing new theoretical and computational methods which can be applied to explain experimental data and suggest new directions for condensed matter physics.  More specifically, the research is focused on the transport and noise properties of low dimensional electronic systems (such as quantum wires, fractional quantum Hall liquids, quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes), on critical phenomena that result from both quenched disorder and interaction in electronic systems (such as the recently observed metal-insulator transitions in Si-MOSFET's), and on complex scaling phenomena in electronic systems (such as multifractal scaling).  The research is reflected in the educational component of the project in areas which range from development of new courses and textbooks in solid state physics and disordered systems, to individual training and supervision of graduate students in condensed matter physics, to the attraction of traditionally underrepresented students into science.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is a CAREER grant to a starting faculty member for a program which integrates research and education.
