 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this proposal we intend to address student learning and attitude in our general chemistry course by incorporating computational tools for problem solving into weekly activity sessions. These activity sessions will include a flexible combination of wet-laboratory experimentation with computerized data collection as appropriate, data analysis, molecular modeling, and group problem solving. To facilitate this enhancement, we plan to equip our general chemistry laboratory with the modem computer tools of a chemist. The equipment will be used in the weekly small-group activity sessions, which are an integral part of our general chemistry course. The application of computational tools to chemical problems will be systematically introduced to students in sequential activities, which teach and ultimately integrate different methodologies for measuring, modeling, and understanding chemical phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe specific equipment requested include a computer problem solving station for each pair of students that will consist of a low-cost computer, data acquisition hardware. Each computer will be loaded with software licensed by the college, including molecular modeling software. Additionally, computer projection equipment for the laboratory is requested.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of the curricular changes motivating this proposal is augmenting the participatory activities we offer students in order to improve their learning in general chemistry. Experiments will be improved by better and more efficient data collection followed by subsequent analysis. Learning and understanding will be enhanced by individual access to modeling software. By creating a classroom atmosphere that encourages engaged and cooperative inquiry, our proposed general chemistry activity sessions will not only improve students' learning but their perception of science as well.\r\n",
