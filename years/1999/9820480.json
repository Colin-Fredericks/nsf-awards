 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Minnesota.  The ten-week program will emphasize student participation in the research activities of faculty affiliated with the Center for Cognitive Sciences.  Eleven undergraduates will participate with support from NSF.  The focus on recruitment will be under-represented groups and undergraduates from small colleges in the upper Midwest with limited research opportunities.  Students will: (1) work as a full member of their faculty mentor'' research team; (2) complete a research project including a written report and oral presentation to peers and participating faculty; (3) participate in a multidisciplinary research training seminar for credit; and (4) participate in a special non-credit 'Master Student' course.  Seminar activities include presentations by program faculty and faculty in related areas campus-wide, laboratory tours, and lectures on research tools, design, and ethics.  The fully integrated program includes opportunities for the students to learn specific research methods, to apply these methods in the context of their own research, and to examine broad conceptual and methodological issues relating to the cognitive sciences.  Participation in special social and cultural 'team-building' events as well as common housing in a University dorm is designed to foster a strong community of students.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n\r\n",
