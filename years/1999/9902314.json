 "awd_abstract_narration": "The establishment and maintenance of proper mitochondrial morphology involves regulated mitochondrial fusion events.  Although mitochondrial fusion is observed in a wide range of organisms and cell types, very little is known about the molecules or mechanisms that coordinate the fusion of the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes.  An important observation is that a transmembrane GTPase called Fzo1p regulates mitochondrial fusion in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  A complete understanding of the biochemical activity of Fzo1p as well as other proteins necessary for fusion will require in vitro assays for each of the distinct steps of fusion.  The purpose of this project is to develop in vitro assays that measure mitochondrial docking and membrane fusion in a reconstituted system using components isolated from yeast cells.  These assays will exploit novel fusion proteins which contain green fluorescent protein (GFP) and blue fluorescent protein (BFP) and which can be targeted to different mitochondrial compartments.  These proteins will be used to develop (1) a light microscopic assay for mitochondrial docking and aggregation, and (2) a complementation assay for actual fusion.  The complementation assay will employ a construct of BFP and GFP linked together, which exhibits fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and a specific protease, which when fusion occurs cleaves the BFP-GFP linkage and causes loss of FRET.  The assays will be used to study the role of wild-type and mutant forms of Fzo1p.  Once developed, these assays can also be employed to identify and study other proteins involved in each step of the fusion process.  Ultimately, the assays may lead to an understanding of how the mitochondria coordinate the separate fusion of their outer and inner membranes.\r\n\r\n",
