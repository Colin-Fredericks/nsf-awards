 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses new methods for crystallization of the group III nitrides from the melt. Activities include: growth of bulk polycrystalline and single crystal gallium nitride and indium nitride; synthesis of thick and thin film GaN and InN on substrates; and optical, electronic, and structural characterization of the crystals. The aim is to provide an attractive alternative to the current high pressure process for synthesis of bulk group III nitrides; increased understanding of the phase relationships in the group III/nitrogen systems; and further insights into the role of alloying, impurities, defects, and grain boundaries on light emission from the group III nitrides. The approach is to use atomic nitrogen to produce saturated melts of gallium (or indium) from which GaN (or InN) can be crystallized. The decomposition of GaN and InN to the elements is suppressed at low pressures if the crystals are in contact with the nitrogen saturated melt. A main focus of the research will be to achieve stable growth of single crystals and single crystal films through control of temperature and concentration gradients. Horizontal gradient freezing and growth through thin liquid films (a form of liquid phase epitaxy) will be the principal methods employed. Third elements, e.g., In and Sn, will be used to suppress the liquidus temperature and enhance nitrogen solubility. Doping studies will be attempted by including small, controlled amounts of dopants, e.g., Mg and Si, in the original liquid metal. The synthetic work will be complemented by concurrent electrical, optical and structural characterization.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important fabrication aspects of electronic/photonic devices.  New experimental materials science and optical tools are now available to allow new approaches which when better understood provide advances in fundamental science and technology. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the perform-ance of advanced devices and circuits for computing and communications.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.\r\n***\r\n",
