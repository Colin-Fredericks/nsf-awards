 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nJackiewicz\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this project to study various acceleration \r\ntechniques for continuous and discrete waveform relaxation\r\niterations. These techniques include exponential, polynomial or\r\nToeplitz preconditioning and/or overlapping components of the \r\nsystem. We will also study the construction and implementation \r\nof novel numerical methods for ordinary differential equations\r\nwhich are special cases of general linear methods. Such methods \r\nare appropriate for nonstiff or stiff differential systems in a\r\nsequential or parallel computing environment. These methods have\r\nalso higher potential to preserve qualitative properties of the \r\nsolution than classical methods. This potential will be exploited\r\nto integrate wave propagation problems with absorbing boundary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe research supported by this proposal will lead to the development\r\nof modern software for the solution of many problems in science and\r\nengineering which are governed by large differential systems. This\r\nsoftware will be based on novel numerical methods developed in the\r\npast few years by the principal investigator and his coworkers and \r\nwill utilize modern computer architecture by splitting the underlying\r\nlarge problem into smaller subsystems or subproblems which can then be \r\nsolved in parallel by allocating them to different processors. \r\nNumerical experiments on many problems, for example, acoustic wave\r\npropagation, chemical reactions, movements of a plate under the load\r\nof a car passing through it, catastrophe model for the nerve impulse\r\nmechanism, model that describes the dynamics of a system with large\r\nnumber of particles which can form clusters, and reaction-diffusion\r\nsystems, indicate that these novel methods are more efficient and \r\nrobust and better suited to take advantage of the state-of-the-art\r\ncomputer architecture than the methods which are currently in use for\r\nthese problems.\r\n",
