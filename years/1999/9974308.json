 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nBREZINSKY, KENNETH\r\nCTS-9974308\r\n\r\nThis is a study of hydrocarbon chemistry related to soot formation.  The approach is centered on single-pulse shock-tube studies in a high-pressure shock-tube facility designed to permit extraction of quenched reaction intermediates and products as functions of well-defined pressures, temperatures, and residence times.  Extracted samples are analyzed with gas chromatography/mass specteometry (GC/MS).  Additional studies are conducted in a low-pressure shock tube where the principal means of reaction diagnosis is the laser schlieren method of rate evaluation.  Three systems are studied:  (1) benzyne chemistry including in-situ pyrolysis of phthalic anhydride to produce benzyne and its subsequent pyrolysis to examine its role both as a decomposition pathway in aromatics chemistry and as a possible route to larger molecule formation through biphenylene; (2) diacetylene pyrolysis including shock-tube studies of dilute diacetylene/argon and dilute diacetylene/acetylene/argon mixtures to examine the mechanism of soot formation in the presence of diacetylene; and (3) reactions of 1,5-hexadiyne including shock-tube studies of 1,5-heaxdiyne to discriminate among alternate pathways to benzene.\r\n",
