 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875115\r\nHufnagel\r\n\r\nThere are variety of theories regarding the initiation of shear bands.  These models postulate changes in atomic-scale structure associated with the initiation of a shear band, so it should be possible to verify them by appropriate characterization of the structure.  This project involves a series of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and extended energy loss fine structure (EXELFS) experiments designed to: (a) identify the atomic-scale structural changes associated with shear band formation with the goal to elucidate the mechanisms of shear band formation; and (b) characterize the interactions of shear bands with second-phase particles, examining the effect of particles on both shear band nucleation and motion.  Structural observations are correlated with the results of quasi-static mechanical testing.  The career development plan integrates these research goals with the education of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as professional development of local high school science teachers.  This is achieved by developing an intensive, informative and entertaining two-week summer program for economically and socially at-risk high school students.  The summer program focuses on the use of innovative materials in sports equipment, and emphasizes extensive student-teacher interaction, interaction with the members of the research group, hands-on experience, and teamwork.  By comparing the relevant properties of currently-used materials with new materials (bulk metallic glasses), the students and teachers will gain an appreciation for the materials selection process and see how fundamental scientific advances in materials can be converted into practical technology.  It will provide the teachers with relevant examples of materials in modern technology, useful ideas for demonstrations and experiments, and contacts in the university for further professional development.\r\n%%%\r\nThe recent development of bulk glass-forming alloys has opened up a new range of engineering applications for metallic glasses.  Metallic glasses may now be employed in applications where their unique mechanical properties are advantageous.  These developments have highlighted a need for an improved understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of permanent deformation of metallic glasses\r\n***\r\n",
