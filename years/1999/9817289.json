The goal of this pilot project will be to produce a set of valid and reliable research instruments and methods to revise and resubmit a proposal for a larger project to test the hypothesis that ecotourism involvement improves household livelihood security and reduces household vulnerability. The researchers, cultural anthropologists from Baylor University and the University of Kansas, will collect anthropometric and socio-economic data from households in four community sites, two each in Belize and Costa Rica, one of which engaged in ecotourism and the other matched as much as possible except for a lack of ecotourism involvement, over a period of one summer.  The researchers will train students to accompany them in the research, and will also train two field assistants from a host country university.  They will gather preliminary data on households and communities, and will test the validity and reliability of an index of Household livelihood security and vulnerability.  \r\nThe research will help advance our understanding of the effects of this relatively new form of tourism on host communities, as well as further the research careers of two female scientists, and help train students in research design and methods.  \r\n",
