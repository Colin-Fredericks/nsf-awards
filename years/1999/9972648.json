 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972648\r\n\r\nThe investigator studies study topics in enumerative combinatorics related to continued fractions, differential operators,  polytopes associated with bin-packing algorithms, and identities for Bernoulli numbers and related sequences.  The work on  continued fractions extends Flajolet's combinatorial approach in two directions: first, to some well-known continued fractions, such as those associated with the moments of Jacobi polynomials, and second, to a little-studied generalization of continued fractions called \"Lukasiewicz continued fractions\" or \"multicontinued fractions\".  The work on differential operators interprets their actions on  monomials in terms of paths or directed graphs, which may represent a very general class of combinatorial objects, which include those arising from continued fractions.  The work on bin-packing algorithms applies methods from permutation enumeration to study the behavior of certain bin-packing and dual bin-packing algorithms.  The theory  of hypergeometric series gives a well-understood way of dealing with certain types of identities, but there are many identies that are not of this form, of which the Bernoulli numbers and related sequences are among the most interesting.  The investigator studies these identities, with a view to developing general ways to deal with them.\r\n\r\nThe investigator studies topics in enumerative combinatorics, an area of mathematics that involves counting the number of ways that various kinds of operations can be performed, or the number of objects of a particular type that can be constructed.  This area of mathematics has many applications to the analysis of computer programs, and also has applications to statistics, physics, chemistry, and communications.  This work extends techniques for solving several different kinds of enumeration problems.  One of the topics, for example, shows that the analysis of a method for efficiently filling containers with objects of various sizes is closely related to the enumeration of certain kinds of permutations. \r\n",
