The investigation will use neutron scattering methods to study the effect of confinement in disordered porous glasses on the properties of helium. If interest are (1) the role of disorder and confinement on the superfluid phase where previous studies have already shown that the macroscopic changes induced by confinement are mirrored in the microscopic dynamics; (2) the effects of confinement on the phase separation that occurs in 3He-4He mixtures where macroscopic studies have shown that the tricritical point becomes a regular critical point; and (3) the structure of the solid phase when confined in porous media where preliminary studies have shown that disorder stabilizes the bcc phase over a much larger region of the phase diagram than in the bulk. Neutron scattering measurements, such as elastic and inelastic scattering, provide a powerful probe of the microscopic dynamics of these systems. Properties such as the atomic structure, collective excitations, and single particle momentum distribution can be readily probed using these techniques. The research involves collaborations with workers at the Institut Laue Langevin (Grenoble, France), and the ISIS spallation source at the Appleton Rutherford Laboratory (Oxford, UK), as well as neutron sources in the US. The research provides excellent training for graduate students in a fundamental research area using state-of-the-art instrumentation.\r\n%%%\r\nThe quantum fluids helium-3 and helium-4 provide a unique 'laboratory' for the study of strongly interacting assemblies of particles obeying Bose and Fermi statistics. Neutron scattering measurements, such as elastic and inelastic scattering, provide a powerful probe of the microscopic dynamics of these systems. Properties such as the atomic structure, collective excitations, and single particle momentum distribution can be readily probed using these techniques. This project seeks to understand how disordering bulk helium or helium mixtures influences the fluids' properties. Disorder is introduced either through the addition of impurities, by immersing the fluid in highly porous aerogel or Vycor glass, or through thermal fluctuations. Neutron scattering experiments uniquely and sensitively show that a number of the fundamental properties of helium are changed by the disorder. The research involves collaborations with workers at the Institut Laue Langevin (Grenoble, France), and the ISIS spallation source at the Appleton Rutherford Laboratory (Oxford, UK), as well as neutron sources in the US.
