 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many male animals produce rhythmic songs that attract females for mating. Males are often aggregated and structured choruses result where males either alternate or synchronize their calls with those of neighbors. Several hypotheses have been forwarded to explain chorus structure, suggesting, for example, that males cooperate so as not to confuse females. These ideas have not proved true and an alternative, that males compete to jam competitors calls, has been supported. This competition is driven by a widespread (including humans) precedence effect whereby females respond to only leading calls. Males, then, compete to produce leading calls. We do not currently know how these precedence effects and male signaling strategies function in natural choruses and what benefit females derive (i.e. better genes) by mating with leading callers. Advances in digital technology will allow recording of large choruses in nature and analysis of relative call-timing strategies. Multi-speaker playback experiments utilizing computer-simulated choruses will be used to examine female mating preferences under natural conditions.\r\n\r\nThe findings of this study will increase our understanding of the operation of sexual selection in nature and the evolution of animal communication systems. Determination of the variance in, and the effects of density etc. upon, female preferences and male signaling will help us understand better the mechanisms that maintain genetic variance in populations, an issue important to both evolutionary and conservation biology.\r\n",
