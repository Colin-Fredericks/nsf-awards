This work has as a common t hread the use of high energy (sometimes polarized) electrons and gamma rays to probe matter and the universe.  The work will be in three main areas.  The major work will be the completion of data analysis and publications for Experiments E155 and E155x t o measure polarized deep inelastic electron scattering from polarized proton and neutron targets to extract the quark and gluon spin distributions in the nucleons.  The high intensity and high polarization of the SLAC electron beam together with robust and highly polarized targets makes possible precise measurements of the spin asymmetries that provide unique and important information on the proton structure of the nucleons. Precise measurements make possible stringent tests of QCD theory from comparisons with next-to-leading-order calculations of spin structure, evaluation of the fundamental Bjorken sum rule, and extraction of the strong coupling constant at low momentum transfer.  Another major area of work will be the preparation for the data run for experiment E158 using the high intensity polarized electron beam to measure parity violating asymmetry in electron-electron scattering.  This high precision data will provide important tests of the Standard Model at low momentum transfer in the electron magnetic coupling via the interference between exchange of virtual photons and Z bosons. The American University Group will contribute to the design and implementation of the magnetic spectrometers, data acquisition system, and to the spectrometer calibrate ion systems. The third area of work will be to contribute to the development of the detector systems for GLAST, the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope, an international project that proposes to launch a new generation large acceptance gamma ray observatory in a satellite for\r\ngamma ray astrophysics measurements. The American University Group has joined the GLAST collaboration and will organize and help conduct the extensive calibrations of the prototype and eventually the full detector in the electron and gamma ray beams at SLAC.\r\n",
