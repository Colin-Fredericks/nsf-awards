 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) project at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, John F. McDonald, P.I., entitled Remote Distance Learning for Design of Fast SiGe HBT Computer Circuits.  This project will employ an exciting new technology to empower students to learn how to design digital systems involving complex, high clock frequency computers and other circuits on a scale never before possible, and to enjoy the laboratory experience from remote locations, any time of the day.  In particular, to provide access to an exciting new supercomputer technology, employing a novel electronic materials system, Silicon Germanium (SiGe), in the form of Heterojuntion Bipolar Transistor (HBT) circuits.  The project involves creation of SiGe versions of circuits known as Field Programmable Circuit Boards (FPCB's), and Field Programmable Gate Array's (FPGA's).  The approach makes feasible the rapid prototyping of supercomputer circuits that would have been too expensive by other approaches.  This technology strengthens the student's ability to conceptualize these large, high speed systems in the abstract, virtual environment of inexpensive laptop and desktop computers, and university workstations and servers.",
