 "awd_abstract_narration": "The household decision to allocate output between consumption and savings is one of the most important determinants of business cycles and economic growth. Consumers purchase roughly two thirds of national output annually, and recessions often are amplified and sometimes are caused by reductions in household demand for consumption goods. As an example, the leading candidate for the cause of the 1991 - 92 recession is a decline in consumption demand, yet the cause of this demand shift remains poorly understood. The difference between household consumption and income, savings, determines the supply of resources available for new investment, which together with investment demand determine the price of new investment- the interest rate of the economy.   To understand business cycles and growth, then, requires understanding the forces that drive household decisions to consume and invest. This grant pro-posal describes empirical and methodological projects that construct and estimate models of consumer behavior and build these into structural models of aggregate consumption. These models will give a structural understanding of the role of uncertainty and precautionary saving in aggregate consumption fluctuations.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for three main reasons. First, the proposed methods deliver consistent estimation of consumption and asset allocation behavior even in the presence of precautionary saving effects or liquidity constraints. The majority of the literature to date, largely due to the noise inherent in household measures of expenditures, estimates models which are not robust to predictable fluctuations in the variance of consumption.  Second, these projects will evaluate the importance of the precautionary motive for saving across different households and time periods. In addition to simply being of interest for predicting and understanding movements of consumption, studying precautionary saving will yield both information about and tests of structural models of imperfect consumption insurance. Third, aggregation from household-level estimation will yield a better understanding of consumption movements in business cycle models, changes in the U.S. saving rate, and the importance of imperfect insurance for aggregate consumption and asset returns. By actually placing the estimated structural model into a general equilibrium framework, this research will provide a more realistic \"consumption function\" that represents the optimal consumption decisions of the heterogeneous population of households in the U.S. The model can improve inference concerning other features of the macroeconorny.\r\n\r\n",
