Jackson\r\nTexas A&M University\r\n\r\n\r\nThis study analyzes the effects of environmental contamination on commercial and industrial real estate decisions and the value of these properties, and fills important gaps in existing scientific research and literature, which has primarily focused on residential properties. Two complementary research tasks address the effects of contamination on: (1) the risk perceptions of key real estate market participants; and (2) the sales price and value of contaminated, or previously contaminated, properties.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the first research task involves surveys of real estate mortgage lenders and equity investors with respect to financing and investing in contaminated properties. These surveys gauge general lender and investor concerns about contamination related issues, as well as specific adjustments to credit underwriting  and equity investment criteria corresponding to the perceived risks associated with environmental contamination. The second task involves an analysis of the effects of contamination on the sales price of commercial and industrial properties. In this analysis, sales data is statistically analyzed to discern the magnitude of, and conditions for, adverse price impacts due to contamination. These tasks consider the clean-up status of the properties, general market conditions, and the provision of indemnifications against future environmental liabilities.\r\n\r\nThis research has broad implications for a range of private and public economic and financial decision making. Commercial and industrial real estate represents significant assets for communities and business entities. The effects of contamination on investment and lending risks, and real property asset values, impact local government tax bases as well as the viability of the businesses and corporations that have an ownership interest in these properties.\r\n\r\nFurther, these issues are of critical importance to public policy initiatives attempting to facilitate the redevelopment of contaminated sites, or \"brownfields.\" Most of these sites are industrial or commercial properties, and these property types have largely been ignored by existing scientific research. Without adequate theory and empirical research on the risk effects and market perceptions with respect to the effect of contamination on these properties, policy initiatives may prove ineffective and unnecessarily costly.\r\n",
