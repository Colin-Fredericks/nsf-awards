 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875367\r\nBohringer\r\nThere exist important applications that are difficult or impossible to realize with current technology. For example, the following two items are directly related to NSF strategic areas: (a) techniques to efficiently move, sort, or mix small particles (e.g. cells in biotechnology applications); (b) methods for massively parallel assembly of microfabricated components (e.g. for advanced manufacturing technology of high resolution display or imaging arrays). Towards the general goal of micro manipulation we identify three major directions along which we pursue our research:\r\n(1)\tmicrofluidic manipulation of parts;\r\n(2)\tmassively parallel micro assembly; and\r\n(3)\tcomputational tools for modeling and simulation.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build practical devices for micro manipulation, and to develop the underlying scientific concepts and enabling technologies. Microfluidic manipulation is the basis for analysis and synthesis devices in many biotechnology applications. Parallel microassembly is an enabling technology that will allow the efficient manufacture of a new generation of complex microsystems from simpler or standard components. In analogy to the development of ICs, the growing complexity of microsystems will require sophisticated computational tools for modeling and simulation.\r\n\r\nOne of the key items on the educational agenda of this project is to provide students with hands-on engineering experience and with training in state-of-the-art technology.  Our new MEMS laboratory provides opportunities to perform exciting research at undergraduate, masters, and PhD. level. The newly developed class \"UWEE 539: Micro Electro Mechanical Systems\" that the P1 will teach for the first time in Fall '98 will emphasize practical, interdisciplinary training in microtechnology, and it will provide the students with a cooperative learning experience. Working in MEMS labs at Cornell, Stanford, and Berkeley has taught the P1 that in this interdisciplinary field of research teamwork is extremely important. Students will be guided to work in teams organized for example by role (designing and testing - checking and verifying), or by complementary field of expertise.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
