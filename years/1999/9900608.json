 "awd_abstract_narration": "Historically, popular mobilization has centered around economic interests with labor unions serving as the primary vehicle for political action. However social movement scholars have identified new forms of mobilization in recent decades which focus instead on non-material goals such as environmental protection. These \"new social movements\" contrast with their traditional counterparts not only in their goals, but also in their organizational structure, class make up and culture. Social movement and class theorists are in disagreement as to how these new movements should be conceived of in relation to the traditional class antagonists and what political alignments will emerge among them. Using labor unions and environmental organizations as the basis, this doctoral dissertation research  will examine both the conditions which influence relations between these \"old\" and \"new\" movement organizations and the process by which these relationships develop. The first stage of the study involves a national survey of state labor federations in order to determine the status of labor/environmental relations around the United States. Data from the survey will be used to test several hypothesis regarding the influence of political, economic and organizational factors on the type of relationships which develop. Then, using relevant contrasting cases as determined by the survey, six states will be selected for a comparative case study designed to examine the process of relationship development between these two movement sectors. Through interviews with relevant actors and the use of organizational documents a more precise understanding of the forces governing the relations between \"old\" and \"new\" social movements will be determined.",
