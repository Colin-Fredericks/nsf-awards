 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  - Marcum  AST 9973812\r\n\r\nThe main aim of this project is the construction of an observational, near-infrared wavelength (0.9-1.8 microns) stellar spectral library of moderate (~1-5 Angstroms) resolution.  This spectral library will be used for exploratory investigations in combining these data with existing optical data, for possible future applications in stellar population studies of galaxies.  The project has a well-defined goal and thus will produce a tangible \"end product\" (e.g., the spectral atlas) which has potential for use in crossdisciplinary applications, such as comparison of theoretical stellar model atmospheres and the identification of currently unknown near-infrared (near-IR) opacity sources in cool stellar atmospheres.\r\n\r\nAn advantage of this project is that the feasibility of obtaining high-quality near-IR spectra for a large number (~200) of stars has already been demonstrated. However, as this is one of the first attempts to produce \"template\" spectra characterizing the \"average\" near IR features in a particular stellar type, the project will involve the creation of innovative techniques to accomplish this necessary task.  While this is common practice for optical spectra, problems in \"averaging\" a set of spectra to produce a \"template\" near-IR spectrum are related to the large number of absorption features in that part of the spectrum, and the lack of a true \"continuum in cool stars which could be used to normalize the spectra. It is further anticipated that techniques will have to be developed to \"splice\" the near-IR data with existing optical data, since no standardized method of accomplishing this task exists.  The fact is that some of the necessary data already exists.  This means that undergraduate student assistants can begin learning how to reduce the data immediately (software has already been created to facilitate data reductions).   The development of solutions to these potential problems can begin even before any additional data is collected.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported by funds from the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
