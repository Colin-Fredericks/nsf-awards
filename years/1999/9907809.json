The areas included in this research for 1999 include: 1) basic processes in fully and partially ionized plasmas; 2) microwave generation and microwave/plasma interaction; 3) intense electron and ion beams; 4) high energy density plasma and applications; 5) industrial/commercial applications of plasmas; 6) plasma diagnostics; and 7) pulsed power and other plasma technology applications. A detailed listing of the sub-areas can be found in the enclosed Conference Announcement.\r\n\r\nDue to rather tight travel budgets on most university research grants, few graduate students and new researchers attend these meetings. We wish to encourage increased attendance by this group at the meeting to be held in Monterey. We are seeking funds for travel and per diem for graduate students and new researchers to be selected by Professor Ronald Gilgenhach, Graduate Student Travel Grants Chairman. These funds will be processed through the IEEE conference account \"IEEE 1999 ICOPS\" which is subject to audit by IEEE.\r\n\r\nWe have several aspects of this meeting, which we feel are innovative and add to the attractiveness for travel support for this new research group. Advanced concepts on vacuum electronics and microelectronics, new computational methods in simulations of plasmas and electron beams, advanced plasma processing of materials and flat panel displays, fusion innovations are being carried out and in which increased interest is present. We hope that the cross-fertilization and increased attendance of conference attendees in the vacuum electronics and pulsed power areas will enhance the conference as well as the value to the new researchers attending the meeting.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this conference precedes the IEEE Pulsed Power Conference so we hope to attract a large diversity of participants. Our plenary talks at the meeting will also reflect the diversity and basic science nature of the ICOPS plasma community.\r\n***\r\n",
