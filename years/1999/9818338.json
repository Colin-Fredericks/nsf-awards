This instrumentation will support research in new paradigms, system architectures, and algorithms for network computing involving distributed multimedia systems, mobile Internet agents, geographic information systems (GIS), and data mining and information search over the Internet.  The research in distributed multimedia systems is investigating scalable server\r\narchitectures, specification of QoS measures, and mapping of QoS measures to resource allocation and scheduling decisions.  The research in agent-based Internet computing focuses on programming abstractions and their underlying mechanisms for secure and robust agent-based computing.  Several agent based applications are being investigated by this project, including a multimedia based active mail system.  The research activity in GIS is investigating parallelization and other approaches for efficient execution of range query and map overlay operations.  This research, together with the activities in distributed multimedia, is addressing QoS problems for the presentation of graphics and images resulting from GIS queries.  The research in data mining is investigating parallel algorithms for large data sets obtained from various Internet sites.  The synergy among the various activities of these projects is realized through several\r\nfocal-point applications.  These applications are related to agent-based multimedia mail system, Digital Earth initiative, and the Sky Survey project.\r\n\r\n",
