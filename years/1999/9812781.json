 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) typically behave aggressively towards\r\nmembers of other groups; such aggression occasionally includes lethal\r\nattacks. Among mammals, such coordinated lethal aggression has been\r\nreported for a limited number of other species, including humans and\r\nseveral social carnivores. Most hypotheses attempting to explain this\r\nlimited distribution have focused on benefits gained from resource\r\ncompetition, whereas the lethal raiding hypothesis focuses on the costs of\r\naggression, which are predicted to be low for species with social bonds\r\nand variable party size. It has proven difficult to choose among these\r\nhypotheses, largely because the events of interest occur rarely and are\r\ndifficult to observe systematically. This study will be the first to test\r\nthese hypotheses using field experiments in addition to naturalistic\r\nobservations. Playback experiments and behavioral observations will be\r\nconducted in Kibale National Park, Uganda. In each experiment, the long\r\ndistance call of an unfamiliar male will be played from a concealed\r\nspeaker, and the subjects' responses recorded. Playbacks will be conducted\r\nto parties of varying size and composition at the core and periphery of\r\nthe community's range. Behavioral sampling will test whether chimpanzees\r\nmodify grouping and vocal behavior in border areas. Because any\r\noutnumbered individuals would risk attack, the lethal raiding hypothesis\r\npredicts that near borders, chimpanzees will travel in larger parties when\r\npossible, and when in small parties will avoid giving long distance calls.\r\nResource competition models do not predict a consistent increase in party\r\nsize or call suppression at borders, because risk of attack depends on\r\nabundance and distribution of resources, which vary considerably over\r\ntime. Data also will be collected on ranging behavior, including the\r\nfrequency of border visits and patrols, and the rate of encounters and\r\nvocal exchanges between groups. As the first experimental study of\r\nintergroup aggression in chimpanzees, this study will provide an important\r\ncontribution to understanding the evolution of a behavior pattern which\r\nprofoundly affects the lives of several species, including our own.\r\n\r\n",
