Morse\r\nTitle: Factors affecting performance in foraging\r\n\r\nThis project assesses the role of differential foraging experience in determining an individual's lifetime production of successful offspring. Previous work has shown that individuals vary greatly in their ability to choose hunting sites that provide access to the most prey.  The juvenile stage is a major source of experience potentially affecting the foraging efforts of the all-important adult reproductive stage.  This work examines the periods following emergence from the nest sac and preceding pre-adult molt, using the crab spider Misumena vatia, a sit-and-wait predator that hunts for insects on flowers.  Spiders of known foraging history will be exposed to various hunting sites (different species of flowers, etc.), and then tested on thus-familiar and novel substrates to evaluate the carryover of such experience.  Laboratory and field experiments are incorporated into the research.\r\n\r\nThe work is important in commencing to dissect the factors responsible for differential success among individuals, focusing on a factor likely to be of greatest importance in establishing what traits are maintained in a population, thereby driving the evolution of behavior.  The behavior adopted may determine how effectively a species can exploit available resources, in turn affecting the characteristics of coexisting species, as well as the biodiversity of biological communities.\r\n",
