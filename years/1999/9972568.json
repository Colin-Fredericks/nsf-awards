 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational geometry began with the promise of unifying the multiplicity of efforts to solve geometric problems arising in diverse areas of computation such as statistics, biology, robot motion planning, graphics, image analysis, virtual reality, and data mining. In two decades, the field has produced a rich collection of tools for solving algorithmic problems of a geometric nature.  A recurring feature in the design and analysis of geometric problems is the strong link between the computational and combinatorial aspects of the questions under investigation. Understanding the combinatorial geometry behind the problem is fundamental to being able to find an efficient solution.  This project will explore combinatorial problems arising in geometric contexts in order to develop new tools and to refine tools already available for the design and analysis of geometric algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to develop powerful combinatorial tools which can be utilized to construct simpler and more efficient algorithms. It may be that there is considerable additional cost to analyze the complexity of these algorithms but this cost will be transparent to the end user.  The project will also investigate techniques that would make it possible to obtain more realistic estimates on the behavior of geometric algorithms on typical inputs. This might be accomplished, for example, by identifying some metrics that capture the \"badness\" of a data set. Such a metric might be able to distinguish worst-case situations from ``typical'' ones, and provide an easy a priori \r\nestimate of how well a given computational procedure can handle a specific class of inputs.\r\n\r\n",
