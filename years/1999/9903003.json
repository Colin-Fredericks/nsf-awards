We will accomplish this\r\nwith an integrated major- and trace-element, Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf isotopic, and\r\nU-Pb geochronological examination of two important components of the Duluth\r\nand Beaver Bay intrusive complexes of the MRS in northeast Minnesota: (1)\r\nlayered mafic intrusions; and (2) large granophyric (hypabyssal granitic)\r\nbodies that have been intruded into the upper levels of the complexes. \r\nThis portion of the MRS rift is critical for detailed study because (1)\r\nmuch of the entire upper crustal section, including complete volcanic\r\nsequences and shallow magma chambers, is exposed which will allow us to\r\nexamine the genetic relationships between the intrusive and extrusive\r\nunits; and (2) this region contains numerous felsic units that are\r\nvolumetrically important in both the volcanic sequences and in the\r\nintrusive complexes.  The genesis and timing of these felsic units is still\r\nnot completely understood and will be a major focus of this proposal. \r\nConstraints on the petrogenesis, evolution, and ages of the layered mafic\r\nand granophyric intrusions will help refine an integrated model for the\r\nevolution of the Midcontinent Rift System.\r\n",
