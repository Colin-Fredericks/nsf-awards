 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the further development and continuing expansion of the frozen tissue collection of  the Department of Herpetology, California Academy of Sciences (CAS).  The Department of Herpetology will obtain one ultracold-temperature freezer with an auto-dialer alarm system and tissue storage supplies.  The Department will be able to continue their policy of routinely securing tissue samples from freshly acquired specimens.  As the Department's staff and field associates engaged in collecting efforts worldwide, with particular mention of remote localities in Africa and Asia, the Department is aware of the potential value that these tissue samples may have to the scientific community.  With that in mind, the Department is committed to making tissues available to the scientific community.  In fact, the majority of tissues collected are used by the extramural scientific community, not for the ongoing research programs of Department researchers.  The additional freezer will also greatly facilitate the integration of the herpetological tissues (over 5,000 stored in the Osher Molecular Laboratory (CAS) facilities with the Department's tissue collection.  Concurrent with the physical recuration of the Molecular Laboratory's tissue samples, the Department will incorporate the associated data, now kept in the Molecular Laboratory's unindexed hand-written log, with the main computer database.  This will enhance their ability to serve the scientific community by making specimen and data retrieval highly efficient.  Further, upon completing the integration and computerization of the Molecular Laboratory tissues, the Department will add a searchable tissue database to their website, allowing remote access for the scientific community.",
