 "awd_abstract_narration": "Richard Stratt of Brown University is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to extend his applications of the Instantaneous Normal Mode (INM) theory by the introduction of anharmonicities and nonlinearities in liquids.  Stratt hopes to transcend the limitations of his previous linear, harmonic picture for liquid dynamics while still retaining enough of the language of modes to permit an understanding of the molecular mechanisms.  In doing so Stratt seeks to broaden the short-time INM approach and bring it closer to resolution with the long-time hydrodynamic ideas.  Stratt will also seek to examine the molecular origins of two-dimensional Raman spectroscopy which owes its existence to nonlinearity and the intrinsic anharmonicity that exists in liquid motions.\r\n\r\nThe question of the influence of solvents on the dynamics and outcome of chemical reactions is of central importance to chemistry, given that most chemical reactions in nature and in chemical industry occur in the presence of solvents.  Stratt's research will help to gain a better understanding, on the molecular level, of the factors that determine the way the properties of a solute are  influenced by the presence of surrounding solvent.",
