 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the investigation of the sources of marine natural products for which a symbiont origin has been claimed by use of novel methods developed for the study of symbiotic associations. In addition to three studies in progress that involve lithistid sponges, pyridoacridine alkaloids in sponges and jaspamine, six related studies will be carried out involving either specific metabolites or general classes of chemicals that were selected for potential impact on marine biology and biotechnology.  Further chemical investigations of lithistid sponges are expected to yield new cyclic peptides and glycopeptides with molecular weights in the 1500-2000 Da. range.  Molecular genetics will be used to determine the relationships between symbiotic filamentous bacteria that produce different cyclic peptides.  Novel chemical structures from marine invertebrates will also be identified.\r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. D. John Faulkner of the Marine Research Division of the University of California, San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  Professor Faulkner will carry out chemical studies of marine invertebrates that will provide unique opportunities to discover new natural products and to investigate their ecological and evolutionary roles.  A basic hypothesis that guides this research is that secondary metabolites have contributed to the evolutionary success of the organisms that produce and/or use them.  This research will probe areas of marine natural products chemistry that may impact marine biology, ecology and biotechnology.",
