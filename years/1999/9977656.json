With Major Research Instrumentation program funding, the PI will create a unique nuclear magnetic resonance system, capable of producing both extremely high magnetic fields and ultralow temperatures.  The foundation of the proposed system is a 15.8 Tesla / 120 mm room temperature bore superconducting NMR magnet, recently purchased by Yale University.  The NMR-quality specifications of this magnet, combined with its super-wide bore diameter and its strong field, open up entirely new experimental frontiers.  The Major Research Instrumentation funds will be used to acquire the other components necessary to complete the system: an active shielding upgrade, a custom NMR spectrometer, and ultralow temperature experimental cryostats.  The research activities that will be conducted with this system span several different fields, academic departments, as well as two universities, Yale and Columbia. These projects include:  1) the study of nanoscale materials, e.g., epitaxial thin films of GaN, GaAs quantum wells; 2) magnetic resonance microscopy of small biological samples (such as mice and rats); 3) the effect of optical pumping on the spectra of certain biological samples, to address long-standing questions about the efficiency and specificity of photoreactions in the photosynthetic reaction center; 4) extending a wide-variety of solid-state NMR measurements down to ultralow temperatures, to boost sensitivity and to simplify spectra.  The improved instrumentation will enhance research training experiences for students, postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate, in several ways, including hand-on training on state-of-the-art instrumentation and the results of research projects carried out with this instrument finding its way into the classroom.\r\n\r\nFunds from the Major Research Instrumentation program will be used to acquire components that will be used to complete the state-of-the-art NMR system.  The system will be used by a range of researchers within the university as well as at nearby universities.  It will also have an impact on the research training of students, from post doctoral to undergraduates\r\n",
