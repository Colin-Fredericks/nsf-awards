We have made progress on collapsed\r\nmanifolds of nonpositive sectional curvature, including the\r\nexistence of the local splitting structure. We have made progress\r\non Gauss-Bonnet-Chern type theorems for noncompact manifolds as\r\nwell as the topological invariants associated to a sequence of\r\ncertain collapsing metrics. We will continue our programs in\r\nthese areas in the near future. We will also begin to investigate\r\nstructures of collapsed manifolds with bounded diameter and a\r\nlower curvature bound. This represents a continuation of work\r\nproposed three years ago for NSF Grant DMS 9626252.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important developments in Riemannian geometry in\r\nthe last two decades is in the understanding for the Riemannian\r\nmanifolds which appear to be smaller than their actual\r\ndimension. For instance, the surface of a very thin donut looks\r\nlike a circle. A major part of my research focus on such\r\nmanifolds whose curvature are also between the curvature of two\r\nspheres of different radius. We have found restrictions on the\r\ntopological structure of these manifolds. Our progress is\r\namplified by the amazing fact that among all manifolds whose\r\ncurvature are between the curvature of two spheres of different\r\nradius, all but finitely many appear to be smaller than their\r\nactual dimension. Therefore, we have made progress on the study\r\nwith a long history: the manifolds whose curvature are between\r\nthe curvature of two spheres of different radius.\r\n",
