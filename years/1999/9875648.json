Educational activities emphasize practical hands-on, inter-disciplinary learning by designing and implementing low-cost embedded systems in university laboratories.  The objective of the research is to automate the analysis and fine-tuning of an embedded system's temporal properties to facilitate debugging of timing errors.  Automation is achieved by designing a prediction mechanism that uses a combination of measured data, desired requirements, and theoretical models to predict what fine-tuning operations can aid in correcting the errors.  A computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tool incorporates the methods, to make the research available to embedded system programmers.  The impact of the integrated research and education plan is that more engineers will be available to fill the demand for embedded real-time software developers. Through education, more students will have hands-on experience with embedded systems, thus better preparing them for work in industry. Through research, better tools will enable engineers with expertise in other areas to implement their applications, even without an in-depth background in real-time systems theory. Together, development time for embedded systems can decrease and quality can be improved, ultimately leading to a lower cost for embedded system products.\r\n",
