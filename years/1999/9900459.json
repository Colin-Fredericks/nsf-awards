 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hard and wear-resistant coatings are an important segment in the US and world economy; for instance, machine tools are a $15 billion per year industry worldwide.  The focus of this research program is to fabricate ultrahard coatings based on mixed amorphous/nanocrystalline (e.g., Si3N4/TiN composite coatings) phased by ion assisted pulsed laser deposition method for manufacturing applications.  A lubricant will be added to reduce the friction coefficient.  The research aims to elucidate the understanding of the mechanisms controlling processing structural and micro-mechanical relationships in nanostructured coatings and thereby demonstrate routes for improved mechanical properties with engineered interface and surface modification.  The state-of-the-art analytical techniques will be used to evaluate the structural and mechanical properties. \r\n     The above results will be related to the mechanical and tribological properties of the coated surface, such as:  critical load, elastic modulus, and friction and wear behavior against a variety of counterfaces in dry and lubricated atmospheres. The principal investigator will also involve a  local high school teacher and student into the experimental works related to the research. Through this outreach activities, both the teacher and student will learn the fundamentals of the scientific principles involved as well as learning the different experimental tools related to thin film processing of materials.  The efforts will be  made to work with industry to achieve the objectives of the  research.  Results of the project will be disseminated by  presentations in regional and national conferences, and published in journals.\r\n",
