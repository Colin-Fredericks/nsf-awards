The groundwork consists of gaining the necessary background in seismic data processing through reading, coursework, and training, becoming knowledgeable about progress in computational intelligence over the past three years and acquiring the necessary hardware and software to conduct the research.  The work will be divided into three phases: study of seismic processing with a particular focus on types of seismic attributes; re-acquiring knowledge of the current state of neural network research and other forms of computational intelligence; and applying neural network processing to seismic data with focus on reservoir property predictions.  Because of the PI's extensive involvement in the implementation of a new general education curriculum and administrative responsibilities as the head of the Commission on the Status of Women, she has been removed from active research for the past three years.  Her research area is geophysical data.  For most of her career she has focused on electrical and electromagnetic geophysical techniques.  She will re-establish her research program by moving into a new research area and learning about seismic data processing and how computational intelligence techniques such as neural networks can best be applied in that area.\r\n",
