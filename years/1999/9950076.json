 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powerful Partnerships for Integrating Academics into the Manufacturing World is a project that seeks to transform a successful, ongoing regional Manufacturing Technology Academy into a flexible and adaptable technological academy model that lifts students from the traditional high school or technical center setting into a more meaningful educational environment that delivers high level academic content while emulating a corporate culture of quality. Although the academy currently focuses on the manufacturing industry as the theme around which its academic concepts are woven, almost any industry can serve as the skeleton for this model. The technological academy model differs from the mainstream of both technology centers and traditional high schools in four key aspects: 1. A rigorous academic curriculum which integrates high level secondary content like calculus, chemistry, economics and physics into a workplace focus. 2. A uniquely-successful manufacturing council partnership structure that ensures constant communication and in-depth collaboration between teachers, manufacturing personnel, liaisons and students. 3. An innovative blend of classroom and workplace that extends the classroom beyond its walls and brings an entrepreneurial spirit and corporate culture to its students and curriculum. 4. Marketing, recruitment, evaluation and replication strategies aimed at continuously improving effectiveness and opening the technological academy door to an exponentially larger and more diverse pool of students by generalizing the model for ease of replication and adaptation. \tIt is precisely these departures from mainstream educational practices (both academic and vocational) that have already infused enthusiasm, meaning, commitment and \"spark\" into the MTA experience. The Powerful Partnerships grant proposal would intensify the learning for MTA students and greatly expand the student participant pool so that many more students can develop academic and technical skills in an integrated and meaningful way.",
