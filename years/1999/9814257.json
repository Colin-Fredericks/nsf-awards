 "awd_abstract_narration": "Black Lion Tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysopygus) are only found in the\r\nAtlantic Forest of the Interior in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  This\r\nspecies of New World primate exhibits a form of social organization that is\r\nprimarily monogamous and thus stands in sharp contrast to the social\r\nsystems of the majority of primate species.  Additionally, this species is\r\ncurrently distributed across an array of forest fragments of different\r\nsizes, not unlike the postulated distributions of many New World primate\r\nspecies at the height of the last glaciations of the Pleistocene.  Finally,\r\nthe black lion tamarin is part of a species complex that includes three\r\nother taxa, all of whom are interrelated in ways that are not entirely\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will allow the investigators to (1) determine the effects of a\r\nmonogamous social system on mating patterns and the dispersal of genetic\r\ntraits within populations; (2) examine the effects of a species' range\r\nfragmentation on the dispersal and distribution of genetic traits among\r\npopulations; and (3) estimate the evolutionary relationships among the\r\ndifferent lion tamarins, with particular reference to the position of the\r\nblack lion tamarin.  In accomplishing these three goals, we will expand our\r\nknowledge of the genetic and evolutionary consequences of primate social\r\norganization by adding a new system, monogamy, whose effects upon the\r\ndistribution of genetic traits and the dynamics of evolutionary genetic\r\nchange remain largely unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
