 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971852\r\nBurke\r\n\r\nTwo topics are proposed for study: (1) the variational analysis of \r\neigenvalue functions and (2) non-parametric population analysis. In the \r\nfirst topic the principal investigator will apply modern techniques of  \r\nnonsmooth analysis and variational geometry to study the variational \r\nproperties of certain functions of the spectrum on the space of  n x n \r\ncomplex valued matrices, e.g., the spectral abscissa and the spectral \r\nradius. In the second topic, the principal investigator intends to analyze \r\nand develop algorithmic solution techniques for the non-parametric \r\nversion of the basic problem of population analysis. Specifically, the \r\nprincipal investigator intends to use maximum likelihood techniques to \r\nestimate the underlying probability measure associated with population \r\nvariability.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the variational behavior of the spectrum of matrix valued \r\nmappings is essential to our understanding and control of discrete and \r\ncontinuous dynamical systems. Such systems arise in numerous practical \r\napplications ranging from the design of structures that can withstand a \r\nmajor earthquake to flight control for modern aircraft. The results of the \r\nprincipal investigator's research program are intended to make possible for \r\nthe first time the derivation of optimality and/or equilibrium conditions for \r\nnumerous problems associated with spectral variations that occur in \r\nnumerous engineering applications. On the other hand, population analysis \r\nis the statistical methodology used to understand inter-subject variability \r\nin studies designed to analyze a phenomenon associated with a targeted \r\npopulation. For example, the methodology is widely used in \r\npharmocokinetic studies since it is the key to understanding how drugs \r\nbehave in humans and animals. The principal investigator intends to \r\nanalyze and develop algorithmic solution techniques for the non-\r\nparametric version of this problem. The goal is to incorporate these \r\nalgorithms into a software package now being developed by the Resource \r\nFacility for Population Kinetics at the University of Washington.\r\n",
