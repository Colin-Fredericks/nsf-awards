 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant to the Department of Science & Technology Studies at Cornell University for a graduate student conference on Technology & Identity to be held April 16-18 at Cornell University. Peers and colleagues from Science & Technology Studies, Psychology, Communications, Sociology, Anthropology, American Studies, German Studies, History, and Government will participate in untangling the term \"identity,\" and how it relates to technology. 12 papers have been selected and will be presented at the conference. The speakers will be organized in four panels of three speakers each, with 20-30 minute for the presentation and a 5 minute follow-up question period for each speaker. The three paper presentations for each panel will be followed with a 5-10 minute presentation by a commentator (all commentators will be graduate students in Cornell's Department of Science & Technology Studies). 45-60 minutes of discussion will immediately follow each panel on general themes running through all three papers. The panels are titled: Media, Masses, and More: The construction of users of technology, Perceptions and interpretations of user-internet interactions, Public and Private Identities, and Medicalization and Identity. In addition, Kenneth Gergen, who is the Gil and Frank Mustin Professor of Psychology in the Department of Psychology at Swarthmore College, has agreed to deliver the keynote address. Breakout sessions will be held to continue discussions begun earlier in the conference. Each breakout session will be 2 hours long, and conference participants will be able to choose among the sessions. Session titles will include, but will not be limited to, the following: Constructed (and constructing) identities on the internet, Actual vs. Virtual users of technology, Advertising and Identity, Interpretations of identity, Strategic uses of identity and technology, Disease identity. These sessions will address issues raised by speakers on different panels, questions left unanswered in general discussions, comments made by the keynote speaker, and crosscutting themes that deserve extra time and consideration.",
