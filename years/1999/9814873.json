The researchers will be undertaking a study of  neutron-rich nuclides in the mass 100 to 130 u range for nuclear astrophysics.  These experiments are motivated by astrophysical theories, which predict that the \r\nr process, one of the major processes of stellar nucleosynthesis, produces much lower abundances for the nuclides in the mass 100 to 130 u range than are actually observed.    \r\nThe researchers are attempting to produce nuclei farther from stability, and closer to the r-process path, than have ever been produced before, and to study their half-lives, decay modes, and level structures.  Measurements of their masses are also important, but cannot be done at present for very short-lived nuclei to the accuracy needed for r-process predictions.  The researchers plan to use the radioactive nuclear beam (RNB) facility of RIKEN to produce the nuclei of interest.  Although it is unlikely they will observe all the nuclei through which the r-process path proceeds in the mass region of interest with the proposed experiments, the predicted yields for the RIKEN facility suggest that they should come close to that region.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  Results of the research have the potential to produce a major step forward in the world's understanding of the r-process and, therefore, of the stellar conditions in which it operates.  This research advances international human resources through the participation of younger scientists and graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.\r\n***\r\n",
