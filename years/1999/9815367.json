Foremost among the questions to be addressed is: what is the role of gene flow in divergence?  Gene flow is the result of migration between populations and its mark is visible in DNA samples.  This work will generate simulation-based tools for the analysis of DNA data using two different statistical approaches: maximum likelihood and method of moments.  Maximum likelihood will work best for small datasets and moment methods will work best for large ones.  The resulting computer programs will be made available to empirical workers.\r\n\r\nBiology is the science of the future and, if we are truly to understand biological systems, historical analyses are more important here than in any other science.  This work will provide a framework for resolving the critical question: how has speciation occured?  For within-species data, it will allow us to identify the forces that have caused populations to diverge.  There are many theories of divergence and speciation, yet these have never been tested because DNA sequence data have only recently become available.  This work will allow biologists to extract historical information from the growing stores of DNA sequence data.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
