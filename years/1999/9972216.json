The scalable parallelism inherent in such applications coupled with their computational demands make them ideal candidates for SMPs and clusters of SMPs.  These applications are highly dynamic and have novel requirements such as the need for temporally indexing the data produced by the application.  There is a mismatch between the abstractions commonly available for parallel programming and such requirements, leading to a considerable effort on the application developer both in terms of correctness and performance.  The goal of the proposed research is the design and evaluation of parallel programming abstractions, runtime mechanisms, and resource management algorithms suited to the needs of such complex applications.    In particular, the following contributions are expected:  (a) Design and evaluation of high-level parallel programming abstractions, and the evaluation of the tradeoff between performance and programmability in using such abstractions, (b) Design and evaluation of runtime mechanisms (such as time management and distributed garbage collections) for implementing such abstractions efficiently in a cluster, and (c) Design and evaluation of application-conscious resource management mechanisms in a cluster. \r\n",
