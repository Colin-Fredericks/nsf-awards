By replacing more expensive access to a \"far away\" data with a more efficient access to a \"near by\" cached copy, and by coordinating the content of caches, these techniques improve the overall system performance and scalability.\r\n\r\nCooperative caching techniques have bot been used for transactional object systems.  A principal goal of the proposed work is to design, implement and evaluate cooperative caching techniques for transactional object storage systems.  These techniques will enable construction of wide-area storage systems that will provide applications with the reliability and consistency guarantees of transactions, the flexibility is user-defined objects, and still be scalable.\r\n\r\nA major contribution of this work will be a set of new transactional cooperative cache consistency protocols for wide-area environment, global cache coordination protocols that adapt to object granularity, and security techniques that protect objects in cooperative caches.  The technique will be incorporated into the Thor object storage system.  This work encompasses both early research and development and prototyping.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
