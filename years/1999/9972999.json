 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with the improvement of secondary school education in\r\nscience and mathematics. Previous research by ourselves and others has\r\nshown the value of engaging students in interactive self-assessments and\r\nproblem solving while learning science and mathematics. However it has\r\nproven difficult to disseminate these techniques to teachers for a\r\nvariety of reasons. A new technique of dissemination will be attempted,\r\nusing the World Wide Web (WWW) and internet technologies. The technique\r\nalso ties into state and nationwide movements toward assessments to\r\nachieve and maintain standards. In order to assist teachers in preparing\r\nstudents for these assessments we will place interactive problem solving\r\nactivities on the WWW. These questions and activities permit student\r\nself-assessment of progress and teacher assessment of class progress while\r\nstudents are learning before the students take the \"standards\"\r\nexaminations. The exercises themselves will be developed by\r\nhighly experienced teachers, who will also be available by email to\r\nsupport classroom teachers using the WWW based learning activities. The\r\ntechnique will be tested by developing exercises that are coordinated\r\nwith the State of Washington's Essential Academic Learning Requirements,\r\nwhich provide the basis for the State of Washington assessments for\r\nscience and mathematics. The results will be evaluated by comparing the\r\nstatewide assessment scores obtained by students and classes who have or\r\nhave not used the WWW based learning activities.\r\n",
