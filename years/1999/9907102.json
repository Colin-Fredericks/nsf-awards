The robot will emulate an animal foraging for resources while avoiding threats.  Foraging search is a general-purpose search method applicable to finding sparse resources in a vast, dynamic and non-stationary environment. The specific approach to this problem involves learning causal relations between neutral cue stimuli and affective stimuli from resources (or\r\nthreats). In this study the PI will statistically evaluate learning efficacy as it effects success in finding resource objects in a large arena when those resources are movable and relations are non-stationary. Learning is based on a unique, multi-time scale learning mechanism, the adaptrode, which has previously been shown to solve the destructive\r\ninterference problem.  In this problem, new knowledge may overwrite or interfere with previously learned knowledge. In non-stationary environments relations may change over time causing a learning system to eradicate knowledge of older relations.  But, in such environments, the old relations might prove to be valid over longer time scales. With\r\ndestructive interference, the learner has to relearn what it had previously known. The adaptrode can maintain short-, intermediate- and long-term memories, even of contrary relations. The research project will involve at least three undergraduate students in all phases of the work. It expects to stimulate students' interests in research and to enhance their learning experience in general. \r\n",
