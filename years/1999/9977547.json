It will be able to produce a 0.1nm probe at 100 keV and 0.3 eV emission width on a routine basis, and to detect electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra and energy-filtered diffraction patterns with close to 100% efficiency.  The instrument will have complete digital control, be both flexible and easy to operate and be accessible over the net.  The instrument will provide much enhanced detection of core-edge spectra thus improving sensitivity limits for, e.g., determination of submonolayer impurities at interfaces, interface electronic states, enhanced zone axis Z-contrast mapping and increased sensitivities and precision at currently accessible levels.  The development of this instrument is a collaboration between Cornell University and Nion, a company based in Kirkland, WA.  Nion was formed to develop the know-how developed by the principals, Drs. Krivanek and Dellby, in constructing the first successful corrector on an electron probe instrument.  After construction, the instrument will be brought to Cornell to serve the 80 faculty groups carrying out undergraduate and graduate level materials research at the university.  It will be located close to the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility in a new building designed for Advanced Materials research and will be made available to external users as part of the Cornell Center for Materials Research outreach program.  Problems at the frontier of materials science will be studied using this instrument.  It will provide knowledge of local electronic structure at or close to the atomic scale to furnish essential insights into the properties of interfaces, grain boundaries and other nanostructural features of real materials that affect the properties.  Substantial undergraduate research opportunities will be offered.  The instrument will also feature in programs with local and other schools within the context of the Cornell Center for Materials Research K-12 outreach programs.   \r\n\r\nA new instrument will be developed with funds from the Major Research Instrumentation program that will provide a probe size that will allow studies of the electronic structure at or close to the atomic scale to furnish essential insights into the properties of interfaces, grain boundaries and other nanostructural features of real materials that affect the properties.  This instrument will be located at the Cornell Center for Materials Research where it will have a large impact on the infrastructure, both in terms of research and education.\r\n\r\n",
