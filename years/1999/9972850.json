 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to think abstractly about the components of a computer program is critical for computer science students.  Students who have not developed this ability tend to view a program as an unstructured collection of statements and expressions.  This project provides the opportunity for computer students to think abstractly about components of a computer program as functions in terms of what they do and classes in terms of what they represent.  The purpose of this activity is to enable students to cope with the complexity of large programs. To accomplish this goal a set of debugging and analysis tools are being  developed to visualize and validate programs.  \r\n\r\nA prototype preprocessor and debugger for simple Java programs is being developed and tested by first year computer science students.     By using these new tools, students are expected to develop superior programming skills early in their academic studies.  The following activities are possible for students:  1) to be able to include pre conditions and post conditions for functions as comments in Java code;  2) to be able to represent invariants and abstraction for classes as comments in Java code;  3) to have the pre and post conditions of functions checked automatically by the debugger; 4) to have the invariant representation of a class checked automatically by the debugger; 5) to view objects abstractly throughout the debugging process; and 6) to use abstract notation to create objects for test cases during debugging.\r\n\r\nConditional upon a successful proof-of-concept evaluation using the tools with students, the PI intends to develop a national dissemination plan.  \r\n",
