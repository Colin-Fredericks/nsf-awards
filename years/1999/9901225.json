Bay \r\nInstitution:  Utah State University \r\n\"Improving SASW Dispersion Measurements with Source Correlation and Receiver Arrays\" \r\n\r\nThe Spectral-Analysis-of Surface-Waves (SASW) method is a seismic technique for determining engineering properties of shallow soil and rock deposits.  It involves generating seismic waves at the ground surface and monitoring the motions of those waves with a number of receivers positioned on the ground surface.  One difficulty that is often encountered in SASW testing is that seismic energy from other sources, such as traffic, industrial facilities and even wind in trees is also measured by the receivers.  This unwanted seismic energy, or noise, contaminates SASW measurements and can lead to erroneous results.  This proposed research is to investigate two approaches to minimize the influence of noise on SASW measurements.  These methods should improve the quality of SASW measurements.   \r\n\r\nThe first proposed approach is to use source correlation.  This involves measuring the force applied to the ground by the SASW source, and correlating that forcing function with the signal measured at each receiver.  By repeating the measurement and averaging the correlated functions, the noise level in the SASW measurement will be decreased.  An additional benefit of using source correlation is SASW testing is that it will allow a statistical determination of the quality of experimental results. An added benefit to using this approach is that with source correlation, coherence functions calculated between the excitation function and each receiver will accurately quantify the spectral distribution of noise at each receiver.  With this information, the relationship between coherence level, number of averages, and the confidence interval of the measured phase can be determined statistically.  With this relationship an operator performing SASW testing will be able to determine how many averages will be required to achieve a desired measurement accuracy based upon the coherence level.   \r\n\r\nThe second approach is to reducing the influence of noise the use of receiver arrays to minimize the effects of noise on surface wave dispersion measurements.  A receiver array is a geometric distribution of number of receivers connected in series, so that signals from all the sensors are summed.  For decades, exploration geophysicists have used receiver arrays to minimize the effects of surface waves (which geophysicists refer to as ground roll) in deep reflection surveys.  By using different spatial distributions of the sensors, receiver arrays can be designed that will selectively measure the surface waves and eliminate noise emanating from points other than the source location.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research will result in higher quality SASW field measurements.  In addition, accurately quantifying noise levels in SASW measurements will provide a valuable tool for future research in assessing the resolution of final SASW results.   \r\n\r\n",
