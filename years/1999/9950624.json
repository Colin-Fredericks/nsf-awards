 "awd_abstract_narration": "In May 1998, the science faculty developed a new mission statement which commits us to an inquiry-based approach throughout our curriculum. The objective of this proposal is to align our science education courses with this mission. We will directly address problems that are ubiquitous at similar institutions: a lack of collaboration between science and education faculty, a deficiency in inquiry-based science instruction for pre-service teachers, and absence of a proper space for such methodology.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this aim, we will create a classroom/laboratory, housed in the sciences building, to allow for inquiry-based learning for pre-service teachers. Adapting national and local curricula, pre-service teachers will design experimental modules centered around a unique ecosystem, Great Salt Lake, and create a web-based dissemination program for the curriculum. A resource center, with equipment for checkout by pre-service and practicing teachers, will be created. Ownership of the experiments and access to equipment will ensure that the teachers we certify, who largely remain in the vicinity, can implement the curriculum modules they design.\r\n\r\nIn addition to web-based dissemination, we propose collaboration with the education division of the Utah Museum of Natural History. Elementary pre-service teachers will implement their modules by instructing in the Museum's long-standing 4' grade educational programs. Both elementary and secondary pre-service teachers will also implement their modules in field placements for their science methods courses.\r\n\r\nThis curriculum change will cement the relationship of the science programs and the School of Education, affecting not only the elementary and secondary education science methods courses, but also significantly connecting the faculty of both disciplines. The long-term impact will be a population of teachers who have a deep understanding of the scientific process.\r\n",
