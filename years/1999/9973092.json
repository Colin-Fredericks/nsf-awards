 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dramatic growth in the popularity of the Internet, coupled with the increase in user access\r\nspeeds, has led to an increased demand for streaming media services in IP networks.  However, the\r\nheterogeneous and decentralized nature of the Internet, and the lack of end-to-end mechanisms for\r\nquality-of-service guarantees, significantly hampers the effort to provide quality delivery and low\r\ndelay to all clients.  The success of multimedia streaming applications hinges on developing new\r\ntechniques for providing both low start-up delay and high audio/video quality, without requiring\r\ncontrol over the entire path from the multimedia source/server to the end users.  We propose an\r\napproach based on active proxy services and prefix caching that has the potential of satisfying these\r\nrequirements.  Proxy prefix caching is a mechanism whereby the first several seconds of a continuous\r\nmedia (CM) object are stored at a proxy server close to a client.  The prefix cache allows the proxy\r\nto hide latencies introduced by either long end-to-end delays, the need to mask unreliable network\r\nservices, the need to process the stream arriving from the source, or the need to deal with scarce\r\nresources between the proxy and clients.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                In this proposal the researchers outline research investigating several aspects of this mechanism which in-\r\nclude:\r\n\r\n-Design and evaluation of preix caching mechanisms,\r\n\r\n-Integration of prefix caching with bandwidth smoothing,\r\n\r\n-Development of effective resource allocation schemes at the proxy, and\r\n\r\n-Characterization of video sources and Internet traffic to feed into the these investigations.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                              The joint participation of AT&T Research and the University of Massachusetts provides a unique\r\nsynergy that would not otherwise be possible.  AT&T provides access to resources in the form of\r\nWorldNet traffic data, which supplies a snapshot of current CM workloads in the Internet, and\r\naccess to video testbed/prototyping platforms that are not readily available in academia.  On the\r\nother hand, UMass provides a much more long-term perspective than is possible at an industrial\r\nlab, as well as expertise in the area of active services, bandwidth smoothing, and reliable transport\r\nprotocols.",
