 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although considering the dynamic behavior of buildings and bridges is of fundamental importance in modern structural design, undergraduate civil engineering students seldom develop an understanding of the way that these structures respond when acted upon by time-varying loads. Because this topic is of great social and economical importance, there is an unmet need in current civil engineering programs to provide more formal training in structural dynamics and earthquake hazard mitigation to undergraduates. Further, many students in non-engineering disciplines would learn from exposure to basic concepts in earthquake engineering. Therefore, over 20 institutions drawn from the three national earthquake centers are adapting the idea conceived at the centers of using bench-scale shake tables to integrate earthquake engineering into the undergraduate curriculum. Students learn these principles through the introduction of a series of experiments throughout their coursework. Both classroom demonstrations of effective techniques in structural design, and \"hands-on\" experiments on scaled specimens at all levels have a significant impact on the entire civil engineering curriculum. The program has been strategically planned to achieve the goals set forth, and is headquartered and managed at Washington University. Each university associated with the project has selected a task associated with the project that matches the interests and capabilities of the identified investigator. Additional experiments are being developed specifically for non-engineering students who have an interest in the consequences of severe seismic events (architects, geologists, etc.). The outcomes of the program include a series of experiments with test specimen designs and lab manuals, a set of videos, and a CDROM. All of the resulting experiments will be distributed to interested parties and made available on a web site. Additional opportunities include nationwide student competitions and undergraduate research experiences. Plans are in place to reach a significant number of students from underrepresented groups, including both undergraduates and school children. \r\n\r\n",
