The workshop is organized by David B. Shmoys of Cornell University jointly with Joseph Cheriyan of the University of Waterloo and Michael Goemans of CORE, Belgium, all part of a distinguished international organizing committee. \r\n\r\nWorkshop topics reside on the interface between theoretical computer science and mathematical programming/operations research.  This award will help to support fourteen junior and senior researchers in the subject area.  Through small group interaction and a variety of topics, those selected to attend will be afforded the opportunity to meet and discuss current issues with senior panel members and colleagues. It is also anticipated that the workshop will lead to future collaborative efforts between workshop participants.\r\n*** \r\n",
