As a group, these seals are among the dominant top predators in Southern Ocean ecosystems, and the fluctuation in their abundance, growth patterns, life histories, and behavior provide a potential source of information about environmental variability integrated over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. This proposal was developed as part of the international Antarctic Pack Ice Seals (APIS) program, which is aimed to better understand the ecological relationships between the distribution of pack ice seals and their environment. During January-February, 2000, a research cruise through the pack ice zone of the eastern Ross Sea and western Amundsen Sea will be conducted to survey and sample along six transects perpendicular to the continental shelf. Each of these transects will pass through five environmental sampling strata:  continental shelf zone, Antarctic slope front, pelagic zone, the ice edge front, and the open water outside the pack ice zone. All zones but open water will be ice-covered to some degree. The objective of this component of the APIS program is to investigate the genetic diversity among widely dispersed populations of the four species of Antarctic ice seals and to examine the phylogenetic relationship among the species. Microsatellite techniques will be used to explore heterozygosity patterns within each species and to relate these patterns to known life history characteristics. Mitochondrial DNA analysis will be used to examine the sequence of divergence between the four species. Additionally, this component will coordinate genetic sample analyses through a collaboration with the University of Alberta, Canada. Better insight into the interplay among pack ice seals and biological and physical features of Antarctic marine ecosystems will allow for a better prediction of fluctuation in seal population in the context of environmental change.\r\n\r\n",
