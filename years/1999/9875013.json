 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cook's research explores new allylmetal chemistry from a nucleophilic as well as an electrophilic viewpoint.  Nucleophilic allylmetal species are well-known, but few if any act as nucleophiles toward other C-C pi bonds such as alkynes.  In fact, involvement of an allylindium in a competitive reaction with a terminal alkyne and an ester showed a distinct preference for reaction with the alkyne.  Further exploration of the factors controlling this reaction will be forthcoming from Cook's laboratory.  Electrophilic allylmetal chemistry is afforded by (pi-)allylpalladium species.  Professor Cook's group has devised a scheme whereby ring-opening, reversible, and catalytic formation of an allylpalladium results in epimerization of a stereogenic center to a single configuration.  Linking this process with nucleophilic addition to the transient allylpalladium has the potential to provide elaborate polyfunctional intermediates for elaboration into such products as optically pure non-natural amino acids.  Professor Cook's teaching initiative is highlighted by efforts to involve college chemistry teachers in a summer research program, including representatives of the Tribal Colleges.  Additionally, web-based instructional media are slated for further development, to include molecular animations in addition to an already-popular web site that offers course notes, general resources, and an anonymous mail form to enhance communication between student and professor.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research and teaching efforts of Dr. Gregory R. Cook of North Dakota State University.  Professor Cook's research deals with novel, fundamental chemical reactions that are employed for the construction of deceptively simple molecules that are often used in the pharmaceutical industry.  The fundamental nature of the processes being studied means that they could prove to be highly significant and have broad impact in chemistry.  Professor Cook's teaching initiatives include exposing teachers at small colleges (including the Tribal Colleges) to the excitement of scientific discovery in the laboratory setting, and developing communications and teaching tools that employ the latest web-and internet-based tools.",
