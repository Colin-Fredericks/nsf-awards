These assertions involve\r\nsequential constructions of finite graphs and trees, where at each\r\nstage a feature of the construction is minimized.  This is in some\r\nanalogy with the so called ``greedy'' constructions in computer\r\nscience.  The assertions tell us that such constructions can be\r\nperformed in such a way that the resulting object has strong and\r\nnatural combinatorial properties related to Ramsey theory (a branch of\r\ncombinatorics).  These combinatorial statements are provable from\r\ncertain large cardinal assumptions, but not from the usual axioms of\r\nmathematics.  Results in this connection from prior NSF support were\r\nused as an integral part of an undergraduate course in the computer\r\nscience department at UCSD.  In addition, under prior NSF support,\r\nFriedman has discovered a new kind of elementary constraint on\r\nsequences from a finite alphabet.  For each finite alphabet, there is a\r\nbound on the length of any sequence satisfying this constraint.  In one\r\nletter, this longest length is 3. In two letters, this longest length\r\nis 11. In three or more letters, this longest length is demonstrably\r\nincomprehensibly enormous, and is closely connected to various topics\r\nin mathematical logic and combinatorics.  These topics include fast\r\ngrowing functions, provably recursive functions, fragments of Peano\r\narithmetic, and proof theoretic ordinals.  This topic was explored by\r\ngifted high school students this past summer at the University of\r\nChicago, where students came up with 11 for two letters.  Friedman will\r\ncontinue his investigation of this and other related problems\r\ninvolving such simple constraints.  In this connection, Friedman has\r\nbegun a fruitful collaboration with Randy Dougherty that involves\r\nsubstantial computer exploration.\r\n     Friedman has managed to establish the independence from the usual\r\naxioms of mathematics of some remarkably concrete combinatorial statements.\r\nThese involve the construction of finite mathematical objects subject to\r\ncertain constraints. The assertions tell us that such constructions can be\r\nperformed so that the resulting object has properties of a kind that are\r\nnormally studied in combinatorics.  Results in this connection from prior\r\nNSF support were used as an integral part of an undergraduate course in\r\nthe computer science department at UCSD.  In addition, under prior NSF\r\nsupport, Friedman has discovered a new kind of elementary constraint\r\non sequences from a finite alphabet.  The longest length of a sequence\r\nsubject to this constraint (for a three-letter alphabet) is\r\ndemonstrably incomprehensibly enormous, and is closely connected to\r\nvarious topics in mathematical logic and combinatorics.  This topic was\r\nexplored by gifted high school students during the summer of 1988 at the\r\nUniversity of Chicago, where students came up with the correct number\r\nof 11 for an alphabet of two letters.  Friedman will continue his\r\ninvestigation of this and other related problems involving such simple\r\nconstraints.  In this connection, Friedman has begun a fruitful\r\ncollaboration with Randy Dougherty that involves substantial computer\r\nexploration.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
