 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics is a pivotal course for those wishing to pursue any science or engineering career.  To do well in physics requires proficiency at solving problems, and problem-solving proficiency in turn requires that one possess a rich arsenal of conceptual and procedural knowledge as well as the ability to reason analytically.  Yet, studies indicate that the problem-solving habits of students are not effective for developing the analysis skills needed for integrating conceptual knowledge into the problem-solving process.  Despite many recent efforts to emphasize the importance of concepts, most students finish introductory courses with the view that problem solving in physics consists of finding and manipulating equations.  These formulaic problem-solving approaches are inefficient because: 1) without a conceptual knowledge structure to which they can be tied, equations are quickly forgotten after the course; 2) memorizing equations does not develop the analysis skills that are needed to decide when or how particular equations apply to specific physical situations; and 3) students fail to appreciate how a few powerful principles can be used to solve a wide range of problems. We are engaged in a proof-of-concept project to design and pilot test a platform-independent, web-based environment called the Physics Analysis Workbench (PAW) aimed at engaging students in a range of analysis processes to help them actively integrate conceptual knowledge into the problem-solving process.  PAW constrains students to perform conceptual, strategic, and quantitative analyses of problem situations using the representations, principles, concepts and procedures that are used by skilled problem solvers.  The goal of this proof-of-concept phase is to accumulate evidence of the effectiveness of the pedagogic approach underlying the design of PAW.  We are developing a delivery shell and a prototype set of problems with tutorial support materials.  This system and materials are pilot tested in our introductory courses with engineering and physics majors.  Exam performance, as well as other standard measures, of students using PAW are compared to course norms to determine the impact of the system.",
