The effect of the cylinder flowfield on the mixing rate of the spray is assessed by comparing cases with known flow characteristics (controlled by a shrouded intake valve) with results from a totally quiescent case.  The latter is achieved by deactivating the intake and exhaust valves and undergoing several compression/expansion strokes before injecting the fuel; this allows the fluid motion to dissipate while retaining the time variations of temperature and pressure and the moving boundaries of the baseline engine configuration.  Mixing is evaluated by tracking the evolution of the fuel vapor distribution as measured by planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF).  To ascertain whether lean quenching of the flame is a significant source of hydrocarbon emissions, simultaneous PLIF measurement of the present fuel and of hydroxyl radial are performed.\r\n \r\nThe educational program concentrates on the restructuring an existing instrumentation laboratory course to use a problem-based approach.  In the first part of the course the students are given general information about instrumentation and data acquisition systems; for the majority of the semester, they are given a series of increasingly difficult problems which they must diagnose experimentally.  The program includes training of instructional personnel and assessment of the efficacy of the problem-based approach to a laboratory course.\r\n\r\n",
