 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project that is supported by this award concerns the development and \r\napplication of mathematical methods for the formulation, analysis and \r\nsolution of material processing system models. Specifically, the aims \r\nare to examine time-dependent sharp-interface solidification models, \r\nphase-field models, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) models. \r\nThe general goals of the projects are to examine simple model problems \r\nto determine the process sensitivity to the operating conditions, describe \r\nthe scientific phenomena of heat, mass, and momentum transport within \r\nthe system, and to elucidate the coupled dynamics of these transport \r\nmechanisms.  This will include the investigation of time varying evolution \r\nof solidifying fronts and concentration profiles in a two-dimensional \r\nconfiguration, a multi-parameter asymptotic expansion approach for \r\ninvestigation of phase-field models, and an asymptotic approach for \r\nthe investigation of a stagnation flow CVD reactor and development of an \r\nevolution equation for the gas/solid interface of the deposited film.  \r\n\r\nThis award will support research that deals with the verification of mathematical models\r\nthat are pertinent to industrial material processing. Solidification is\r\na common phenomenon in an industrial setting. It describes the state change \r\nfrom liquid to solid. Experimentally, it has been observed that the \r\nsolidification process yields solidified surfaces which are\r\ndendritic (finger-like) in nature. Computer simulations also show these structures.\r\nThe correctness of these simulations still lacks verification. The\r\nfirst two parts of the work will address this very issue on a mathematically \r\nrigorous basis. The third part of this work concerns thin film formation as related to\r\ndesigning high performance materials. One such process for making this\r\nfilm is called Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). Mathematical models for the \r\ndeposition reactors are often complex, and computer simulations are typically \r\nused to extract useful information from the mathematical models. The research will\r\nresult in simpler models which can be studied in more detail. A complex computer \r\ncode can then be verified  against the simpler models for correctness.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
