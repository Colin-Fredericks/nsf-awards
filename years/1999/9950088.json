It is enhancing the comprehension of the interdisciplinary nature of a career in aviation maintenance technology (AMT) by students, including women and minorities, reducing the training costs by maximizing the adaptiveness of the curriculum, and improving laboratory safety with minimized environmental hazards, via a coalition of a two-year college, a four-year university, a high school, professional associations, and the software and aviation maintenance industries. The project is (1) developing five simulation modules, each targeting a particular aspect of aviation maintenance technology in the two-year associate degree programs; (2) field-testing the AMT simulation system in two-year college aviation maintenance classes on its pedagogical effects and economy on an ongoing basis complemented with confirmative tests; (3) introducing the developed AMT simulation system and the technology of developing similar simulations to AMT faculties at two-year colleges via teacher workshops with participants recruited nationwide; and (4) disseminating the simulation system via both the Internet and CD-ROM to two-year college AMT faculty and high schools counselors throughout the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
