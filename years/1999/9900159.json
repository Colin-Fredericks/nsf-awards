Specifically, write-field gradient and rise-time effects, signal stability, demagnetizing and thermal effects, novel medium design, and probe technology will be examined.  System performance will be quantified through system capacity, signal to noise ratio, signal degradation over time, and impact on state-of-the-art data encoding strategies.  The proposed work includes: quantifying the impact of applied fields, time, and temperature on read signals; expanding existing system simulations; developing experimental techniques to estimate parameters in our medium model; developing, simulating, and experimentally verifying models that relate system performance to medium and head models.  The work involves a unique interplay between experimental studies, simulations, and theoretical studies to assess impacts of component changes on system performance.  This broad research plan builds on years of research effort and the combination of the investigators' strengths.\r\n\r\nResearch at Washington University on magnetic information processing has been a detailed study of the physics of magnetic recording system components, coupled with information theoretic analysis that views magnetic information storage and retrieval as a communications system, and with model-based evaluation of system performance.  This work, together with cognizance of new results, techniques, and tools as they appear, yields insights into the limits imposed on information processing capacity by the physics of system components.  Such knowledge can point to new approaches not subject to present limits, and serves to assess their promise and prospects. As researchers continue to propose both evolutionary and radically new magnetic recording system designs, the utility of and need for a versatile and reliable guide among the many options and directions is apparent.  This proposal builds on research previously funded by NSF through the NCR and ECS programs, and funded by NSIC, ARPA, Department of Commerce (ATP), and industry to put together a systems-oriented research program in magnetic information systems.\r\n\r\nCentral to much of this work is the measurement, modeling, and analysis of waveforms resulting from the magnetic microstructure of the medium.  This microstructure effectively processes the written signal, and the synthesis of new systems should be guided in part by this processing.  The medium magnetization is peak-limited, nonlinear, hysteretic, and granular.  The very ability to retain information recorded also ultimately limits a medium's potential performance.  The dependence of system performance on varying fundamental medium parameters such as exchange coupling, anisotropy energy, granularity, and film thickness will be pursued.  Using more powerful analytical tools to model these medium effects, the performance of systems designed to compensate for repeatable medium noise effects will be quantified.  Signal degradation due to applied field, time, and temperature, is quantified using unique experiments developed using the magnetic force microscope arid recording testers at Washington University.\r\n\r\nA physically based simulation of magnetic recording systems, including media, read heads, and write heads has been developed.  This computational model forms a bridge between theoretical and experimental research.  Many of its features have been verified by comparison of its simulations with VSM and spin stand measurements, including some fairly detailed recording procedures.  The model has now reached a stage of development where it is envisaged as a tool for system synthesis.  As the tool is refined, it must be kept modular so that new head designs, new media, and new signal processing blocks may be incorporated easily, and their interactions evaluated.  It must retain an ability to simulate single realizations of media and corresponding waveforms, and to run Monte-Carlo simulations to predict system level performance for a variety of performance metrics.  This model will be expanded: to predict signal dependence on applied fields, time, and temperature; to include current communications signal processing techniques used and proposed for magnetic recording channels; to include perpendicular and patterned media models; and to incorporate models for probes such as the magnetic force microscope.\r\n***\r\n",
