(Illinois Institute of Technology)\r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together two largely-separate communities of scholars, and will seek to create a new field that examines the co-construction of technology and modernity. While the term \"modern technology\" is a staple of popular discourse, the scholars who have most closely examined technology and modernity, respectively, have proceeded largely in isolation from each other. Scholars with backgrounds in philosophy, anthropology, cultural studies, and social theory have created an elaborate and theoretically dense literature that we may call \"modernity studies.\"  Meanwhile, historians, sociologists, and certain economists have created a large empirically grounded literature in \"technology studies.\"  This workshop will confront the barriers that have separated these communities (principally disciplinary jargons and differences in the level of analysis) and develop a joint research agenda. The sustained intellectual work necessary for such an ambitious, international agenda-building effort will require a multi-day workshop, carefully prepared in advance, and significant follow-up activities. We are seeking NSF support to enable 12 U.S. scholars to participate in this effort.\r\n\r\nWe will hold the workshop at the University of Twente, The Netherlands, in November 1999. Twente is especially well situated to be the center for these activities. Not only does the university have comfortable, accessible conference facilities, its departments of Systematic Philosophy and STS have in the last three years grappled with these same vexing issues (of disciplinary jargon and levels of analysis) in developing a joint research theme in \"technology and modernity.\" A semester-long seminar on this theme during Spring 1997 (coordinated by Misa) helped define the most promising intellectual problems for the workshop we propose here. One finding was a growing awareness, in both the modernity and technology studies communities, of the promise of cross-fertilization. A workshop designed to catalyze international collaboration between these two communities is timely. Such an effort, we believe, will have ramifications not only for how we as scholars understand technology's place in the modern world but also for how we as citizens may manage technology in society.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
