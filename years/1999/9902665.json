The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Jennifer L. Sokoloski with twelve months of support to work with Dr. Phil A. Charles at Oxford University in the UK, and for twelve months at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA, working with Dr. Scott Kenyon.  Partial support for this project is provided by NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and their Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics Program.\r\nThis project involves the study of the accretion of matter in binary systems, which are symbiotic systems of white dwarfs and red giants.  Specifically, this involves observation using x-ray, ultraviolet and ground based observations.  These binary systems are important because they might be progenitors of supernovae, which in turn are used to tabulate distances at cosmological scales.  The principal investigator will have access to telescope time in the Anglo-Australian telescope and the telescope in the Canary Islands, with additional telescope time from collaborators in Poland.  She will also be measuring the orbital size of the binary system, which has not ever been accomplished for symbiotics.\r\nDr. Charles is the head of the astrophysics sub-department at Oxford, which is known for both expertise in the field of interacting binaries and breadth of research interests.  Dr. Scott Kenyon is an expert on symbiotic binaries.\r\n***\r\n",
