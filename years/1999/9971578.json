In joint \r\nwork with Chris Herald, he will derive gauge-theoretic formulas for \r\nnew 3-manifold invariants by interpreting representations as flat \r\nconnections and perturbing the flatness equations. Corresponding \r\ninvariants of knots and links were defined by Frohman, Frohman-Long,\r\nand Frohman-Nicas. In joint work with Andy Nicas he will analyze \r\nsome mysterious combinatorial identities arising from computations \r\nfor fibered knots. He will also study the extent to which \r\ncut-and-paste methods can be used to compute the new invariants \r\nin joint work with Chris Herald, Paul Kirk, and Eric Klassen. \r\nThe principal goal in this line of inquiry is to establish a formula \r\nlinking the 3-manifold invariants with the knot and link invariants. \r\nOver surfaces, representation varieties can alternatively be viewed \r\nas moduli spaces of stable bundles, and a study of the geometry and \r\ntopology of these moduli spaces is also proposed. This uses methods\r\nfrom algebraic geometry and will provide an additional perspective\r\nfor understanding other naturally occuring spaces, such as\r\nmoduli spaces of linkages and GIT quotients of Grassmanians and\r\nflag varieties. \r\n\r\nThe principal objects studied by geometric topologists are called\r\nmanifolds. A manifold is a geometric shape which near any point\r\nlooks like Euclidean space. Thus manifolds are all locally the \r\nsame, and in order to distinguish one manifold from another, \r\nmathematicians define invariants which encode the manifold's\r\nglobal properties. To illustrate this point, consider the \r\nfollowing three commonplace objects: a flat sheet of paper, the \r\nsurface of a ball, and the surface of a donut. To a near-sighted \r\ninsect, each of these objects looks the same. From any given point \r\nthe insect can map all nearby points using standard xy coordinates. \r\nThe invariant which distinguishes these three shapes is called\r\nthe Euler characteristic. It is the number you get by triangulating \r\nthe object and counting the number of vertices and triangles \r\nand subtracting the number of edges. For example, the Euler\r\ncharacteristic of a triangle is simply 3+1-3=1. Performing a \r\nsimilar count for each of the three surfaces, you get 1\r\nfor the sheet of paper, 2 for the surface of a ball, and 0 for \r\nthe surface of a donut. This number is called an invariant because \r\nit is independent of the choice of triangulation. One of the most \r\nimportant problems in low-dimensional topology is that of \r\ndistinguishing all 3-dimensional manifolds. Understanding the \r\nglobal structure of these manifolds will have numerous applications \r\nto physics, chemistry and biology. The investigator proposes to \r\nconstruct new invariants of 3-manifolds and to develop methods \r\nfor computing the invariants. The long-term goal is to use the new \r\ninvariants to help in classifying 3-manifolds and knots and links \r\ncontained in them.\r\n \r\n",
