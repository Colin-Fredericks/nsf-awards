 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Secondary Science, Mathematics, Pre service Partnership Program (SSMP3) is a collaborative initiative among several key stakeholders in K-12 and Higher Education in the Central Valley of California. SSMP3 will develop, implement, and institutionalize a comprehensive secondary science and math teacher preparation and support a program geared primarily toward grade 7-12 science and mathematics teaching credential students. The primary elements of the project are (a.) recruitment of potential successful preservice science and math students; (b.) preservice mentoring by university/community college and school district faculty; (c.) early paid field experiences in math and science classrooms (d.) a 5 year academic program that combines pedagogy with content; (e.) university and community college revision and summer field testing of introductory science and math courses take by preservice science and mathematics students; (f.) a clinical model for math and science education methods course delivery that involves the teaming of veteran practitioners from the public schools and university faculty; (g.) a comprehensive content/pedagogy summer institute for the professional development of preservice teachers who are teamed with inservice teachers whereby key elements of revised science and math courses will be piloted and where standards-based classroom curriculum materials common to both the preservice and inservice teachers will be employed; (h.) an intensive mentoring program for science and math teacher interns (i.) a support program for new science and math teachers and interns in science that deals with problems faced by educators in the early stages of their career; and (j.) a program that features hiring assurances from FUSD, California's 4th largest school district, along with likely opportunities in surrounding (Fresno County) school districts. SSMP3 will be a model that is disseminated throughout California and the US.",
