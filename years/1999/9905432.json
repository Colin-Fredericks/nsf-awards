 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation research investigates differences in policy preferences and legislative activities of men and women state legislators as well as the impact of these differences on states' social welfare policies.  Rather than assuming that the observed differences in the attitudes and activities of male and female legislators are solely based in gender, as most previous research has assumed, this research will show that much of these differences arises from differences in the kinds of constituencies that male and female legislators represent.\r\n\r\nA second goal of the research is to show that the institutional organization of the legislature mediates the extent to which women's preferences influence state policy.  Prior work assumes that there is a non-linear relationship between the number of women a legislature and the content of policy outputs.  This literature also posits that the same relationship holds across all states.  The current research demonstrates that the impact of women's preferences varies with the nature of the committee system, the strength of political parties in the legislature, and the distribution of women across the two parties.\r\n\r\nThis research and its hypotheses build on previous empirical analyses that show gender differences in legislators' preferences and behavior, as well as formal models of legislative organization.  Data, needed to test these predictions, are obtained from a mail survey sent to 2,529 legislators in 24 states.  The survey data is supplemented with information on the activities and characteristics of individual legislators, the content of state welfare policies, and the rules and procedures that structure policymaking in state legislatures.\r\n\r\nThe substantive focus of the research is welfare policy.  This is a timely legislative issue where legislators and their constituents likely have opinions on a variety of specific welfare policy alternatives.  The study has important implications for research on women elected officials and,  more generally, representation.  Specifying how the organization of legislative institutions affects the ability of women to translate their unique preferences into policy helps to define the relationship between descriptive and substantive representation.\r\n",
