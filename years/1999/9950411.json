 "awd_abstract_narration": "Few opportunities exist in most undergraduate engineering curricula for students of different disciplines, even within engineering, to work together. An interdisciplinary course of study is bringing together mechanical and chemical engineering students.   This project adapts processes developed and disseminated by the SUCCEED Engineering Coalition and others which focus on stimulating student learning.   These processes are used to enhance the chemical engineering curriculum at Tennessee Technological University.   In particular, the SUCCEED Vertically Integrated Design project at Virginia Tech was used as the basis for this project.  This project will implement a horizontal integration of several disciplines in a high temperature materials course.   \r\n\r\nHigh-temperature materials production is the chosen common basis upon which to design such curricular activities.   Materials processing cuts across the disciplines of mechanical and chemical engineering and is a natural point for integration. Chemical engineering curricula typically focus on processing while neglecting the property and performance criteria of materials. Likewise, mechanical engineering studies typically focus on property and performance objectives. In practice, however, these two disciplines work together to design new processes and materials to achieve manufacture ability and performance targets by relating the factors connecting chemistry, processing, properties and performance.  The goals of this project are: (1) to create a laboratory resource that includes a high-temperature graphite element furnace, solids-mixing, milling and forming equipment to be used to support activities that provide a basis for interdisciplinary learning about process, microstructure, property and performance relationships in materials production; (2) to create an active interdisciplinary learning environment by integrating mechanical and chemical engineering students within a team-oriented inquiry-based setting that offers students the opportunity to design, plan, implement and analyze experiments as well as gain experience working within an interdisciplinary team and between teams to achieve a group objective; (3) to create a high-temperature materials processing thread within the existing curriculum by cutting across the core requirements and supporting laboratories with projects and examples; and (4) to use the proposed facilities to introduce pre-college students to materials research through the University Young Scholars program.  The project  will endeavor to attract minority and female students to research at both the undergraduate and precollege levels.",
