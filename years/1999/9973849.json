This model may then be used to predict overall PAH distribution patterns in sediments, sediment-pore water partition coefficients and associated bioavailability of these compounds.  Such information is necessary for accurate assessment of the environmental risk of contaminated sediments and remediation of contaminated areas.  In addition, results from this work will provide insight into the basic relationships between organic matter reactivity and its physical and chemical properties; such an understanding will prove useful in other, non-contaminant, geochemical studies.  This POWRE proposal represents a new direction in the PI's academic career, into field-based marine research that builds upon strong background in laboratory studies of surface geochemical processes.  As such, it represents a critical stepping stone as a marine science faculty member.  In addition to being research that directly addresses a pertinent scientific question, this work logically leads to broader marine research that integrates field and laboratory approaches.  This POWRE proposal will foster her growth towards that rare scientist who fully integrates field and laboratory studies, and strengthen her position as a tenure-track faculty member at a marine institute dominated by senior male faculty.\r\n",
