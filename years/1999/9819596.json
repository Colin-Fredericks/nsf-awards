Each year it will involve 24 science teachers and 48 of their high potential students in a research experience at the University of Missouri-St. Louis or other collaborating research institutions in the region.  Research areas teachers and students may select from include anthropology, astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, earth science, engineering, physics, and psychology or mathematics.  The research is done with collaborating scientists in a six-week summer program. Participants are prepared for the research experience through formal instruction in data analysis, laboratory procedures, and seminars.  Eight academic-year follow-up meetings at different research sites provide an opportunity for teachers and their student team members to share with program peers and other invited teachers and students.  Transfer of the research experience to the classroom is facilitated by the development of lesson plans relating to the use of the laboratory information from their research experience. An electronic bulletin board will enable continued interaction among participants.\r\n",
