 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to simulate the flow in the Earth's liquid outer core using laboratory fluid dynamic models.  The results of this study will be used, together with geophysical observations and numerical models, to probe the workings of the geodynamo.  Two phenomena important in the geodynamo will be investigated.  The first concerns the origin of large scale motions in the outer core and their relationshop to the three-dimensional seismic structure of the lower mantle.  The investigators will study experimentally the structure of convection in rotating fluid shells with nearly radial buoyancy forces, subject to patterns of boundary heterogeneity inferred from lower mantle seismic structure.  The results will help constrain the nature of core-mantly interaction, specifically how convection in the outer core is affected by the laterally variable conditions at the core-mantle boundary, including variable heat flow, topogrpahy and stable layering.  The results should provide a basis for identifying effects of mantle heterogeneity on the long-term behavior of the core and the geodynamo.  The second project is to apply measurements from laboratory experiments of hydromagnetic turbulent flow to turbulence in the outer core.  The investigators will perform an expermental study of tutbulence generated in a diffrentially rotatin cylinder of liquid gallium in the presence of uniform magnetic fields.  Properties of this magnetic Taylor-Couette flow will be used to estiate the turbulent diffusivity over the range of experimentally accessible paramenter, for extrapolation to conditions in the Earth's core.",
