 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solutions to complex scientific simulations based on partial differential equations use discrete meshes to represent the physical (continuous) domain. Similarly, computer rendering of complex scenes uses these meshes for radiosity calculations. Existing heuristic-based methods do not produce meshes that dependable for 3-dimensional real-world problems that include moving or complex surfaces, or that exhibit anisotropic (direction-dependent) behavior. This project will design, analyze, and implement mesh generation algorithms for these domains that are practical and, where possible, provably good. The technical approach to this task is to use optimization-based smoothing and topological transformations. For anisotropic problems, the project will also develop a firm theoretical basis footing for extending Delaunay triangulations to the anisotropic case. Finally, in three dimensions the project will pursue a firm understanding of constrained Delaunay tetrahedralizations and algorithms for their construction.\r\n\r\nThis project will also be active in integrating research with education. It will contribute to curriculum development and course design in support of a new Computational Engineering Science program being initiated within the College of Engineering at UC Berkeley. This effort will include courses and texts in mesh generation and conjugate gradient-like solvers.\r\n",
