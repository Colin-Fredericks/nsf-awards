By thinking of discrete groups -- such as fundamental groups of compact manifolds -- in terms of their Cayley graphs, one can view them  as geometric objects in their own right.  This viewpoint, which is present throughout the proposal, leads to  some remarkable insights (Mostow rigidity, Stallings' theorem, Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth, etc.) and to the striking fact that many discrete groups (for example word  hyperbolic groups) act in a canonical way on a ``boundary''.  The first part of the proposed research focusses on biLipschitz maps.  A byproduct of the project, if it is successful, will be an answer to the question of when certain aperiodic tilings of the plane (for example,  Penrose tilings) are weakly combinatorially equivalent to the usual square tiling, in the sense that one can  match the tiles of the two tilings so that adjacent tiles are matched with nearby tiles.  The second project addresses  Solv, the only 3-dimensional  Thurston geometry that remains mysterious from a large-scale viewpoint. The  remaining topics concern important issues in the fields of  nonpositively curved spaces (the dynamics of the geodesic flow and the structure of the fundamental group), hyperbolic groups (the topology of the boundary and its relation to group structure),  and Poincare duality groups (the relation between Haken PD(3)  groups and 3-manifold groups).  \r\n\r\nThe proposal has two main themes: symmetry,  classification, and recognition of tiling patterns; and dynamics.  Tilings of the plane and 3-space have been studied intensely for centuries, and the resulting theory is fundamental in many branches of mathematics, as well as in solid state physics (crystal structure).  In the 1970's, mathematicians discovered striking new applications of tilings (especially tilings of hyperbolic space, the geometry underlying a number  of Escher's images),  by using the ``rough'' pattern of the tilings rather than the precise shape of the tiles and their intersection pattern. >From this new viewpoint  two tilings would be considered \"roughly the same\" if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the tiles of one tiling with the tiles of the other so that adjacent tiles in one tiling correspond to nearby tiles in the other.  This is a very active area of research with connections to many areas of mathematics.  Several of the proposed research topics  relate to this: for example it is an open problem if the  tilings associated with quasi-crystal structure are always roughly the same as classical crystal tilings. Another theme in the proposal is geodesic motion -- the  motion of a free particle --  in a certain class of  spaces.  These systems have a long history and provide especially simple examples of  ``chaotic'' mechanical systems; they can also be used to model a system of several billiard balls on a billiard table with circular (or convex) bumpers. The objective here is to describe and classify, at least in  certain classes of examples, all possible trajectories of the system.    \r\n",
