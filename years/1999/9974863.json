 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many species of bacteria employ signaling mechanisms to monitor their own population density and respond by altering physiological and developmental pathways. This process usually entails the release of a soluble pheromone, the local concentration of which provides a measure of cell density. Release and perception of the signaling molecule has been termed quorum sensing. Quorum sensing in a number of gram-negative bacteria is facilitated by production of acylated homoserine lactones (acyl HSL). Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the causative agent of plant crown gall neoplasia, utilizes the acyl HSL N-3-(oxooctanoyl) homoserine lactone to regulate the conjugal dissemination of its primary virulence factor, the Ti (tumor-inducing) plasmid, to other bacteria in the rhizosphere. The current proposal focuses on examination of a unique and essential inhibitory component of the A. tumefaciens acyl HSL regulatory pathway.  For most acyl HSL-type quorum sensors, a pheromone synthase and a receptor protein that also serves as a transcriptional activator are sufficient to impart cell-density-dependent gene expression. However, A. tumefaciens requires a third component, a regulator protein called TraM, to facilitate quorum sensing.  The hypothesis is that TraM forms a noncovalent complex with the acyl HSL receptor, TraR, which prevents the transcriptional activator from binding DNA.  The overall goal of this research is to dissect the interaction between TraM and TraR and to understand how this interaction modulates the activity of TraR.  Biochemical analysis will be employed to examine the inhibitory complex and to determine the effect of inhibition on the activity of TraM and TraR in the presence of acyl HSL.  Mutant TraR and TraM proteins that exhibit altered regulatory phenotypes will be\r\nisolated and biochemically analyzed to correlate in vitro and in vivo activities.  Additional studies will assess the effects of regulation of traM expression and pool size.  This research will not only elucidate a unique aspect of acyl HSL quorum sensing in the important model pathogen A. tumefaciens, but will also contribute to the understanding of cell-cell communication in other species of bacteria.\r\n",
