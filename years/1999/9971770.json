 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large and complex genetic data sets present a great deal of challenges to \r\nstandard data analysis techniques. In many cases, standard methods are \r\ninfeasible or even impossible for analyzing such data. This research\r\nis to develop statistical and computational methods relevant to the analysis\r\nof complex human pedigree data. The first main focus is to solve problems \r\nthat involve large complex pedigrees, multiple polymorphic markers, incomplete\r\ngenotypes, and complex disease models. The second main focus is to study \r\nfurther the Chi-square (CHS) recombination models, to develop new techniques \r\nto incorporate CHS into methods of gene mapping to achieve greater efficiency\r\nof data, and to apply this methodology to study genetic interference in the \r\nhuman genome. Most of the proposed research in this project is to be carried \r\nout using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology. Exploration of MCMC \r\nmethods in human pedigree analysis thus far shows that this methodology is \r\nhighly suitable for estimating probabilities and likelihoods. However, because  \r\nof special features of models and methods appropriate for modern human \r\ngenetics, special modifications to the standard MCMC approach are required\r\nfor this technique to be effective in a variety of genetic mapping problems.\r\nThis project continues the work of making these modifications and exploring \r\nnew applications.\r\n\r\nThe last decade has seen rapid advancements in the field of human genetics. \r\nLarge and complex data sets are accumulating at an incredible rate. Some \r\ndisease genes (most of them are for single-gene simple genetic disorders) have  \r\nbeen identified and mapped. This includes the genes responsible for cystic \r\nfibrosis, Huntington's disease and some breast cancers. This has tremendous \r\nimplication in genetic counseling, genetic testing and screening, drug \r\ndiscovery, and genetic therapy. Identification of genetic factors for complex \r\ndiseases is a far more difficult task. Complex diseases may be genetically\r\nheterogeneous caused by different susceptibility genes, or may be caused by\r\na combination of genes with possible environmental effects. Many common \r\ndiseases have complex etiology, and are believed to be at least partially due \r\nto genetic predisposition. Common diseases such as diabetes, alcohol \r\ndependence, and some forms of cancer are examples of complex disorders. \r\nMethods developed in this research can handle complex genetic models and make \r\nuse of available genetic data fully, thereby increasing the power to map \r\ngenes for complex diseases.",
