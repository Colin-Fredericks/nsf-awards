 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the research and development of a new approach to the analysis and optimization of jump stochastic systems.  This approach is based on combining the uniformization techniques\r\nwith the recently discovered relationship between control strategies that change actions between jumps in continuous time systems and randomized strategies in discrete time systems.  The utilization of this approach will lead to the development of new results for optimization of continuous time jump stochastic systems with multiple objectives.  These results will include the description of the structure of optimal strategies and the algorithms for their computation.  In addition to the results for problems with multiple objectives, it is  expected that this new approach will significantly simplify the analysis of one-criterion problems and will develop new computational algorithms for them.\r\nJump stochastic processes model broad classes of production, service, and telecommunication systems.  If successful, this project will improve the abilities to model and analyze broad classes of such system and to design efficient control algorithms for them.  It will significantly simplify and generalize the existing methods by reducing continuous time problems to much simpler discrete time problems. In addition to the development of fundamental methods, this project will apply these methods to several particular problems\r\nincluding optimization of switching policies for manufacturing systems with stochastic demand, design of replacement and preventive maintenance procedures, and call admission to telecommunication systems with limited bandwidth.  \r\n",
