 "awd_abstract_narration": "CTS-9904328\r\nFazle Hussain/University of Houston\r\n\r\nThe Hussain proposal combines a fundamental investigation of a basic process in fluid dynamics: -- the viscous modification of the field of vorticity filaments associated with i) colliding rings and ii) an elliptical ring -- with the development of an advanced measurement technique: holographic particle velocimetry.\r\n\r\nThe fluid mechanics aspects will have an impact on the processes which are responsible, for example, for fine scale mixing (of intrinsic importance in non-premixed combustion, etc.) and dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy.  The proposed efforts, to further develop HPV, will bring a significant advancement in this unique method to gain an instantaneous snapshot of a flow field.  The proposer and his colleagues have pioneered in the initial development efforts and he is distinctly well suited to pursue this further capability.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the proposer will combine, in this integrated activity, research paths that are of recognized importance in Fluid Dynamics and for which he has been one of the principal pioneers, viz., the evolution of concentrated fields of vorticity.\r\n\r\nThe parallel (and independently funded) numerical simulations of this flow constitute a very important aspect of the investigation's contribution.  The potential difficulties in these computations derive from quite different attributes when compared with those faced by the experimentalists.   Hence, using the two bodies of results in a comparative manner will be of significant importance in isolating/identifying errors and limitations that may characterize each of the separate approaches.\r\n",
