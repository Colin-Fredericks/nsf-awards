 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861270\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project builds on new cooperative intelligent agent technology and proven fault tolerance techniques to improve greatly the reliability of distributed object-computing environments such as the Common Object Request Brokering Architecture (CORBA). The movement toward Distributed Object Request Management (DOM) systems such as CORBA recognizes the need to extend object-oriented computing dynamically into the network. However, these architectures are vulnerable because of the variability of networks and the complexity of distributed interfaces, and they do not incorporate fault tolerance features. Fault tolerance is essential for DOM to he usable in many distributed systems with high value or safety implications.  The goal is to make CORBA fault-tolerant by employing fault-tolerant cooperative intelligent agent developed by Sentar as, adjuncts to the distributed client applications, object request brokers, and object repositories that comprise CORBA implementations. The project will investigate fault tolerance methods for application and abstract levels of interaction that do not impact the CORBA standard or burden non-critical applications.  The objectives are to adapt agent and fault tolerance software components for the CORBA environment, prototype critical aspects of the fault CORBA support agent network, and evaluate reliability under various feasible fault conditions.\r\n     A vast commercial market has developed in recent years for distributed object computing technology and products. Of the market, a significant segment requires highly reliable software for safety and asset protection. If the proposed research meets its goal, users in this critical software segment will enjoy the cost savings and operational benefits CORBA provides to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
