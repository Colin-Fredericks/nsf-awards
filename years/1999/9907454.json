 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Michael Podgursky and the University of Missouri will purchase a computer system including a Sun Enterprise 450 Server and 4 Gateway 450 MHz PCs. The system will allow a group of Missouri researchers to store and analyze administrative data from the state's Departments of Economic Development, Labor and Industrial Relations, Elementary and Secondary Education, Social Services, and Higher Education. It includes information on welfare participation, technical and vocational education, two- and four- year public education, job training as well as numerous other programs, both specialized and general, to enhance the employability of Missouri residents. The database also includes quarterly earnings for all individuals employed in Missouri who are covered by the state unemployment insurance program, the overwhelming majority of workers in the state, as well as from other categories. This information provides a powerful base for the examination of many policy relevant questions.\r\n\r\nSince the mid-1980s researchers and public officials have become increasingly interested in understanding how individuals transit from being out of the labor market into employment and what effects government programs have on these transitions. Two types of transitions that have generated the most interest are the transition from school to work and the transition from welfare to work. Analyses have lead a number of people to question the quality of public schooling in general, and in particular, whether schools are providing children with the skills necessary to move into the modern workplace. In addition, in recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the efforts of both the federal and state governments to move single parents off the welfare roles and into the labor market by providing various forms of training and job search assistance. However questions remain regarding the effectiveness of this assistance and the impacts of these programs. They can be difficult to address because long term data is only rarely available. The Missouri database provides a large systematically collected body of information which can serve this function and this NSF award will provide instrumentation which will permit its effective utilization.\r\n",
