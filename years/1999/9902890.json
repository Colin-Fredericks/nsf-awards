Such differentiation has previously been hypothesized only on the basis of chemical variations through sheets. However, the recent discovery that plagioclase crystals cluster together to form a continuous 3-D network early in the crystallization of slowly cooled basaltic magma provides a means of measuring directly the amount of compaction that has occurred. This network, when initially formed, has a random fabric, but during compaction it can become deformed. The shape of the deformed network is most easily measured in samples that have first been partly melted so as to convert late crystallizing minerals to liquid, which can then be quenched to glass. The shape of the network is measured in serial sections or in CT X-ray scans. Such measurements in the thick Holyoke flood basalt of Connecticut have revealed a pattern of compaction and dilation that matches exactly the pattern indicated by the chemical variation through this flow. In the present research, these same techniques will be applied to a classic differentiated intrusive igneous body, the Palisades Sill of New Jersey. Numerous chemical studies have pointed to compaction having been an important differentiation process in this sill. Measurements of the degree of deformation of the plagioclase network in a vertical section through this sill will indicate directly how much compaction took place during its solidification. If these techniques can be applied successfully to the Palisades Sill, they may have wide application in the study of the differentiation of larger intrusive igneous bodies.\r\n\r\n",
