 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860160\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will show the feasibility of new technology that will allow the fabrication of silicon avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays which can be used for x-ray, charged particle, and optical imaging with improved quantum efficiency at the deep red end of the spectrum (i.e., >60% at 1, um) and at the violet end of the spectrum. The proposed design is based on a modified reach through structure. Improvements for charged particles and photons at the violet end of the spectrum will come from using a new ultra-shallow junction technology. Improvements for x-rays and photons at the deep red end of the spectrum will come from improved configuration and n-type Si with ultra-high resistivity and excellent minority carrier lifetime. Improvements in noise and pixel isolation will come from new technology for junction edge passivation. Improvements in avalanche gain and gain uniformity will come from improved techniques for fabricating the avalanche zone. In Phase I, we expect to prove feasibility by showing that we can maintain the required properties of the n-type Si and by demonstrating that we can provide surface passivation adequate for acceptable pixel isolation.\r\n     There are many commercial and potential commercial markets for Si APDs and APD arrays ranging from simple laser detection, through replacement of photo multiplier tubes for scintillation detectors, to low energy x-ray detection and spectroscopy. A technology which improves the spectral coverage and makes extended arrays possible will heavily impact existing markets as well as creating new market potential.\r\n",
