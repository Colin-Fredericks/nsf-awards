This project develops new compiler techniques to enhance memory performance by improving the utilization of the memory hierarchy.  The research targets both uniprocessor workstations and parallel computers.  New program transformations are devised to maximize the reuse of data which are stored in the fast memory units, such as caches, in the memory hierarchy.  These new transformations handle difficult program constructs which are commonly found in practice but could not be handled previously.  To support the new transformations, an interprocedural analysis is developed to analyze the memory access behavior throughout the program.  The proposed program analysis and transformations are implemented within a research compiler.  Successful development of the are techniques can lead to a significant improvement of the execution speed of a wide range of applications.\r\n",
