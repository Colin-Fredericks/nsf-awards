It is organized into six tasks: (I) Two-dimensional networks and (2) Molecular squares will be prepared at the air/water interface; (3) Preparing and characterizing the precursor metal complexes and addressing factors such as complex stability to hydrolysis and the kinetics of the condensation reactions; (4) Utilizing variables such as temperature, acidity, and reactant concentration, and presence of co-surfactants to tune the interfacial condensation reactions; (5) Characterization of film formation at the air/water interface using techniques to include Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and Atomic Force Microscopy; and (6) Addressing future directions such as films on solid supports, and tuning physical properties.\r\n%%%\r\nMany of the technological applications of nanometer scale objects, such as functional electronic nano-archetictures that include molecular-level probes, transducers, wires, contacts, insulators, and shielding, can be engineered using a \"bottoms-up\" approach involving chemical control of molecular assembly to achieve the synthesis of these functional nanostructures by chemical design. A deeper understanding of the fundamental science is needed to advance these capabiltites. Students trained in these areas will likely face an inviting job market due to emerging industrial priorities that are being driven by global competitiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
