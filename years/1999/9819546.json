The goal is to develop and promote the implementation of educational strategies that can reduce the disparity in achievement between White and minority students in Grade K-8.  The planning project will result in three major outcomes:  3) the development of a detailed plan for conducting a national demonstration project; 2) the formation of an Advisory Board of expert resource persons committed to assisting NABSE in implementing the program from 1998 through 2003; and 3) the development of a plan for establishing the NABSE Information Center on the Academic Achievement of African American Youth.",
