 "awd_abstract_narration": "Waterfront structures include gravity walls, sheet pile walls, and pile supported wharfs which are vulnerable to earthquake damage the response of such structures to strong ground shaking depends primarily on the complex soil-structure-foundation interaction and the undrained behavior of the foundation and backfill soils.  Current philosophy in the design of such system aims at limiting deformations of the supported structures to acceptable levels.  Depending on their importance and function.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop a deformation-based method of analysis for the seismic evaluation and design of waterfront structures.  The seismic behavior and damage of typical two-dimensional gravity walls and sheet pile walls that are vulnerable to excess pore water pressure buildup and liquefaction, will be investigated.  The performance of various ground improvement techniques using as criterion the predicted permanent deformation for different levels of ground shaking intensity and will provide guidelines for remediation optimization.  An effective-stress, nonlinear finite element method, coupled with boundary elements for accurate modeling of the energy radiation through outgoing waves will be used.  The foundation, backfill and near-field soils are modeled with a rigorous, efficient critical state model, that can predict densification, pore water pressure buildup, liquefaction and cyclic mobility in sands.  The numerical model can simulate successfully the generation, redistribution and dissipation of excess pore water pressures and reveal the deformational mechanisms leading to possible failure.  \r\n\r\nThe investigation will be performed in close collaboration with researchers from Shimizu Corporation, Japan and NTUA, Greece.  \r\n\r\nThis is an award supported under the 2nd year initiative, NSF 98-36 \"US-Japan Urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation Research.\"\r\n\r\n",
