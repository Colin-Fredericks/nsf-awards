Depletion of PSF\r\nfrom splicing extracts causes a block to the second step of splicing which\r\ncan be rescued by the addition of recombinant PSF suggesting that PSF is an\r\nessential second step splicing factor.  To further characterize PSF, a\r\nseries of experiments have been performed to analyze its RNA binding\r\nspecificity and identify protein-protein interaction partners.  Preliminary\r\nresults suggest that PSF binds to a phylogenetically conserved stem\r\nstructure within U5 snRNA (stem 1b).  One of the goals of this project is\r\nto determine the affinity of PSF for RNAs encompassing one or both strands\r\nof stem 1b followed by direct analysis of PSF-U5 interaction and mapping of\r\nthe exact binding site for PSF on U5.  From mutational analyses, it appears\r\nthat the sequence of stem 1b is important not only for the formation of the\r\nstem itself, but also as a binding site for a specific protein(s).  These\r\nresults suggest that PSF binds to stem 1b of U5 and that disruption of\r\nPSF-U5 interaction results in a block to the second step of splicing.  To\r\ndirectly test this hypothesis, a series of quantitative PSF-U5 RNA binding\r\nassays will be performed using fluorescence spectroscopy followed by a\r\nfunctional in vitro assay in which U5 snRNA will be depleted from splicing\r\nextracts and then reconstituted with either wild type or mutated U5 snRNAs.\r\nThis will allow us to test the effects of specific U5 mutations on both\r\nsplicing and PSF binding.  These experiments will be complemented by in\r\nvivo analyses following the creation of cell lines in which both alleles of\r\nPSF are disrupted and replaced by an inducible PSF transgene.  Thus, all U5\r\nsnRNA mutations that disrupt PSF binding will be tested for their effects\r\non splicing both in vitro and in vivo.\r\n        Expression of most higher eukaryotic genes requires that\r\nintervening sequences (introns) be efficiently and accurately excised to\r\nallow translation of functional proteins.  Removal of introns occurs in two\r\nsteps within the spliceosome, a large complex containing multiple protein\r\nand protein-RNA complexes.  Among the best characterized of the spliceosome\r\ncomponents are the small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6,\r\nwhich play central roles both in spliceosome assembly and catalysis.  Much\r\nless is known about the protein components of the spliceosome although\r\nseveral factors have been identified, particularly those required for the\r\nfirst step of splicing.  In contrast, the identification and functional\r\ncharacterization of proteins required for the second step of splicing has\r\nlagged considerably, particularly in higher eukaryotes.  The broad goals of\r\nthis project seek to increase knowledge about the second step of splicing\r\nin humans and determine whether association of PSF with U5 snRNA is\r\nessential for this process.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
