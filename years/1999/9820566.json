 "awd_abstract_narration": "9820566\r\nGalloway, Robert L.\r\nVanderbilt University\r\n\r\nTechnology-Guided Therapy (TGT) uses traditional engineering techniques such as triangulation, \r\nimage processing, rigid rotation transformation and manipulations in Fourier space towards the task \r\nof improving how therapy such as surgery, radiation therapy or injected materials is delivered.  \r\nSpatial targeting and interactive guidance can improve both the specificity (treating only diseased \r\ntissue) and sensitivity (delivering therapy more all-diseased tissue).  This should result in more \r\ncomplete surgical resections, more exact radiation delivery and better delivery of materials to the \r\ndisease site.  The Center for TGT is a collaboration between engineers in Biomedical Engineering, \r\nComputer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering with colleagues on the medical side in \r\nthe departments of Neurosurgery, Radiation Oncology, Radiology, and Surgery.  Students working \r\nunder the auspices of the REU will work on projects from the basic science research to device \r\ndevelopment to clinical applications.  Examples of projects in the basic sciences are: development \r\nand testing of improved Magnetic Resonance Angiography, development of metrics for assessing \r\nregistration quality or grays-scale based mapping of images across a patient data set.  Examples of \r\ndevice include designing, constructing and validating the performance of a new three-dimensionally \r\ntracked instrument.  Clinical applications are, at present, intracranial, hepatobiliary and spinal with \r\nnew applications awaiting talented personnel to begin development.  We are looking for a group of \r\ntechnology-talented students with diverse skill sets.  While any one student need not have all of the following skills, we are looking for students with computer programming, mathematics, physics, \r\nphysiology, and/or engineering skills.  The students who enter the REU will work closely with the \r\nfaculty member, his or her graduate students and, if appropriate, other REU students.  The students \r\nwho are working on basic science development will not be far from the clinical applications of their \r\nwork and the students who are working on the clinical applications will ground them in solid \r\nscientific approaches.\r\n",
