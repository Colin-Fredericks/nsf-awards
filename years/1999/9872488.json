 "awd_abstract_narration": "9872488\r\nRickel\r\n\r\nA new three-year project is proposed, aimed at significantly expanding the VFTS through extensive evaluation and dissemination.  After preparing the software for large-scale dissemination, and instrumenting it to gather evaluation data, controlled testing and evaluation will begin at four different universities: USC, San Jose State University, Tennessee State University, and the University of Virginia.  Use within each university as well as the use of virtual teams that span universities will be evaluated.  Next, they intend to promote the use of the VFRS to other engineering and business schools through conference workshops, promotional materials, and publications.  They will also introduce the VFTS to Los Angeles area high school students as a way of promoting engineering careers, while encouraging other universities to take similar steps in their communities.  Because the VFRS is Webbased and network-enabled, they will not need to produce and sell CD-ROMS for its distribution, nor will we need to coordinate software purchases.  Thus, the continued dissemination and use of the VFTS beyond the three-year period of this proposal can proceed without additional funding, and with a minimum of administrative oversight.\r\n\r\nTo achieve a national impact on the education of future manufacturing engineers, a large, interdisciplinary team is crucial.  The team includes computer scientists with extensive experience developing web-based educational software, engineering professors at four different universities with extensive experience teaching factory management concepts and methods, and experts in educational theory and evaluation methods.  They have assembled an advisory board from industry to ensure that our educational goals match industry needs.  Finally, they have individuals from industry, universities, and high schools that are committed to the broad dissemination of the VFTS and its associated approach to education.\r\n",
