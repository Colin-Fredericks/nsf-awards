 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports international travel for twelve U.S. students and researchers who would not otherwise be able to attend the First AgentLink European Agent Systems Summer School being held in Utrecht, the Netherlands on July 26-30, 1999.   AgentLink, Europe's ESPRIT-funded Network of Excellence for agent-based computing, organizes the school (http://www.agentlink.org). It is a world-class event that will bring together internationally recognized researchers in the area of agents and multi-agent systems to present introductory and advanced courses in the theoretical and practical aspects of agent-based computing. The objective of this award is to encourage and enable two groups of U.S. researchers to attend this event: 1) graduate students of outstanding merit who are interested in research in agent systems but have no current funding to enable such participation; and 2) researchers in other related fields who need encouragement to bring their particular expertise to this field and for them to learn about agent-based computing so that they may apply it to their own fields. This travel grant will cover their travel, hotel, registration fees, and some subsistence. The Europeans are giving similar support to their graduate students, i.e., those at European universities who are registered AgentLink members. This travel grant allows a strong and diverse group of US researchers to attend EASS '99 rather than just a small group of elite researchers. Further, because the summer school is in Europe, it provides a unique opportunity for American researchers to have direct contact with their European colleagues. \r\n\r\n",
