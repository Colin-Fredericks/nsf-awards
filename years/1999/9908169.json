 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to investigate the surface conditioning of Micro-electromechanical systems to produce an anti-stiction coating necessary for both the manufacturing of such devices (release) and for the performance of these systems.  This research is directed towards a simpler and lower cost method of reducing stiction (atom to atom adherence) in the self-assembled mono-layer (SAMS) processing.  This requires a fundamental study of the surface complexity, the chemistry during surface oxidation, etching, and the SAM formation steps of the processing sequence.  While this is wet-chemistry based, the surface morphologies and subsequent performance are dictated by all steps of the process.  The consideration for waste-reduction schemes will investigate means of substitution for toxic solvent chemistries and reduction of water and solvent usage.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to make this process manufacturable, by determining critical process variables and control limits and by adding sensors for tight process control.  Strategies aiming to achieve process simplification, automation, and chemical waste reduction will also be a part of this project.\r\n",
