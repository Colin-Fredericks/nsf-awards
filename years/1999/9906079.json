 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Daughters with Disabilities\" was created to address concerns about girls with disabilities in elementary public schools who are widely underserved in inclusionary settings and under-educated in the areas of science, math, engineering, and technology (SMET).  A critical outcome of such poor SMET educational experiences is the negative way that students with disabilities perceive science and math--either they have no further interest in these areas or they are denied the opportunities to pursue further education because of their limited or non-existent knowledge base.  To meet the complex needs of such a significant problem, the proposed project builds upon two previously successful, National Science Foundation-funded, multi-generational projects.  It refines the positive results of both Sisters in Science located at Temple University) and Project DO-IT located at the University of Washington) to address the needs of females with disabilities who are currently educated in the elementary grades of inner-city schools.  Daughters with Disabilities will provide a three-year intervention to a total of 120 girls with disabilities, their families, 24 teachers, and 6 aides from different schools within the North Philadelphia area.  Through the professional development of over 100 special education teachers both pre-service and already teaching in Philadelphia), the utilization of a corps of mentors, and the creation of a family education program, the project should have a direct impact on students, teachers, parents, and the SMET curriculum.  Specific goals include: (a) To enhance the existing SMET curriculum through specific inclusionary activities and learning methods shown to increase girls' with disabilities interest and achievement in SMET;  b)To increase interest and achievement in SMET among elementary school girls with disabilities; (c) To involve Temple University undergraduate special education students in practical hands-on experiences at selected Philadelphia elementary schools in inclusive settings; (d) To involve elementary regular and special education teachers in practical hands-on in their home schools; and (e) To increase the knowledge and participation of families and caregivers of daughters with disabilities in terms of their science, math, and technological education.  The project will achieve the goals and objectives through six interrelated components:  Teacher Training; Classroom Activities;  Saturday Program; Summer Program; Family Consultation; and Mentors.  \r\n     The instructional activities inherent in the Daughters with Disabilities model should build critical links for girls with disabilities throughout the school, home and community to effect a permanent SMET climate change for this growing and often over-looked population.  \r\n",
