 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research program is to develop the capability to generate realistic inversion-based models of complex basin geology and earthquake sources \"by computer simulation\" and to use this capability to model and forecast strong ground motions during earthquakes in Los Angeles Basin and the San Francisco Bay Area.  This problem is of great importance to earthquake hazard mitigation, since assessing the ground motion experiences by structures during their lifetimes is an essential first step in designing earthquake-resistant facilities, and retrofitting existing structures: ground motion modeling and forecasting are a necessary precursor to the design process.  This project involves collaboration between researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, University of California at Berkeley and San Diego State University.  The research team, centered at Carnegie Mellon University, consists of earthquake engineers, seismologists, geologists, computational mechanists, computer scientists, and computer graphics and visualization specialist.\r\n\r\nComputer modeling and forecasting earthquake ground motions in large basins, is a challenging and complex task, with the complexity arising from several sources: multiple spatial scales characterize the basin response (the shortest wavelengths are measured in tens of meters, the longest in kilometers, and basin dimensions are on the order of tens of kilometers); temporal scales vary from the hundredths of a second necessary to resolve the highest frequencies of the earthquake source up to a couple of minutes of shaking within the basin; many basins have highly irregular geometry; the soils; material properties are highly heterogeneous; and geology and source parameters are only indirectly observable, and thus introduce uncertainty into the modeling process.  \r\n\r\nCurrent earthquake simulations provide much useful information, but are not always capable of adequately reproducing observed seismograms.  The likely reason is that these models use a number of restrictive assumptions to reduce the computational requirements.  Motivated by the need for greater fidelity in earthquake ground motion modeling the research team is developing enhance models by incorporating the following: (1) The ability to represent physical domains an order of magnitude larger than current models; (2) The ability to model frequencies higher than currently possible; (3) Improved earthquake source models derived from available observation by solving 3D inverse problems; (4) improved basin material models based on the inversion of observations of ground motion within the basin; and (5) The ability to resolve boundary surfaces and sharp interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe drive toward greater fidelity in earthquake modeling introduces computational challenges in all states of the simulation process: from preprocessing, to solving, to postprocessing.  This is addressed through a concerted, unified effort in parallel 3D mesh generation, parallel 3D seismic inversion, and large-scale distributed visualization.  It is expected that this will result in important advances in physical modeling and algorithm and software tool development for multi-teraflops computers, while gaining physical insight into earthquake ground motion.  Because of the critical role that ground motion plays in infrastructure design, the accelerated availability of suitable simulation methodologies will have a direct impact on public safety and welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
