 "awd_abstract_narration": "9970440\r\n\r\nThis proposal is concerned with diophantine equations in many variables, in the context of the theory and application of the Hardy-Littlewood (circle) method.  The proposer intends to pursue a number of investigations whose goal is an improved understanding of the existence and density of integer solutions of systems of homogeneous equations, and associated estimates for exponential sums of use in the circle method.  Two themes play a large role in proposed investigations.  In one direction, methods familiar from the application of the Hardy-Littlewood method to additive diophantine problems will be extended to handle diophantine equations more closely approximating general homogeneous equations.  Here the proposers methods for handling exponential sums over binary forms, and over smooth numbers, are significant. In a second direction, the more elementary diagonalisation methods, originating in work of Brauer and Birch, will be extended so as to obtain more refined conclusions concerning the density of rational solutions to systems of diophantine equations.\r\n\r\nNumber Theory studies the properties of integers (``whole numbers''). Since Antiquity, the study of diophantine equations (equations to be solved in integers) has formed a core component of Number Theory, and has recently influenced the development of codes and cryptosystems (applied, for example, in data storage systems such as compact disks, communications systems and banking security).\r\n",
