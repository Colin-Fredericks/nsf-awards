 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award provides funding for the development of a novel design for adaptable intelligent appliance controllers.  The controllers will be used in large white appliances which include refrigerators, washers, dryers, ovens, and dishwashers.  This project will address two objectives in the development of intelligent appliances for the household.  The first objective is the development of a generic smart control module, which can be used in a variety of appliances.  This module will be able to adapt to its environment through the use of intelligent systems including fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks.  The second objective is the creation of the development environment for the customization of the generic appliance controllers, which enables designing for reuse, reducing development time, and designing for an international marketplace.  The project tasks will include standardization of the hardware components and designs, the development of a generic embedded operating system and the development of re-usable embedded control objects and software for the smart module.  Once the standards are established and the base smart control module designed, the development environment will be designed.  The development environment will give the user the ability to design the logic, develop the host software, develop the network communications, and establish the data acquisition protocol.  The development environment will also allow for integration testing and developing security systems.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will be a novel design environment for adaptable intelligent appliance controllers in which the user will be able to personalize the generic smart control module to perform according to his or her needs. This design environment will be the key to a product development system that will reduce the time-to-market, eliminate excess requirement cycles, lower system development cost, and improve overall product quality.",
