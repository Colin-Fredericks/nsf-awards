 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971953\r\nWilkerson\r\n     Wilkerson will continue his work with Dwyer on the extended Steenrod\r\nproblem of understanding spaces with properties at a prime similar to\r\nthose of the classifying spaces of connected compact Lie groups.  He will\r\nalso work with Jeff Smith on homotopy automorphism groups of finite\r\nnilpotent complexes and actions of finite groups on such complexes.  In\r\naddition, he will work with Jim Turner and Avramov on analogues of the\r\nSerre theorem that establishes that non-trivial simply connected finite\r\ncomplexes have nontrivial homotopy in an infinite number of dimensions.\r\nMcClure will work with Jeff Smith on higher centers of associative ring\r\nspectra.  He will also investigate a large class of spectral sequences\r\nthat should admit chain-complex models that facilitate calculation.  A\r\nstep in this project that should be interesting in its own right is to\r\nshow that certain homotopy categories of module spectra can be modeled by\r\nchain complexes.  Shipley will develop a new model for equivariant stable\r\nhomotopy theory; this will provide algebraic models for rational\r\nequivariant stable homotopy theory over compact Lie groups.  She will\r\nalso study (with Dwyer) a cobar spectral sequence and its convergence\r\nproperties.  With Rezk and Schwede she will study a way to replace\r\narbitrary model categories by simplicial model categories.  Smith will\r\ncontinue his work on using the theory of model categories as a tool\r\nfor the study of ring spectra and of commutative ring spectra.  In\r\nparticular, he will study the homotopy theory of ring spectra over a\r\nfixed ring R, the homotopy theory of coalgebras of R-bimodules, and the\r\nbar construction.  He will improve his theory of combinatorial model\r\ncategories to make it a more effective tool.  In joint work with Adem he\r\nwill study the homotopy theory of group actions on homotopy products of\r\nspheres.\r\n     As can be seen from this summary, this project will involve research\r\nin many different directions within homotopy theory.  Several of the\r\nproblems to be investigated have been important for a long time (for\r\nexample, the Steenrod problem and the joint work of Smith and Adem go\r\nback to the 1960's), while others involve very recent developments\r\n(especially the theory of strictly associative and commutative ring\r\nspectra; Smith and Shipley were pioneers in this area, and McClure's\r\nwork makes heavy use of it).  The joint work of McClure and Smith has\r\napplications to mathematical physics, since it is closely related to\r\nrecent work of Kontsevich and Tamarkin on deformation quantization.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
