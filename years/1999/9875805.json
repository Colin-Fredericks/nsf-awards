 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for CCR-9875805\r\n\r\nWireless communication systems, particularly code-division\r\nmultiple access (CDMA) systems, are vital building blocks of the rapidly\r\nevolving global information infrastructure. Digital signal processing (DSP)\r\nis playing a central role in wireless communications due to the increasingly\r\nsophisticated processing required in the physical network layer.  The major\r\nDSP challenges in CDMA system design stem from three key factors that\r\ndominate the processing in the physical layer: (1) channel propagation\r\ndynamics; (2) multiaccess interference; and, (3) the inherent complexity of\r\nthe DSP algorithms. The proposed research has two primary goals for meeting\r\nthe physical layer CDMA challenges:\r\n\r\n*       Development of DSP tools and theory to launch an integrated attack\r\non time-varying multipath dispersion, time-varying multipath fading, and\r\nmultiaccess interference.\r\n*       Development of design strategies for practical high-performance\r\nsystems that optimize the complexity versus performance tradeoffs inherent\r\nin the DSP techniques.\r\n\r\nA new unified framework based on DSP in canonical multipath-Doppler\r\ncoordinates will be developed to meet these goals. The canonical coordinates\r\nare defined by a fixed basis that is derived from a fundamental\r\ncharacterization of channel propagation dynamics in terms of certain discrete\r\nmultipath delays and Doppler shifts of the signaling waveform. The canonical\r\ncoordinates naturally connect the key physical layer facets and thus\r\nfacilitate a unified DSP development. First, all processing relating to\r\npropagation effects can be directly performed in the coordinates. Second,\r\nthe same coordinates provide a canonical subspace-based representation\r\nof the desired signal and multiaccess interference. Finally, the simple \r\ncomputation and subspace structure of the coordinates affords a direct handle \r\non complexity. At the heart of the research is a particularly promising\r\ninnovation: whereas existing interference suppression techniques treat\r\npropagation effects as a nuisance, canonical coordinates exploit the subspace\r\nstructure induced by channel effects for enhanced interference suppression.\r\n\r\nThe educational objectives of the program include integrated curriculum\r\ndevelopment in DSP and communications, a thematic approach to teaching to\r\nfacilitate conceptual thinking, and leveraging of technology to extend the\r\nboundaries of traditional instruction and learning.\r\n   \r\n",
