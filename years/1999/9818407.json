 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of the paleoclimatic history of continental areas are important to our understanding of how terrestrial ecosystems and hydrologic systems respond to changes in the earth's radiation budget.  However, owing to the variable nature of continental processes, few archives of these processes are available, especially where the nature of these processes can be retraced at very high-resolution time scales which can also be precisely dated.  The speleothem deposits of limestone caves represent one such potential repository.  The purpose of this research is to investigate the interannual to sub-decadal paleoclimatic signals recorded by stalagmites in terms of both spatial and temporal variability.  The investigation covers the eastern half of China over the past 2000 years.  That such highly resolved time-series paleoclimate variability can be effectively read has been encouraged by recent exploratory studies which show that a combination of isotopic (18O and 13C) and chemical (Mg/Sr/Ca) analyses can help decipher changes in temperature, precipitation and vegetation in the past.  Furthermore, these studies reveal a climatic cyclicity that may tie to past variations of the summer monsoon strength.  This research will contribute to our understanding of not only the climate history of eastern Asia, but also the factors influencing the monsoon fluctuations that are rooted in the global climate variability.",
