 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Olga Soffer, Mr. Valeriy Suntsov will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze lithic materials from eight archaeological sites located on the East European Plain in the Ukraine and Russia. All relate to the Epigravettian culture and are dated between 20,000 and 12,000 years ago. These sites are best known because of their impressive hut structures, the frames and bases of which were constructed from mammoth tusks and bones. Large storage pits associated with these dwellings likely served to store meat which, because of cold winter conditions, could be preserved for months. The abundance of worked shell and bone artifacts, together with the storage pits and carefully constructed dwellings suggests that the inhabitants were sedentary for major portions of the year and not highly nomadic.  The sites are unusual not only for the degree of sedentization they reveal but also for the richness of their material remains which allow a significant degree of behavioral reconstruction. Within this controlled context Mr. Suntsov will examine the systems for lithic procurement, manufacture, utilization and discard. In this pre metal period, humans produced knives, scrapers, awls and other tools from stone and both the tools themselves and the byproducts of their manufacture have been recovered by the thousands from each site. The sources of the raw material are also well known.\r\n\r\nBecause lithics are well represented in most Paleolithic sites and often constitute the only class of material remain, archaeologists devote considerable time to their study. They have developed analytic systems which make many reasonable, but usually proven, assumptions. For example it is believed that when people live near abundant sources of high quality flint they will make a wide range of tools designed for specific purposes. When flint sources are more distant and of poorer quality, fewer all-purpose tools will be produced. Likewise assumptions have been made about the degree of settlement mobility and the nature of stone tool kits. At the Epigravettian sites under consideration, where both raw material sources and degree of mobility are known, it is possible to test these assumptions and approaches through the analysis of the lithics recovered. Because the sites are located at varying distances from raw material sources and because the flint varies in quality, one can use extant models to predict the nature of variation between sites. Mr. Suntsov has made an explicit set of predictions and through analysis of the lithics determine whether they are correct.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons. It will help to test and refine a series of analytic techniques which are potentially applicable in a wide variety of archaeological situations. It will also assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
