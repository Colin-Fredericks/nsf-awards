 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was submitted to the NSF-wide Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The PI has a background in wetland ecology and is interested the role that wetlands play as a buffer between upland land-use activities and downstream water quality in coastal estuaries and bays.  She would like to expand her research via the use of landscape-scale dynamic spatial models. The proposal requests support for the PI to complete three tasks, which are 1) training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) which is essential for large-scale modeling/data acquisition, 2) initiation of a pilot project in Indian River Lagoon for assessing the feasibility of measuring changes in water quality and subsequent structure of submerged aquatic vegetation associated with the narrowing and potential loss of the wetland fringe surrounding coastal bays, and  3) to purchase and become familiar with the Stella modeling program.",
