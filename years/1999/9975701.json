The instruments (Reactive Nitrogen Source, Cryogenic Pump, and MBE-STM Transfer System) will be combined with the existing ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope and Varian Gen II molecular beam epitaxial growth chamber, in order to facilitate device-quality growth and in-situ characterization of mixed anion nitride-arsenide alloys.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this equipment will provide state-of-the-art instrumentation for approximately 9 graduate and undergraduate students, at the University of Michigan and at Eastern Michigan University, a nearby non-Ph.D. granting University. Furthermore, the system will impact additional 30-40 undergraduate students by enabling growth of technologically important nitride-based materials for use in undergraduate laboratory modules in electronic and photonic materials.  The system will also provide opportunities for growth and characterization demonstrations in undergraduate and graduate courses. \r\n%%%\r\nThis award is expected to significantly enhance research and educational activities of faculty and students at several institutions.\r\n",
