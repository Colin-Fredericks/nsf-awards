 "awd_abstract_narration": "9876285\r\nJudy \r\nThis applicant proposes a career development program with the following objectives: (I) to develop a strong laboratory-based microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) educational program, that will have a multidisciplinary impact on the training of graduate and undergraduate students of all backgrounds; (2) to develop a strong research program that focuses on the methods and applications of compatibly integrating ferromagnetic materials, MEMS, and ICs.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research program are: (I.) to develop methods of compatibly integrating ferromagnetic materials with MEMS and ICs; (2) to combine ferromagnetic materials with micromachined flexures and capacitive position detecting ICs (very similar to those used in micromachined inertial sensors), to produce extremely sensitive micropower magnetometers (suitable for long-term wireless sensor networks); (3) to develop methods of integrating dense high aspect ratio windings, that are imbedded into the substrate and can enable high-force magnetic microactuators that consume less power and die area.\r\n\r\nEducational Program:\r\nThe educational part this career plan consists of several major efforts, including the development of a summer outreach program and four new courses, which will compliment the existing graduate-level MEMS courses available at UCLA. (1) Introduction to Micromachining and MEMS, an undergraduate course on MEMS that emphasizes micromachining and has an accompanying weekly 4-hour laboratory. This course will serve as an entry course for students of all backgrounds who have an interest in MEMS. (2) Advanced Micromachining and MEMS Laboratory; a graduate-level laboratory on micromachining that wiJJ give students valnabie hands-on experience with the same equipment they will use in their research on MEMS. (3) Introduction to Magnetic Materials, a course taught at the senior/graduate level that will serve the entire campus, since there is presently no course that covers the engineering properties of magnetic materials in depth. (4) MEMS Seminar Series, a weekly seminar that provides a forum for featuring speakers varying from students on campus to visiting MEMS researchers from overseas. (5) MEMS Summer Research and Outreach Program, specifically tailored for UCLA undergraduates and advanced high school seniors from the surrounding Los Angeles area.\r\n***\r\n",
