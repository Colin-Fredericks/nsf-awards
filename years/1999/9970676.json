 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nProfessor Fried will continue research on modular towers.  A Modular tower is a sequence of moduli spaces canonically attached to a set of data coming from a finite group.  Modular towers are designed to allow analogies of the ideas of modular curves in many applications not previously associated with such techniques.  This project will concentrate on modular curve towers.  Among the goals of the project is to establish that high levels of a modular tower of curves will have no rational points, an important issue for many of the applications of the towers. Also to make the techniques of modular towers more easily applicable in new situations, Professor Fried will try to establish criteria which allow arbitrary towers of non-congruence curves to be given the structure of a modular tower. \r\n\r\nIn this project, Professor Fried will continue his work on issues related to the Inverse Galois Problem.  This is a long-standing unanswered question with its origins in the 19 century.  Over a hundred years ago mathematicians found that one could classify properties of the solutions to an equation by studying the symmetries of those solutions.  The solutions themselves and the symmetries of the solutions were connected in a direct but very surprising way.  Easy properties of symmetries were often connected to difficult properties of the solutions and vice versa. This allows the easy things to be transferred back and forth to the hard things through the connection.  The result is very powerful method for discovery.  In earlier work, Professor Fried introduced a new object into this connection called modular towers, and he hopes to use this object strengthen our understanding of the connection in the direction from the symmetries to the solutions.",
