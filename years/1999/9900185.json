 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tStructural or continuous fiber composites possess the unique qualities of high strength, high stiffness, and lightweight, as well as tailorable thermal and electrical properties. Despite demonstrated success in low volume aerospace and defense applications, structural composites remain at the periphery of high volume industries such as construction, automotive, and consumer goods because of long cycle time. Stamping, the target manufacturing process of this project, provides a means of making composite sheet products at rates ten to a hundred times faster than any existing continuous fiber processes. However, to make composites stamping a viable process, one must understand how the fibers deform, what causes defects such as wrinkling and tearing, and how process parameters such as temperature, stamping rate, and boundary constraints all affect the material response. These challenging issues will be addressed by collaborative research between two universities and Ford. The investigators will apply their collective knowledge in the areas of sheet metal stamping, textile mechanics, and composites forming. \r\n\tThe primary goal of this research project is the development of a composite stamping model to assist designers with optimizing material selection and tool/blank/process design for manufacturing. This knowledge will create opportunities for stamped structural composites to be utilized in high volume applications. The knowledge gained in this research will have not only a substantial impact upon industry but will be widely disseminated to industry practitioners and graduate and undergraduate students.\t\r\n",
