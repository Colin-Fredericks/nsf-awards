Five universities and community colleges in Washington will lead efforts of educators and industry throughout the Pacific Northwest to establish effective processes for improving engineering design education.  Through regional workshops, they will define educational objectives and achievement standards suitable for the region, refine and facilitate implementation of assessments for engineering design, and prepare others to implement effective design education practices.  Resulting improvements to teaching of design will increase student, learning of competencies important to the region and will increase retention and success of qualified students, especially women and minorities.\r\n\r\nThis project includes research to evaluate and improve design assessments and training to support institutionalization of effective practices and materials.  Proposed design assessments will be tested in two ways: (a) through comparative analysis of design team actions, their design products, and their design perceptions and (b) through comparisons of assessment results to responses on alumni/employer surveys.  A web-based survey will be developed to obtain alumni/employer feedback for assessment of program achievement on a regional scale.  Faculty trainers will be prepared and assisted to lead local workshops patterned after regional workshops.  These workshops will empower faculty to implement and continue improvement of design education materials, methods, and assessments for their local needs.\r\n\r\nThe regional design education model will be synthesized from resources developed in Washington through the NSF-funded Transferable Integrated Design Engineering Education (TTDEE) project:\r\n- Proven TTIDEE collaborative learning models for teaching and learning of engineering design\r\n- Definitions of learning outcomes for engineering design at mid-program and end-of-program points\r\n- Pilot-tested and proposed instruments for mid-program and end-of-program design assessments\r\n- Workshop facilitation expertise for team-based engineering design education and assessment\r\n- Extensive collaborative efforts across the state on engineering design education\r\n- Affiliations with institutions and organizations across the region and nation for extended impact\r\n",
