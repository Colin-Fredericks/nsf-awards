Osgood, the Principal Investigator, and others has shown that these two fields are in fact connected by a formal analogy.  This observation has led to new conjectures, shorter proofs of existing theorems, and proofs of new theorems.  This project will extend the analogy, working primarily but not entirely in the field of diophantine approximation.\r\n\r\nNumber theory is the study of the properties of whole numbers and ]rational numbers.  A large part of this is devoted to studying whole-number and rational-number solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  One particular approach to this study has been to look at inequalities satisfied by such solutions.  This approach, called diophantine approximation, is often useful for proving that there are few integer or rational solutions to a given set of polynomial equations. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
