 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS), a National Systematics Research Resource Center, maintains some of the largest and most historically significant North American collections of the aquatic insect orders Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), and Trichoptera (caddisflies), collectively referred to as EPT.  These groups are recognized as containing some of the most sensitive biotic indicators of stream health.\r\n\r\nConsiderable holdings of EPT type specimens, and other historically important material, results in a heavy demand for loans of specimens and requests for information on species distributions.  Recognizing that the INHS is an important repository for EPT specimens and information needed by systematists, biogeographers, ecologists, and conservationists, the INHS initiated efforts to computerize the specimen label data and serve it to the Internet.  Stonefly specimen label data (18,486) are now available on the Internet.  Computerization of the mayfly and caddisfly holdings is underway.  Completion of these two databases would result in the most comprehensive specimen level EPT database available anywhere.  This project will support the computerization of the large and historically significant EPT collection housed at the INHS.  Specific goals of this project are to: (1) enter the collection label data for the remaining mayflies and caddisflies; (2) georeference locality data for all EPT records at the INHS; (3) serve the tabular database to the Internet; (4) serve the georeference locality data to the Internet as high quality maps of species distributions at appropriate scales; (5) restructure existing flat file format to an expanded relational one; (6) update nomenclature; and (7) obtain the computer equipment and software necessary to construct the databases and serve them to the Internet as envisioned in this proposal.  \r\n\r\nCompilation of EPT specimen records into a coordinated, GIS-linked, Internet-accessible database will provide  a valuable tool for ecological, biogeographical, and systematic research on EPT species and will also provide a unique opportunity to assess historical changes in species richness and stream health.  Using an advanced search engine, researchers world wide will be able to search the database using combinations of taxonomic and geographic descriptors, generate species lists for localities or drainages, access distribution maps, and match immature and adult specimens based on their presence or absence at specific localities.\r\npletion of these two databases would result in the most comprehensive specimen level EPT database available anywhere.
