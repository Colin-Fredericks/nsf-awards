 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award of the Special Projects Office of the Chemistry Division supports the research of Professor Virginia Cornish at Columbia University.  The theme of the research is the development of dexamethasone-tetracycline as an H1-H2 pair of chemical handles capable of inducing protein dimerization in vivo with high efficiency.  \r\n\r\nThe need for efficient catalysts is fundamental to chemistry.  Biological catalysts drive cellular processes, and the chemical industry relies on catalysts for the synthesis of compounds ranging from pharmaceuticals to materials.  In this project proteins, which are remarkable catalysts for a broad array of reactions, will be designed using combinatorial techniques, which allow large pools of protein variants to be generated and screened simultaneously.  A selection strategy that is both a direct screen for catalysis and can be applied to many different reaction types, will be developed.\r\n",
