 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Elizabeth Miksa will develop a method for determining manufacturing location of prehistoric pottery produced in the San Pedro River Valley of Arizona and Sonora. This area falls within the boundaries of the Hohokam regional system which extended over an area of more than 100,000 square km. Hohokam peoples achieved a high level of social integration in an arid part of the US Southwest in an environment which was not only dry but also experienced large and unpredictable shifts in rainfall from year to year and season to season. Through the maintenance of canals and irrigation agriculture it was possible to integrate large numbers of people into a single social system and sustain a settled village way of life. Although it is clear, through the analysis of several distinctive pottery types, that individual villages shared a common ideology and engaged in trade and other interactions, the details of these networks and how they changed over time are poorly understood. The picture is complicated by the fact that complex pottery styles were imitated and the existence of a shared motif, for example, does not mean that all vessels exhibiting it were produced at single site. Through petrographic and chemical analysis of ceramics, Dr. Miksa will gain new insight into trade and interaction networks. She will develop a sand petrofacies method for sourcing ceramics. Based on bedrock geology, it is highly likely that sand varies in composition across the San Pedro River drainage. Because aboriginal potters in the Southwest added sand to pot making clay for temper and because sand was usually collected from local sources, by analyzing the sand inclusions in prehistoric pottery it should be possible to determine their point of origin. Dr. Miksa will characterize sand from a number of locales within the river valley and then apply the results to a prehistoric sample. She will use trace element analysis (obtained through INAA) to provide supplementary information in situations where pastes are different but tempers the same.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons. It will provide a model for sand temper analysis which, hopefully, can be applied in many regions of the world. The work will also shed light on the social and political organization within the prehistoric US Southwest.\r\n",
