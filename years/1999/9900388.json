The Institute consists of a series of three-day workshops offering intense training in the methods for performing statistical analyses of genetic data. It is aimed primarily at geneticists wishing to learn statistical methodology, but also attracts some statisticians wishing to learn about genetic applications. The courses are taught by faculty drawn from NC State University and other institutions, and attracts about 200 participants worldwide. These funds will be used for student scholarships.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid progress in genomic science, due in large part to the Human Genome Project, there is accumulating a vast amount of genetic data. These data will allow for a new understanding of the processes of evolution, of the means for identifying genes that affect human diseases and traits of economic importance in domesticated species, and of the means for identifying individuals in forensic, endangered species and varietal protection contexts. These data all require appropriate statistical analyses in order to extract the most information, but training in statistical genetics does not form part of most university curricula. The Summer Institute brings together world authorities who can both cover the basic elements of their specialties and can describe new methods.\r\n",
