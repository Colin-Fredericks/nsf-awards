The behavior systems approach attempts to resolve the split between ethologists and psychologists by assuming that the same substrate of sequential search states and   perceptual-motor organization underlies the behavior of animals whether they are free-ranging or constrained.  This research specifically tests how a sequence of search modes is revealed by and contributes to traditional laboratory phenomena in Pavlovian Conditioning, including the control of excitatory states by temporal duration and simple conditioned-stimuli, intertrial clocks, serial conditioned stimuli, higher-order conditioning, and  backward conditioning.\r\n\tThe results of this research should provide a specific but generalizable framework for integrating the field observations of natural scientists with the extensive laboratory research on learning in animals.  By embedding foraging behavior in the sensory, motor, and motivational organization of a behavior system, the present approach provides a specific model that can predict behavior in the laboratory as well as in field and applied settings.  A behavior systems framework should provide a basis for generating similar models for other species, and for defining more clearly the effects of neurophysiological and drug-related manipulations.\r\n",
