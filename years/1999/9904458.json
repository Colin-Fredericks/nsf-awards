 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of the project is the development of the necessary tools and know-how to design and implementable signal detector for magnetic recording systems operating in signal-dependent correlated noise environments, i.e., media noise dominated environments.  According to recent studies, it is anticipated that the current magnetic recording technology will hit the superparamagnetic limit in approximately five years.  The superparamagnetic limit occurs when the magnetic media particles become so small that thermal energy at room temperature is enough to destabilize the particle by randomly switching its magnetization orientation.  To push back the approaching superparamagnetic limit, signal processing circuits will have to cope with a radically changed signal/noise environment: the signal-to-noise ratio will drop, the magnetic media noise will dominate over the electronics white noise, and the overall noise will become extremely correlated and signal-dependent due to the intersymbol interactions in the magnetic media and due to the coloring introduced by the read head.  This project will develop a fundamental understanding of nonstationary stochastic modeling and use it to develop a magnetic recording detector ideally tuned to correlated nonstationary media noise.\r\n\r\nThe project will be conducted through collaboration between Harvard University and IBM Almaden Research Center.  IBM, a recognized global magnetic recording technology leader, is in a unique position to provide the cutting edge experimental support required establishing the link between the theoretical and experimental parts of the project.  The project combines three major efforts. (i) A understanding of signal-dependent noise modeling issues will be developed.  This is an extension of widely used autoregressive modeling methods in stationary processes to nonstationary processes.  Particular attention will be given to objective model-size estimation through the adaptation of Akaike's information theoretic criterion or Rissanen's minimum description length principle.  (ii) The receiver will be designed through a complexity-constrained optimization procedure.  Since both the intersymbol interference length and the noise memory length contribute equally to the receiver complexity, the constrained-complexity detector will minimize the sum of the two lengths under a performance specification.  (iii) The final goal is the implementation of the detector in VLSI technology.  Towards this goal, a software detector and then a hardware detector will be developed.  Both detectors will be tested in real channel environments at IBM Almaden Research Center.\r\n",
