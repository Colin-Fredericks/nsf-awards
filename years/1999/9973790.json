 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will consist of two parts, finishing the principal investigator's book, The Cuban Republic: Themes and Interpretations (1898-1960) and teaching a graduate-level course on the Caribbean Basin.  In The Cuban Republic, the investigator will analyze twentieth-century Cuba before the revolution of 1959.  The book will address three major questions.  The first deals with the upper classes and their relations within different sectors (sugar and nonsugar, especially), with the middle and working classes, with the political system, and with the United States (government and private sector).  The second will develop political themes, i.e., the formation of a political class, issues of conflict and consensus, political parties and institutions, the interaction of democracy and dictatorship.  The third will address the ways in which Cubans themselves influenced and shaped relations with the United States.  This book will draw a portrait of the old Cuba on its own terms, i.e., for what it was and was becoming, but did not.  With a prospective transition on the island, the new Cuba that is yet to be will need to take a new look into the prerevolutionary past.  The Cuban Republic will offer historical interpretations that look forward to a democratic and prosperous Cuba.  As a second component of the award, the investigator will teach a graduate-level seminar, \"State and Nation in the Caribbean Basin (19th and 20th Centuries).\"  Her primary focus will be to understand the region's small nations within their own histories and cultures, not just as mere reactive actors to the actions and policies of the United States.  She will especially highlight the different experiences of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua.  The course will conclude with a critical overview of the challenges of democracy, social justice, and sovereignty at the turn of the new century.  This POWRE award will provide the Principal Investigator with opportunities for career advancement and professional growth.  The Cuban Republic will be a sequel to her well-established The Cuban Revolution: Origins, Course, and Legacy (Oxford University Press, 1993, 1999).  The Caribbean course will allow her to expand into other countries in the region and develop a comparative research agenda.  Her residence at Florida International University will connect her with faculty, students, and a community keenly interested in her areas of study.",
