 "awd_abstract_narration": "9902327\r\n\r\nThe enzyme phosphoglucomutase (PGM) plays a role in glycogen metabolism at a key point in the central metabolic pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. Significant protein variation has already been found at the PGM locus, but to what extent this variation plays a role in natural populations is unknown. The goal of this project is to combine a study of DNA sequence variation at the PGM locus in Drosophila melanogaster with a study of the functional differences of PGM variation and their effect on flux in the metabolic pathway. This study will screen for known protein variation in natural populations to test for geographic differentiation. Differences in PGM enzymatic activity and stability and their effect on glycogen content will also be determined.\r\n\r\nBecause certain points may have more influence on controlling metabolic flux in the pathway, it is believed that protein variation at these points represents potential variation upon which selection can operate to regulate flux in the pathway. If enzyme activity or stability variation for PGM does result in measurable differences in glycogen levels, this suggests that protein variation at the PGM locus represents variation that is influential in controlling flux in the pathway.  If protein variation differs significantly across populations, this suggests that patterns of variation at this locus in natural populations are influenced by natural selection. \r\n",
