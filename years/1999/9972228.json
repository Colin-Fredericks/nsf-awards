They use the geodesic snake\r\napproach in which they set up a Partial Differential Equation\r\n(PDE) that drives the evolution of a manifold in some potential\r\nfield created by the data points, such that the solution of the\r\nPDE converges to a manifold that is very close to the data points\r\n(ideally contains them).  The \"shape\" of this manifold (including\r\nits co-dimension) characterizes the set of points.  They\r\ninvestigate computationally efficient implementations for\r\nevolving manifolds of arbitrary co-dimension by level sets\r\nmethods, because of their robustness and flexibility.  These\r\nimplementations are being used to study the Euclidean and affine\r\nmean-curvature motion of curves in three-dimensional spaces.  Two\r\napplications are being pursued by the investigators.  The first\r\napplication is the detection of blood vessels in Magnetic\r\nResonance Angiography (MRA) images.  In MRA images, blood vessels\r\nappear as bright and noisy curve-like patterns, possibly with\r\ngaps.  It is important to detect those patterns independently of\r\nthe noise and to bridge the gaps.  The detection of blood vessels\r\ncan be considered, as a first approximation, as an instance of\r\nthe three-dimensional case, co-dimension two.  The second\r\napplication is the clustering of feature points in higher\r\ndimensional spaces with an eye on two specific problems, the\r\ndescription of the \"shape\" of a cluster and the design of\r\nautomated content-based image retrieval systems.  A given pattern,\r\ne.g. an image, can be represented by a vector of features in some\r\nn-dimensional space.  Patterns in the same class usually fall into\r\nclusters that may have some very tricky \"shapes\".  The\r\ninvestigators and their collegues believe that their methods can\r\nprovide ways of automatically obtaining shape descriptions from\r\nsets of sample feature vectors thereby facilitating the design of\r\nrecognition algorithms and improving their performances.  A target\r\napplication is the design of automated content-based image\r\nretrieval systems.\r\n     The investigators and their colleagues study the problem of\r\nautomatically fitting a set of points in a possibly\r\nhigh-dimensional space to a set of smooth manifolds.  This is\r\nimportant because in many practical applications data can be\r\nrepresented as points in high-dimensional spaces.  They are\r\ncurrently pursuing two applications of these techniques.  The\r\nfirst one is the detection of blood vessels in Magnetic Resonance\r\nAngiography (MRA) images.  In MRA images, blood vessels appear as\r\nbright and noisy curve-like patterns, possibly with gaps.  It is\r\nimportant to detect those patterns independently of the noise and\r\nto bridge the gaps.  The results of this detection can be used in\r\nthe diagnosis of diseases and in planning surgery.  The second\r\napplication is the description of the \"shape\" of a cluster of\r\npoints in a high-dimensional space.  The investigators and their\r\ncolleagues are investigating means of automatically obtaining\r\nsuch descriptions from a set of samples.  They believe that this\r\nwill facilitate the design of recognition algorithms and increase\r\ntheir performances.  A target application that is particularly\r\nrelevant to the average citizen is the design of automated\r\ncontent-based image retrieval systems.  In such systems each image\r\ncan be represented by a point in some high-dimensional (10 to 20)\r\nfeature space, and images in the same class, e.g. images of cars,\r\ncluster on some manifold, e.g a \"car-manifold\".  The description\r\nof the shape of this manifold (which is simpler than the real\r\nshapes of the objects in the class) can then be used to retrieve\r\nall images of, e.g. cars, in the data base because their\r\nrepresentations in the high-dimensional space will be closer to\r\nthe corresponding manifold than to any other.\r\n",
