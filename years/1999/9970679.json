Kansas State University\r\nStatic Analysis Based on Model Checking\r\n\r\nThis project aims toward integrating techniques based on temporal logic, program control-flow analysis, and data-flow analysis and applying the results to validating correctness and security properties of object-based and function-based programs. The work will proceed in two stages.  First, the connection between program data-flow analysis and model checking of program models, uncovered by Steffen, will be developed and strengthened so that model checking can be used as the tool of choice by compiler writers for mechanical analysis of programs.  In particular, the temporal logics used by model checkers will be adapted into specification languages for coding data-flow analyses and elementary security properties.  Second, the variant of program control-flow analysis known as ``k-CFA'' will be developed into a graphical formulation that can simply generate checkable models from higher-order object-based and functional programs.  (In the usual case, such programs do not have models that can be mechanically checked.)   Results from the research will impact the techniques that compiler writers and software engineers use to analyze programs and validate the programs' correctness and security.\r\n",
