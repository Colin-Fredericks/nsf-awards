 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tVasopressin is a brain hormone with a number of important functions in the\r\nbody.  Its primary function is maintaining the water balance of the body by\r\nregulating water excretion in the kidney.  Vasopressin also is involved in blood\r\npressure control and is an important part of the hormonal response to stress. \r\nVasopressin expression is altered by a wide variety of specific physiological inputs including blood concentration, dehydration, hemorrhage, low blood pressure, and stress.  The vasopressin response to these stimuli is regulated by a complex neuronal circuitry in the brain.  When physiological stimuli are sensed by some regions of the brain, signals are transmitted to other neurons where the vasopressin gene is activated to synthesize vasopressin.  Vasopressin is then transported to other regions of the brain or secreted into the bloodstream where it can exert its effects on the rest of the body.  The specific intra-cellular messengers involved in the regulation of the\r\nvasopressin gene are not known.  The specific aim of this project is to determine the intra-cellular mechanisms that mediate the response of vasopressin to specific physiological stimuli.  To accomplish this goal, cellular extracts will be obtained from the neurons of mice that are either in a resting state or have been exposed to a physiological stimulus.  Two laboratory techniques will be used to characterize the interactions between cellular proteins and the vasopressin gene.  Comparing the results obtained with resting and stimulated mice will help pinpoint the region of the vasopressin gene that is important in the response to each stimulus and will identify the intra-cellular protein messengers involved in the vasopressin response to different physiological stimuli.  These studies will lead to a better understanding of the control\r\nof water balance in the body, the contribution of vasopressin to blood pressure\r\ncontrol, and the hormonal responses of the body to stress.   \r\n",
