 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n\r\nAST 98-76143\r\nMihos\r\n\r\nRecent advances in observational facilities have lead to an explosion of information on the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the distant past (at high redshifts) to the present day.  This evolution is manifested through the changing morphology of cluster members, the increasing fraction of blue star-bursting galaxies at high redshift, and evidence of substructure in cluster galaxies and X-ray emitting gas.  A research project, which synthesizes dynamical simulations of galaxy evolution with observational studies of galaxy clusters to study these evolutionary processes in detail, will be carried out.\r\n\r\nNumerical simulations will be used to explore the process by which type SO galaxies form in clusters.  Different dynamical scenarios will be explored, including galaxy mergers, interactions within the cluster environment, and the effects of cluster ram-pressure stripping on galaxies. Numerical modeling techniques will also be developed to study the onset and evolution of starburst winds in galaxies, following the subsequent evolution of the host galaxies and the formation of the hot X-ray halos around elliptical galaxies and throughout galaxy clusters.\r\n\r\nExtremely deep imaging of the Virgo cluster of galaxies and other nearby galaxy clusters will be obtained to study the diffuse intracluster light (ICL). The ICL material is stripped from galaxies as they move through the cluster potential and the ICL acts as a fossil record of the dynamical history of the cluster.  The central area, 7 degrees by 7 degrees, of the Virgo cluster will be mapped to correlate the structure of the ICL with the properties of the Virgo galaxy population. The dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters in general will be investigated by studying the ICL across a variety of different environments from small groups to rich clusters of galaxies.\r\n\r\nOn the educational front, electronic lecturing techniques will be used to bring the most up-to-date scientific results into the classroom.  The creation of web-based curricula will allow students to review class lectures on demand and foster better interaction with, and comprehension of, class material.  The dynamical simulations of galaxy and cluster evolution will be used in multimedia computer presentations to bring material to students in a more engaging manner than simple text based lectures.  Laboratory courses in astrodynamics will be developed, centered around numerical simulation techniques applied on local computer platforms.  Student participation in observational laboratories will be fostered through the use of Case Western Reserve University's robotic telescope.   Undergraduate research assistants will be employed in all phases of the computational and observational research programs.  Students will have a hands-on experience in modern astrophysics and the scientific method.\r\n",
