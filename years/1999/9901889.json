Over the years, the series has incorporated both a science strand and a mathematics strand.  Nebraskans for Public Television is now producing two additional math-focused programs and one integrated math/science program.  These programs will further integrate math-oriented books into the series, will heighten the visibility of quality children's math-oriented books, and will model how children can understand and enjoy mathematics and science in the world around them.\r\n\r\nOutreach will be coordinated with libraries and museums nationwide.  The project also will expand the \"Math for Families Workshops,\" which were previously developed, from 50 public broadcasting stations to 100 stations.  The workshops also will be integrated into the PBS \"Ready To Learn\" endeavor.",
