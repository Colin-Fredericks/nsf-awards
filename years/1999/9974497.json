 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lawson\r\nMCB 9974497\r\n\r\nThe ubiquitin system, which selectively marks certain proteins for destruction by catalyzing the attachment of polymers of the 76-amino  acid ubiquitin molecule to the targeted protein, appears to be responsible for the rapid turnover of a number of key regulatory proteins in eukaryotic cells.  Very few viral proteins have, however, been proven to be substrates for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and no explorations of what roles the rapid turnover of these proteins play in virus replication have been carried out.  Considerable understanding of how the components of the ubiquitin-mediated system function has been gained in recent years, but major questions remain unanswered, including the mechanisms by which substrate proteins are selected for conjugation with ubiquitin. The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses encode a single large polyprotein, which is synthesized upon infection of the host cell.  This polyprotein is processed into individual functional proteins by a series of specific proteolytic cleavages, most of which are catalyzed by a protein, designated as the 3C protease, that resides within the viral polyprotein.  The mature 3C proteases of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) turn over rapidly, and in both cases the degradation is carried out by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic system, in contrast to 3C protease of  poliovirus which is  a poor substrate for the ubiquitin system. EMCV 3C protease is recognized by  two different ubiquitin-protein ligases.  One of these ligases, E3 , is responsible for most of the ubiquitin-3C protease conjugate synthesis which occurs in vitro, and the other, a ten-amino acid protein destruction signal sequence in the EMCV 3C protease is required for E3 to catalyze ubiquitin-3C protease conjugate synthesis.  Preliminary evidence has suggested that the HAV 3C protease also contains a similar destruction signal sequence.  This study uses the EMCV and HAV 3C proteases as model proteins to examine in detail the biochemical mechanisms by which ubiquitin system components interact with, and catalyze the attachment of ubiquitin to, rapidly degraded proteins.  The information so gained is likely to be applicable to the understanding of how other short-lived proteins are selected for destruction in mammalian cells.  In addition, the significance of the turnover rates of 3C proteases will be examined in terms of their impact on virus replication in infected cells.  This work will demonstrate whether the rapid turnover of viral proteins can be an integral and necessary event in the replication of certain viruses.  \r\n",
