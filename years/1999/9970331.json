 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will be a continuation of the investigator's research in the modular representation theories of algebraic groups and of finite symmetric groups, and to explore consequences and related results in combinatorics and number theory.  Projects to be undertaken include a determination of the integers n and primes p such that n has a self-conjugate p-core partition (this has implications in number theory and representation theory); a construction of the ordinary irreducible projective representations of the finite symmetric groups; and a more general investigation of the tensor product in the category of representations of the symmetric group.\r\n\r\nGroup theory is often described as ``the study of symmetry;'' indeed, the particular groups under consideration here are called symmetric groups.  Group theory arises and is used in a wide variety of other fields, including chemistry (crystallography), coding theory and cryptography, and solid state physics.  Understanding the structure of groups is the major task of group theory.  As every finite group is contained in a symmetric group, the symmetric groups play an important\r\nrole.\r\n\r\n",
