 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical language models are of considerable scientific importance, where they provide insight into the importance of various information sources for language understanding, and they have significant technological applications such as speech recognition and machine translation.  To date most statistical language models have concentrated on simple phrase-structure and lexical relationships.  This research investigates probabilistic models capable of describing richer combinatorial structures also found in human languages.  The goal of this research is to understand how humans learn a language and use it to communicate.  Because these linguistic processes seem to be inherently computational in nature---they crucially involve the transformation and manipulation of information-conveying representations---this research focuses on developing explicit computational models.  Besides the primary scientific goal of understanding the human language learning and processing mechanisms, the research also has important technological applications in areas such as automatic speech recognition, information extraction, summarization and indexing of on-line texts, translation of texts from one language to another by computer, etc.  This research is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and the Statistics and Probability Program under the Mid-Career Methodological Opportunities Fellowship Announcement.",
