With our negative resolution of this conjecture, the way is open to either determine that the invariants involved in that proof are a complete set, or to find new invariants and algorithms to effectively classify subshifts of finite type up to topological conjugacy.  We will consider group-theoretic, cohomological, and other methods.  We will also try to answer some questions raised by Nasu on his textile systems (already partly solved by Boyle and Maass).\r\n\r\nNontechnical description: Symbolic dynamics is a mathematical theory that can handle strings of symbols that can arise in many connections.  It has been used to formulate codes for efficient computer data storage and transmission.  It is an important and fundamental part of dynamical systems theory, which studies how systems (which might be something like the solar system, the earth's atmosphere, or the human body) change under time.  Symbolic dynamics has been applied to topological quantum field theory, which establishes a link to modern physics, and also to other important areas of mathematics such as the theory of knots.  The present proposal is primarily a project to classify subshifts of finite type, which are the most extensively studied kind of symbolic dynamical system.\r\n",
