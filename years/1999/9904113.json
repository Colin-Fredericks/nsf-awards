 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Enzyme Engineering Conference is the longest, continuous conference series that is sponsored by the Engineering Foundation. The first meeting was held in New Hampshire in 1971 and every other year thereafter. The meetings alternate between domestic and foreign locales. The conferences are generally attended by 150-200 world leaders in enzyme engineering research. Over half of the speakers are from foreign nations. The emphasis of the 1999 conference has been placed on \"directed evolution approaches for biocatalyst improvement and on the use of biocatalysis in the chemical industry.\"  Among the key sessions planned are:\r\nBiodiversity/new enzyme discovery\r\nDirected enzyme evolution\r\nAdvances in enzyme design\r\nEnzyme based processes in the chemical industry\r\nNew biotransformations\r\nCombinatorial biocatalysis/pathway engineering\r\nNew developments\r\n\r\nThe conference will provide an excellent opportunity for U.S. researchers to network with foreign scientists in the field, many of whom come from countries with extensive enzyme-use history.\r\n\r\n",
