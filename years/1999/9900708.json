 "awd_abstract_narration": "9900708\r\nPachavis\r\nA symposium will be held at the 1998 Fall MRS Meeting on \"Growth Instabilities and Decomposition During Heteroepitaxy\". The goal of the conference is to bring together both theoreticians and experimentalists from disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials science, and electrical engineering to address fundamentals and applications of growth instabilities occurring during a wide variety of thin film growth processes. A further objective is to stimulate collaboration and discussion between researchers, especially between young professionals and established experts and to identify critical issues for future research. The conference brings together industrial and academic scientists in an effort to encourage collaboration between these groups. Support from NSF will be used to partially compensate young scientists (junior faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) for travel and accommodation expenses. The conference is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific issues in growth instabilities during heteroepitaxy with a focus on elastic strain induced self assembly. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established between universities, research institutions, and industry.\r\n%%%\r\nElastic strains, induced either by lattice mismatch or compositional inhomogenieties, present both challenges and opportunities for the production of novel electronic and optoelectronic devices. In some cases, strain is deleterious, leading to defective or non-planar films. On the other hand, strain-driven islanding provides a direct route for the production of self-assembled nanostructures. Semiconducting lattice-mismatched materials have far reaching economic potential since applications range broadly across electronics and photonics associated with computing, communications, and information processing. An evaluation of the progress and status of this field along with current assessments of the most important developments will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of electronic/photonic materials in applications beneficial to society.\r\n***\r\n",
