PASEN addresses the technology education needs of teachers by creating a model professional community of science educators, district personnel, intermediate unit staff, professional development experts, and science educational content providers.  By integrating the current science education reform efforts with PASEN, it establishes a systemic and electronic program that is replicable and scalable. \r\n \r\nCompanion units are produced that tie to the state frameworks and thus support classrooms regardless of science textbook.  The companions support a number of standards-based kit programs, principally STC, FOSS, INSIGHTS, and SEPUP.  In addition to the workshops and ongoing support, the project includes Current Science News, Live Event Webcasts, Peer Forums, the Mentor Center, and the Publication Center.\r\n \r\nIn the three-year duration of the project, 200 K-8 teachers will receive at least 122 hours of inservice education that will help them adapt their curriculum to the standards and integrate technology into teaching and learning in their schools.  This is a collaboration of the Franklin Institute with the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Philadelphia USI, and the Center for Agile Pennsylvania, selected school districts, and regional science alliances.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
