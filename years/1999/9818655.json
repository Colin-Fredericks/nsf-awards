 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stereotypes are believed to exist only when there is a socially meaningful categorical distinction between two or more classes of persons, such as different racial groups. The experiments supported by this planning grant test the hypothesis that light and dark skin tone represent distinct subcategories of black persons. Fictional works and historical accounts suggest that skin tone plays an important role in the black American community. In addition, these sources strongly suggest the existence of stereotypes about skin tone that bias one's perceptions of blacks. Although many researchers have measured beliefs about skin tone, or examined the proposed consequences of skin tone bias, few have tried to understand the causal role of skin tone in this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe planning activities for this research will take place in three phases. The first phase involves the collection of photographs of blacks and digital alteration of the skin tone of the persons pictured. The second phase involves preliminary testing of the photographs and two experiments using a group discussion paradigm. The third and final phase will involve analyses of the data collected from the experiments, interpretation of the results, dissemination of the findings at professional conferences, and discussion of the findings with colleagues.\r\n\r\n",
