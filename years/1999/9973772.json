 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been thought that the process of learning one's native language is biologically predetermined, leaving little room for the role of \"learning.\"  However, recent research in infant speech perception shows that very young language learners are extremely sensitive to statistically prominent aspects of the sound structure of the language to which they are exposed.  Furthermore, some preliminary research on children's language production indicates interesting crosslinguistic differences in the timing of acquisition of syllable and word structures:  Language structures of low frequency in a particular language are acquired late.  This points to the need for more sophisticated statistical analysis of both the language input that children hear and how this shapes the course of children's language development.  However, researchers of language acquisition are generally trained as linguists or experimental psychologists and lack knowledge of the basic mathematical and computational methods needed to address these issues.  Thus, training in statistics and mathematical modeling techniques is becoming a necessity, especially for researchers like the principal investigator who work on large corpora of children's longitudinal language development over time.  This POWRE grant will provide her with a full year in which to learn more about basic statistical and mathematical modeling techniques.  This program of study will feed directly into the goals of Brown University's new NSF IGERT (Integrated Graduate Education Research and Training) grant, designed to provide graduate students with multidisciplinary training in applying statistical methods to problems of cognitive science.   Her short-term goal is to identify a set of statistical methods appropriate for investigating how language learning takes place, focusing specifically on how much of what types of information children need for language learning to succeed.  In particular, she will focus on children's acquisition of higher-level phonological units such as syllable and word structure, as well as on interactions at the syntax/semantics interface, such as learning the argument structure of verbs.  A long-term practical goal is to use results of this research to address the problems of children with various types of language learning delay, including those with Specific Language Impairment and partial hearing loss.",
