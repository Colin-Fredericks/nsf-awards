 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project tests and integrates a simple, easy-to-assemble and inexpensive data logger designed to record analog signals from a wide variety of sensors in the field. This \"proof-of-concept\" project establishes the versatility, reliability, precession and accuracy of the data logger and provides a number of examples of how the data logger integrates into the science curriculum. Funds cover faculty salaries, undergraduate student summer help, and essential equipment including data loggers, a variety of sensors, various test equipment and computers. The curricular improvements focus on two fields, hydrogeology and computer architecture.  In hydrology, data loggers collect flow characteristics within and between stream basins and massbalance data. In computer science, data loggers are used for design, programming, A/D conversions and other modifications. The data logger is an inexpensive solution for data gathering over time and integrates nicely with the recent rise in earth systems science and embedded computer systems. The interdisciplinary results allows geoscience students and computer science colleagues to build specific sensors and/or logger design modifications to detect specific environmental parameters. Dissemination of this inexpensive data logger specifications and curricular improvements are posted on the Web, presented at regional and national meetings, and submitted to appropriate educational journals. The Web site contains data-logger plans, circuit diagrams, circuit board layouts, parts list, suppliers, user manuals, and tutorials so that educators (college or high school) can download these items and construct her/his own data loggers. The team has initiated plans for the complete dissemination and independent testing of the data logger and its curricular integration across the nation at completion of the project.",
