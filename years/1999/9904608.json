 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last 16 years of this NSF-funded project, considerable progress has been made in using development as a powerful analytic tool for dissociating different forms of learning and memory in Aplysia on behavioral and cellular levels. These dissociations have in turn provided insights into both the similarities and differences in the mechanisms subserving different forms of learning and memory in this simple model system. In the present cycle period, we will continue to use this research strategy to investigate a fundamental question that has driven the project from the outset: the relationship between short-term and long-term memory. In addition, we will extend the project into a novel domain, examining the role of growth factors in development and learning in Aplysia.\r\nDevelopment of multiple memory phases in Aplysia\r\nIn this phase of the project we will examine the developmental assembly of several phases of memory: short-term, intermediate-term and long-term. This work will be carried out in both adult and developing animals on several interactive levels of analysis, including behavioral, synaptic and molecular levels. There are two primary objectives in this phase of the work: (i) to fully characterize the final adult phenotype in terms of memory processing capacity, and (ii) to analyze in detail the mechanistic assembly of memory processing during development.\r\nThe role of growth factors in development and learning\r\nMany families of growth factors contribute importantly to developmental processes in vertebrate systems, and some of these factors are now clearly implicated in several forms of synaptic plasticity thought to contribute to learning and memory. We have recently found that specific growth factors can induce long-term synaptic changes in Aplysia sensory neurons and can regulate structural events in different types of Aplysia neurons in unique and cell-specific fashion. Thus in this phase if the project, using cellular, molecular and structural levels of analysis, we will examine the role of specific growth factors both in the developmental assembly of the central nervous system and in regulating memory formation in adult animals. A significant strength of this new direction is that the mechanistic roles of the growth factors in both development and learning can be directly analyzed and compared in the same experimental system.\r\nThe overall project will have a significant impact on advancing knowledge from two different perspectives. First, from a basic scientific perspective the project will elucidate fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms used to induce lasting plasticity in both development and learning. Second, from an educational perspective insights derived from this project may be of basic utility in understanding (on a mechanistic level) the way in which our ability to learn and remember is influenced by critical developmental factors, and thus could be of considerable importance to the general field of education, considered in its broadest terms.\r\n",
