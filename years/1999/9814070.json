 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe Washington State Gender Equity Project is a collaborative project throughout the State of Washington.  Its goal is to transform the teacher education establishment in the state -- higher education institutions that certify new teachers, the state education agency, the state teachers union, and state professional associations in mathematics and science education and in teacher education -- by incorporating gender equity into existing instruction, policy and procedures.  The project will be managed by a steering committee of representatives of each participating organization.\r\n\tAfter all of the teacher-certifying institutions (there are 22) that want to participate are identified, we will hold a five-day seminar on gender equity in mathematics, science, and technology for 60 or more people from the participating organizations.  A team at each organization will form to undertake a gender equity needs assessment with project materials, after which they will plan and implement corrective instructional, procedural, and/or policy strategies as appropriate, with costs defrayed by the project.  Project staff will provide frequent technical assistance to all organizations, plus monitoring activities.  Toward the end of the project there will be a dissemination meeting at which participating organizations will present to state and national colleagues.  A guide will be produced for subsequent national replication.\r\n\tDuring the project, nearly 6,000 preservice teachers (about two-thirds of all in the state) will be reached, through 150 faculty and 25 agency and association staff.  Significant statewide increases in the number of girls taking regular and advanced electives in mathematics, science, and technology should be noticeable within five to ten years.\r\n",
