Such a spectroscopically determined force field (SDFF) will be developed for the polypeptide chain. This will be based on the same protocol used in this laboratory to produce SDFFs for saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains. A preliminary SDFF for a non-hydrogen-bonded polypeptide chain has been obtained from scaled ab initio calculations of glycine and alanine dipeptides, and this SDFF will be fully optimized. The present preliminary development of a spectroscopically sound electrostatic model for the hydrogen bond will be completed. These two functions will then be combined to produce an SDFF for the hydrogen-bonded polypeptide chain.  Similar calculations will provide parameters for all protein side chains. This force field will be used in structural and dynamics studies of peptide and protein systems.\r\n\r\nInteractions between biomolecules can be accurately modeled in computer simulations only if the dynamic properties of the molecules, not just their static structures, are properly accounted for. This means that the energy functions describing the dynamics of the molecules, in significant part represented by their spectroscopic properties, must be comparably accurate. Present energy functions do not sufficiently satisfy this criterion. This research program will produce such accurate functions for proteins, making possible much more reliable predictions of their biological properties. This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Divisions of Physics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. \r\n",
