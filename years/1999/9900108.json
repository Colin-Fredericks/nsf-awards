 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project are to analyze the causes of tool vibration and hole roundness error in high-precision and high-speed drilling and reaming; and, to apply the results of this analysis to tool and process design for aerospace manufacturing.  The work is a collaborative effort between researchers at Washington University in St. Louis and engineers at the Boeing Company.  In metal cutting, vibrations are excited by forces on the tool's main cutting edges, as well as by impact and friction on the sides and clearance faces of the tool.  The project will develop accurate models of reaming and drilling, including drilling in high-speed, automated stations. These models will take into account bending, axial, and twisting motion, and the effects of these deformations on cutting forces and friction. Analytical and numerical solutions will be obtained from these models to explain the major causes of vibration.  Approximate nonlinear methods will be developed to find the amplitude and stability of vibrations in drilling. Experimental work will be conducted at Boeing's Advanced Manufacturing R&D facilities to validate the analytical and numerical results.  Cutting and vibration tests on physical machines will be performed to provide parameters for mathematical models and to validate theoretical predictions. \r\n     This project addresses the need to understand the precision hole-making process, which is critical to airframe manufacturing. A million or more holes may be drilled in the production of a single aircraft. Automated assembly, high-speed drilling, and advanced tool designs have the potential to dramatically increase productivity and decrease costs, but only if the complex dynamics of hole-making are understood.\r\n",
