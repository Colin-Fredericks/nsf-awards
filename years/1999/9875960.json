 "awd_abstract_narration": "CCR-9875960\r\nVijaykumar\r\n\r\nTraditionally, the gap between processor and main memory speeds has been bridged by placing a hierarchy of cache memories containing successive levels of slower, larger caches between the processor and main memory accesses that miss in the faster levels of the hierarchy underscoring the need for better cache hierarchy management.\r\n\r\nThe ever-increasing number of on-chip transistors can be employed to track dynamic information relevant to memory accesses.  This project investigates novel hardware techniques to allow flexible cache management without excessive overheads.  The techniques comprise of (1) providing flexible management through high cache associativity, (2) providing a shortcut from instructions to cache frames to avoid the overhead of high associativity, (3) tracking the instructions that compute the address of a cache miss to initiate a prefetch by executing such address computations, early, and (4) tracking the instructions that access cache blocks to enable replacement of less useful blocks by more useful data.  Performance achieved by the proposed hardware-based techniques is evaluated by testing widely used benchmarks through a detailed software simulator.\r\n",
