This work, lying at the common focus of two\r\nbroad set-theoretic research efforts, namely, forcing and large cardinals,\r\nseems particularly promising in light of the recent advances that have\r\nemerged from his earlier work with gap forcing and the lottery preparation.\r\nSpecifically, Professor Hamkins will investigate a series of open questions\r\nconcerning the extent to which indestructibility is possible with various\r\nkinds of large cardinals, with a particular focus on the strongly compact\r\ncardinals.  In addition to this work, he will continue his work on two other\r\nprojects, the automorphism tower problem and the new theory of infinite time\r\nTuring machines, a model of infinitary computation.\r\n     Professor Hamkins' research involves the study of the sublime, \r\ninaccessible notions of mathematical infinity, which have fascinated \r\nmathematicians for centuries.  In the twentieth century, particularly in \r\nthe past thirty years, set theorists have gained a profound understanding\r\nof the largest of these transfinite numbers, large cardinals.  Professor\r\nHamkins has been particularly interested in how large cardinals are\r\naffected by forcing, the technique invented by Paul Cohen by which set\r\ntheorists have had glimpses into alternative mathematical universes and\r\nrealized the rich diversity of mathematical possibility.  Much of his work\r\ntherefore lies in the common focus of two major set-theoretic research\r\nefforts, namely, forcing and large cardinals.  He will endeavor to\r\ninvestigate the curious indestructibility phenomena of these cardinals, by\r\nwhich their largeness survives in a wide variety of mathematical universes.  \r\n***\r\n",
