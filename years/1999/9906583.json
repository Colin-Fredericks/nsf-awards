 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kim Dunbar is being supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division to elucidate structure/magnetochemical relationships in several families of magnetic clusters and materials. Specifically, the work proposed (i) will expand recent findings in Dr. Dunbar's laboratory that binary transition metal compounds of the TCNQ anion radical with Fe, Co, Mn and Ni exhibit a ferromagnetic-like behavior best described as a spin glass; (ii) will explore polypyridine-type ligands in open-shell metal systems of varied geometries in which metals will be able to communicate with each other; and (iii) will examine molecular assemblies in which octahedral metal ions are used to synthesize paramagnetic squares and cubes with cyano or metal-dicyano linkages.\t\t\r\n\r\nThe knowledge base derived from the projects will have a significant impact in physics and in materials research; in addition, it will provide an understanding of molecule-based magnetic materials. Novel molecular materials will be discovered that will have fundamental technological relevance in such applications as magnetic storage devices, electrically or magnetically bistable devices and miniaturization of magnetics to the nanoscale level. Graduate and undergraduate students, and post-doctoral associates will be trained in an area that has exceptional importance and that will open up venues for either industrial or academic employment.",
