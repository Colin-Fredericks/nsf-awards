 "awd_abstract_narration": "Progressive coding and transmission of images and video\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed explosive growth of digital video in communications, medicine, education and entertainment. Examples are digital TV, DVD, Internet video, and telemedicine. Major driving forces behind such growth have been the striding advances made in digital technologies for image/video compression, storage, computing, and transmission. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to integrate the PI's research on image/video compression with his teaching plan. The research plan addresses the following three aspects in coding and transmission of images and video: coding performance, coding functionality, and progressive transmission. A diverse yet focused set of research \r\nprojects are proposed with regard to these three areas, linked by a multiresolutional wavelet transform thread. The teaching plan takes into account the unique position of the University of Hawaii. It focuses on teaching our students both technical and interactive skills that enable them to compete with others from mainland schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
