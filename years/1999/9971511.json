Wise\r\n\r\nAbstract:  \r\n\r\nThe investigator will study the relationship between negative curvature and residual finiteness. The former is a geometric property which has a substantial impact on topology, and the latter is a purely algebraic property. However, the investigator has recently developed a surprising connection between these seemingly unrelated notions. The investigator will show that in many important cases, negatively curved spaces have residually finite fundamental groups. Similar methods will often yield the more dramatic result that quasiconvex subgroups are separable in the profinite topology. One important consequence of this work will be to demonstrate that certain hyperbolic link complements have the property that their immersed incompressible surfaces lift to embeddings in finite covers. A fundamental problem in topology is to classify the different types of 3-manifolds. When a 3-manifold contains an embedded incompressible surface, this classification can be achieved. More generally, if a 3-manifold has a finite cover containing an embedded surface, then this classification can be achieved. Residual finiteness and the related property of separability, are crucial ingredients needed to produce these finite covers. The aim of this project is to add these ingredients to the arsenal of low-dimensional topologists and geometers.  \r\n\r\nNearly all scientific thought concerns itself with discovering and understanding patterns. Symmetry is one of the most fundamental types of patterns. The study of symmetry ranges from the Platonic solids of the ancient Greeks to the groups occurring in modern particle physics.  A \"group\" is the complete set of symmetries of a geometric object. The symmetries of the object help us to understand its shape and nature.  For example, a ball has infinitely many symmetries, belonging to two classes: \"rotational\" symmetries, obtained by rotating the ball through any axis running through its center (just as our earth is now rotating), and \"bilateral\" symmetries, obtained by reflecting the ball through planes passing through its center (the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth are interchanged when we reflect through the equatorial plane). The easiest groups of symmetries to understand are finite groups of symmetries, such as the group of eight symmetries of a square. Sometimes an infinite group can be `collapsed' into a finite group. This collapse is similar to the projection of a shadow, and by examining enough of these shadows, one can glean information about the original infinite group. The investigator will study various infinite groups of symmetries that arise in conjunction with certain topological and geometric objects (3-manifolds and negatively curved spaces), which have recently been the focus of major study. The investigator will demonstrate that these infinite groups have sufficiently many finite shadows. This will elucidate the structure of these infinite groups and in turn will lead to a better understanding of the original geometric objects.         \r\n",
