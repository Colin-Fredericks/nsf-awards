In identity theory, a person acts in a self-regulatory manner with the goal of matching meanings of the self in a situation with the identity meanings in one's standard.  This self-regulation is ongoing and continuous, often requiring little attention.  A person becomes more attentive when the normal state of continuous congruence gets interrupted in a situation.  Then, the person responds with autonomic arousal subjectively experienced as negative emotion.  In identity theory, it is hypothesized that repeated interruptions in the identity process cause more negative emotion than occasional or infrequent interruptions.  This hypothesis is applied to the distributive justice process regarding individuals' emotional responses to injustice.\r\n\r\nDistributive theory has much in common with identity theory.  In particular, distributive justice theorists also conceptualize the self as acting in a self-regulatory manner with the goal of matching one's actual reward in a situation with one's expected reward.  Congruence registers the experience of justice and incongruence registers the experience of injustice in a situation.  Negative emotion follows from the cognitive evaluation of incongruence. \r\n\r\nTwo experiments will be conducted to test the emotional responses of individuals to unjust situations.  Each experiment simulates a work situation and subjects are asked to perform four simple clerical tasks.  They are told that their pay (reward) is based on their performance on these tasks. In the first experiment, subjects with either be given an under-reward, expected reward, or over-reward at prearranged intervals throughout their task performance (high persistence), or they will receive their reward after task completion (low persistence).  The second experiment will be set up like the first with one addition.  Subjects will be made to feel that either they are responsible for the reward they receive (self as responsible) or the experimenter is responsible for the reward they receive (other responsible).  In both experiments, subject's standard of justice while in the worker role will be measured.  Additionally, subjects' emotions will be measured throughout task performance by 1) videotaping facial expressions and bodily responses and applying an emotion coding scheme t the videotapes, and 2) obtaining self-reports on subjects current feelings.\r\n\r\nIn general, this research develops identity theory by testing some of its theoretical assumptions regarding emotions as well as examining other emotions not yet explored in the theory.  It also broadens distributive justice research by applying some of the theoretical advances in identity theory to distributive justice theory.  Finally, this research advances the area of sociology of emotions by examining how a theory of self-regulation that both identity theory and distributive justice theory assumes can explain different emotions in situations.\r\n",
