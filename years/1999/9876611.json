Technology is used both as a delivery vehicle and as a tool to support mathematics teaching and learning activities in participants' classrooms.  Through this project a cadre is established of more than 1,000 educators who are aware of current trends and thinking in mathematics education and who are innovative in their thinking about the integration of technology into mathematics teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nInterMath has two primary components: 1) a 100-hour intensive hands-on workshop (45 hour) including local implementation at participant sites (55 hours); and 2) a follow-along system which will support teachers beyond the initial workshops.  The 55-hour site based component is threaded throughout the 45-hour workshop and will focus heavily on scaffolding teachers' in-school reform efforts while participating educators are engaged in the intensive workshop experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
