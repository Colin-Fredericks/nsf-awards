This system is necessary for the realization of many projects in the Departments of Electrical Engineering, Materials Science Research Center of Excellence, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Physics, and will act as a catalyst for research in other departments as well at Howard University.  The availability of the proposed RIE machine will specially assist the teaching and research activities of the newly established Materials Science and Engineering Program (MSEP).  Among the devices to be realized are A1GaN/GaN and InGaN/GaN double heterojunction photodetectors employing conventional and resonant cavity enhancement designs.  Moreover, GaN quantum well lasers and LEDs as well as A1GaN and BN homojunctions intended for Deep UV detection will be explored.  The objective would be to explore improved dry etching processes for devices with materials combinations that can yield strains advantageous for right kind of carrier transport in p-i-n diodes.  The main thrust of proposed research would also be to investigate and utilize RIE technique for the fabrication of new semiconductor heterostructure devices with improved optical, electrical and structural characteristics.  Efforts would specially be directed towards exploring new epitaxial wide bandgap semiconductor device concepts, and towards developing a laser and a photodetector technology base for sensors for commercial and military applications.\r\n***\r\n",
