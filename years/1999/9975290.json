 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates differences between group and individual judgment on tasks involving ambiguity. Most decisions and judgments must be made on the basis of information that is incomplete or less than perfect. These judgment situations are often characterized as involving uncertainty or ambiguity. This project will examine the various types of ambiguity and how ambiguity affects judgment and decision making.  Previous studies have investigated how decisions made by individuals have been affected by ambiguity and other individual and task factors. However, many important judgments and decisions are made by groups. Ambiguity effects previously observed among individuals will be examined in a group decision making context, with a focus on directly comparing judgments made by groups to those made by individuals. In addition, factors likely to moderate ambiguity effects, such as cognitive frame and outcome value, will also be investigated to identify possible boundary conditions for differences between individuals and groups. The primary goals associated with this planning grant are to: (1) integrate theories about ambiguity effects on individual judgment with more general models of group judgment and decision making; (2) develop tasks and methods to directly compare how individual and group judgments are affected by ambiguity; and (3) identify one or more factors that influence the degree to which ambiguity differentially affects individual and group judgments.\r\n",
