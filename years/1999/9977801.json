Funds are provided for the purchase of an aircraft that will be modified to carry recently acquired state-of-the art remote sensing instrumentation and related computing equipment.  The university will provide for the upkeep of the aircraft and has committed three years of funding to support three graduate students in each of those years who will be conducting research associated with this new facility.  The University of Nebraska has existing, well-respected research and education programs built around information from satellite remote sensing data that will be markedly enhanced by access to this new facility.  Airborne positioning of remote sensing equipment will allow calibrated and controlled remote sensing measurements not currently possible with ground-based systems.  Remote sensing information is relevant to many aspects of Nebraska's largely rural economy.  This facility will serve a broad diversity of researchers conducting research in such areas as Global Climate, Flood Mapping, Water Resource Monitoring, Vegetation Cover Inventories, Pollution Monitoring, and Land Use \r\n",
