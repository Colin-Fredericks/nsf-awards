The US organizer is Dr. Qaisar Shafi, Professor of Physics, Bartol Research Institute, University of Delaware.  The Egyptian organizer is Dr. Shaaban Khalil, of the Department of Mathematics, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.  This is the first such meeting to be held in that region, and includes the following topics for discussion: status of the standard model, Neutrino Physics, Phenomenology of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, Experimental searches of Supersymmetry, Supergravity, String Theory, Dualities, M-theory, and Particle Physics and Cosmology.  In addition to the US participants, there will be participants from several European research centers such as CERN and from universities in Europe.\r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow US scientists to participate in a meeting, with physicists from Egypt and other countries in the region, to discuss recent advances in various areas in the field of high energy physics.  The US group is expected to include five graduate students and postdoctoral scientists.  Lectures will be presented mainly by the US and the European participants and also by physicists from the region.  The US participants include some of the most eminent scientists in the field. Other participants from Europe are also among the best known high-energy physicists.  This meeting is to encourage physicists and students of physics from the region to participate in this exciting area, especially in the theoretical part, which does require expensive equipment or facilities.  It will also encourage them to participate in experimental work in the United States and Europe.  The participation of graduate students and postdoctoral staff will give them early international science experience.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting meetings with high potential for increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit. \r\n",
