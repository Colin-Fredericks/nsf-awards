The platform will consist of approximately six physically distributed sites.  Each site will have a rack of four PCs to run distributed experiments; these can be loaded with experimental operating systems or applications programs. One of the machines will serve as a remote system management node to provide authentication, resource management, and termination of runaway experiments.   The nodes will be connected by UCAID's Abilene Internet2.  This facility will prototype the capability for researchers across the country to access this unique experimental facility. This platform will be the basis for developing a proposal for a larger platform with additional nodes to support research in distributed systems and applications.\r\n",
