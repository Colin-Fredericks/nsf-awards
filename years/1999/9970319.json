 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose studying fundamental qualitative properties of various classes\r\nof nonlinear dynamical systems, as they arise from differential equations.\r\nIn particular, our emphasis is devoted to lattice dynamical systems (that\r\nis, spatially discrete systems) and differential delay equations. Questions\r\nrelated to the existence of equilibria of lattice systems which exhibit\r\nspatial patterns, traveling wave solutions which are asymptotic to such\r\npatterns, anisotropic (crystallographic) pinning of such waves, and related\r\nstability properties, will be studied. We also propose to study such systems\r\nwith time delays (cyclic systems), and to observe the emergence of patterns\r\nresulting from a singular perturbation structure. A significant portion of\r\nthe proposed research involves the development and implementation of new\r\ntools and techniques, as well as the extension of existing techniques of\r\ndynamical systems to new situations.\r\n\r\nWe are developing new mathematical techniques in order to analyze differential\r\nequations which arise as models in various areas of science.  A wide range of\r\nscientific disciplines is represented, including biology, chemistry, electrical\r\ncircuit theory, image processing, and material science. While this is a very\r\nbroad scope of inquiry, the specific problems to be studied exhibit features\r\nin common -- spontaneous formation of patterns, self-sustained fronts and\r\noscillations, regulation by internal feedback (often with time delays) --\r\nwhich can be analyzed with some of the basic tools of dynamical systems theory.\r\nIt is expected that the resulting the mathematical advances arising from these\r\nstudies will increase the knowledge of, and will provide insight into both the\r\nabstract theory of dynamical systems, and the scientific areas of inquiry.\r\n\r\n",
