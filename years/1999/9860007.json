A new, innovative process is proposed that should form strongly adherent, high temperature, oxidation resistant coatings on steel alloys, iron and nickel superalloys, aluminides, and superalloy matrix composites.  Using this process, the firm has produced two  protective coatings, with coating-to substrate bond strength that has been measured to be in excess of 7.3 kgf/mm2 (over 10,000 psi), and which have been formed on three different aluminum containing alloy substrates.  Full testing to evaluate the integrity of these coatings will be performed in Phase I.  Planned Phase II work will continue that and include lifetime testing of the coatings in cyclic and static, high temperature oxidizing environments.\r\n     These coatings have broad application in industry throughout the nation.  Products that utilize the firm's coatings, can achieve longer lifetimes because of the surface protection provided by the coatings.  Such longer product lifetimes translate directly to user dollar savings that would yield both national economic benefits and create products that are more competitive in foreign markets.\r\n",
