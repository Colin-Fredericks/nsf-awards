Aptamers isolated from random sequence\r\npools, including RNAs that specifically bind the enzymatic cofactors\r\ncyanocobalamin and biotin and the chromophore malachite green, will serve\r\nas model systems.  Focus is placed on biochemical characterization of these\r\nmolecules and on the preparation of crystals and solution samples that will\r\nenable their analysis by x-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. The\r\nstructures of cyanocobalamin and biotin aptamer crystals will be determined\r\nby X-ray crystallography and the isotopically-labeled malachite green\r\naptamer RNA by solution NMR spectroscopy. This is to understand the\r\nspecific atomic interactions that stabilize RNA folding, the variety of\r\nstructural folds available to RNA, the involvement of metals and waters in\r\nRNA function, and the nature of conformational changes in RNA that result\r\nfrom its interaction with other molecules. The educational component of\r\nthis project aims to use structural biology for introducing students to the\r\nphysical sciences through a combination of both classroom and laboratory\r\ninstruction.   New and modified curricula in eukaryotic molecular biology\r\nand structural biology, supplemented by the development of computer-based\r\neducational materials, will be developed to establish the relationship\r\nbetween macromolecular structure and function.  Selected number of\r\nstudents will be encouraged to engage in the research.\r\n\r\n2.  Non-technical: The capacity for ribonucleic acids (RNAs) to fold into\r\nspecific conformations and thereby obtain functional properties (e.g. the\r\nability to bind molecules or to catalyze reactions) has been increasingly\r\nappreciated, in part through experiments in which RNAs have been evolved de\r\nnovo from pools of random sequence molecules.  This recognition has fueled\r\nspeculation about the involvement of RNAs in many biological processes\r\n(e.g. ribosome-directed protein synthesis) and supported theories favoring\r\nan RNA-based biology as a precursor to modern life.  Our understanding of\r\nthe structural basis for RNA function, critical for addressing these\r\nissues, remains poor in part because few RNA structures have been\r\ndetermined at atomic resolution. In vitro-evolved ligand-binding RNAs will\r\nserve as model systems for understanding RNA structure and its relationship\r\nto RNA function.  X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy will be used\r\nin this study to determine high resolution models for three different\r\nRNA-ligand complexes.  Analysis of these structures will reveal the\r\nmechanisms by which specific RNA sequences adopt unique structures and how\r\nthese structures enable specific interactions with other molecules.\r\nIntegrating these studies with teaching, this study provides undergraduate\r\nstudents with basic skills in structural biology. Enhancements to existing\r\neukaryotic molecular biology curricula will emphasize the concept that\r\nbiological processes are driven by molecular interactions specified by the\r\nfolded conformations of macromolecules.  A new course in structural biology\r\nwill expand upon this theme with the additional goal of providing\r\ninterdisciplinary training in applied physical and computational sciences.\r\n\r\n",
