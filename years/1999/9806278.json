 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bradshaw\r\n9806278\r\nThe investigators are concerned with factors that affect the ability of plant or animal species to invade and persist in the temperate zone of North America.  Range expansion into progressively more northern latitudes should involve two separate adaptations to temperature (a) to the duration and intensity of winter cold and (b) to the timing of seasonal events, i.e., the \"fitting\" of growth, development, and reproduction into the available growing season.  In this proposal, the investigators test explicitly for the relative importance of these two sources of adaptation to temperature over the climatic gradient of eastern and central North America.  In a wide variety of studies on how temperature relates to the ecology of organisms, it is usually assumed that environmental temperatures limit range expansion directly, and that range expansion occurs because of adaptive modification of cold tolerance.  The investigators argue that the opposite process usually occurs: adaptive modification in cold tolerance takes place after populations are well-established and after the seasonal development and hibernation of populations has adapted to the local seasonal cycle. The investigators will pursue this proposition experimentally, using the pitcher-plant mosquito as our model organism; they will test the specific hypothesis that fitness of this species from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada is due to adaptations that affect the timing of seasonal development and hibernation and not due to adaptations that affect cold-tolerance. These experiments have important implications for global warming.  Discussions of\r\nglobal warming are limited to the direct effects of the duration and intensity of temperatures on plant and animal survival.  However, adaptation to changes in seasonality can evolve very rapidly in some organisms.  When facing global climate change, organisms may not need to confront the extreme temperatures directly; rather they may simply evade these extremes by modifying the timing of important events in the seasonal life history.  The investigators seek to determine whether it is the direct effect of change in habitat temperature that is most likely to impact animal fitness, or whether it is the indirect effect of season length that affects fitness and, ultimately, survival.\r\n\r\n",
