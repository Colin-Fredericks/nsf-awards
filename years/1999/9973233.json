This software has been set up so that\r\nit can be used remotely, via the internet.  This means that\r\nresearchers world-wide can use the software by logging on to the\r\nMagnus server.  The project uses Internet-based facilities to\r\nmaintain a list of outstanding open problems and to set up\r\nseveral discussion groups focusing on related mathematical areas.\r\nThese support collaboratory interactions among users, including\r\nresearchers in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and\r\nChina.  Software development includes the introduction of genetic\r\nalgorithms as well as measures to allow users to add their own\r\nroutines to Magnus, extending the scope of the tool.  The\r\ninvestigators also use Magnus to study problems in pure group\r\ntheory and in commutative algebra.  The project includes the\r\ntraining of students.\r\n     In mathematics, group theory aims to capture and study the\r\nessence of symmetry, particularly in patterns.  Such patterns\r\noccur frequently in nature, for instance as crystals.  Its\r\nconnection with symmetry makes group theory important in physics,\r\nin biology, and in the study of our physical world, as well as in\r\ngeometry and other mathematical fields such as the theory of\r\ncomputation and cryptography.  The investigators' goal in this\r\nproject is to build an easy-to-use computational tool that makes\r\nit possible for a user to carry out experiments and solve\r\nproblems about the most ubiquitous of the mathematical objects\r\ninvolved here, the so-called finitely presented groups.  These are\r\ngroups that can be described completely by a finite set of rules;\r\nexamples include the group of rigid geometric motions of an\r\nobject and the groups of quantum mechanics.  The computational\r\ntool, Magnus, has a simple but limited interface.  Nevertheless,\r\nMagnus has already been used to explore and solve a number of\r\ndifficult problems in group theory.  The present project focuses\r\non algorithmic developments and techniques to allow users to add\r\ntheir own routines to Magnus, extending the scope of the tool.\r\nThe project also provides Internet-accessible computation and\r\ninformation resources in a collaboratory setting, fostering\r\nInternet-based interchanges and collaborations among researchers.\r\nFinally, the project helps train students in both computation and\r\nmathematics.\r\n",
