Such partnerships last four to five years. Males prefer a female that is larger and reject small females.  Females prefer a male with large head width and will reject small-headed males. The proposed study explores the fitness benefits of choosiness for both males and females.  A field experiment will be conducted on 30 naturally-paired adults and 30 experimentally-matched-paired adults.  Pairs of the two groups will be transplanted to logs and allowed to produce offspring over a six month period.  Following this period, Dr. Shellman-Reeve will determine which control and manipulated pairs have the highest (and lowest) indicators of fitness: adult survival, colony survival, offspring number and size, territory size, and paternity will be measured.  The study will show whether mate choice has a fitness benefit, and if so, whether the mate-choosiness is more important for females or for males.\r\n\tThe proposed project tests a critical prediction of parental investment theory. Namely, when both males and females provide extensive care to offspring, both should be choosy when seeking their lifetime partner, particularly when mate-choosiness provides strong fitness benefits.  This planned investigation is certain to deepen our knowledge of mate choice in socially monogamous animals where both parents provide extensive care to offspring. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
