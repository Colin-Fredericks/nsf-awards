 "awd_abstract_narration": "This full EMD project addresses the problem of how to motivate students who are not majoring in computer and information systems(CIS) to take a second level information technology (IT) course in order to provide them with a strong IT background to prepare them for future careers.  A framework and comprehensive assessment procedure is being developed for a new IT course, \"Problem-Solving and Lifelong Learning.\"   \r\n\r\nThe course provides non-CIS majors the experience and conceptual tools needed for the effective use of IT in problem-solving in the framework of lifelong learning.   The course uses a case study pedagogical approach to lead students through the solution of complex research problems that integrate 1) domain-specific knowledge and logic, 2) general scientific problem-solving strategies, 3) IT methods, and 4) the coordinated use of a number of IT tools.  This second level course, which goes beyond the typical first level IT course focusing on computer operation and use of tools, helps students to use IT to solve problems required by higher level discipline-specific courses.  \r\n\r\nThis project also contains the following teacher preparation components 1) preservice math and science teachers are being encouraged to take the proposed IT course, 2) teacher educators are part of the advisory board to help develop and assess the course,  and 3) the PI's are working with the local NSF Collaborative on Excellence in Teacher Preparation project to develop a specialized workshop for teacher educators and pre-service teachers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to implementing and evaluating a prototype course to a diverse population of students at Temple University, the project is developing the framework for creating such a course at any institution.   The framework delineates guidelines for 1) developing challenging discipline-specific case studies,  2) providing the foundation needed for embedding hands-on use of IT in different complex information rich environments, and 3) assessing the resulting course in the context of a particular curriculum.  \r\n\r\nDissemination of the framework and sample case studies is being accomplished by the involvement of faculty from other institutions on an advisory board, by the presentation of papers and workshops at national conferences, by the creation of an Internet repository and electronic discussion group of interested faculty, and by possible publication of a book containing the framework and a set of case studies. \r\n\r\n",
