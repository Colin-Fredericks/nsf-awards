 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant cell wall is modified in coordination with almost all\r\nplant developmental processes.  Changes in the cell wall are thought to be\r\nmediated by a family of enzymes that break down links in the structural\r\npolymers making up the cell wall, in particular links between glucose\r\nmolecules. The enzymes expected to modify cellulose, commonly referred to as\r\ncellulases, are members of this family.\r\n        In Arabidopsis  the family of cellulases is extensive (more than\r\ntwelve members) and is encoded by structurally different classes of genes.\r\nWithin the family there are members located at the plasma membrane that are\r\npresumed to act at the innermost layers of the cell wall, and members that\r\nare secreted and are presumed to act at any stratum within the cell wall,\r\nincluding the outermost layer.  Both structural groups have similar\r\ncatalytic signatures and homology to Family 9 of bacterial cellulases.\r\n        This project has the underlying hypothesis that cellulases anchored\r\nin the plasma membrane play a role in cell wall biosynthetic processes while\r\nthose that are extracellular play specific roles in cell wall catabolic\r\nprocesses that range in activity from partial and localized, to massive and\r\ncatastrophic.  This range in activity is linked to contrasting functions\r\nlike cell growth and cell death, respectively.  For all Arabidopsis\r\ncellulase genes nothing is known about their true in vivo substrate, mode of\r\naction and to what extent they can act on cellulose or other beta-1-4 glucans.\r\n        To better understand the role of cellulases in plant development,\r\ngenetic and molecular studies are proposed to investigate how gene\r\nexpression and enzyme levels are modulated during shifts between different\r\ncellulase functions for three structurally distinct Arabidopsis cellulase\r\ngenes:  a putative membrane-anchored cellulase Cel6.1.1,  a putative\r\nsecreted,  auxin-stimulated cellulase Cel5.1.1, and a putative abscission\r\ncellulase Cel115L.  The comparison is significant since it is believed that\r\nthe major cell wall changes occurring in processes of growth and expansion\r\ntake place in the innermost layer of the cell wall.  It is anticipated that\r\ncellulases involved in growth will be up-regulated during growth and\r\ndown-regulated during cell wall disassembly, and vice versa for cellulases\r\ninvolved in cell wall disassembly\r\n        The experimental system to be used for these studies is Arabidopsis\r\nhypocotyl growth in which contrasting functions of cellulase are manifested\r\nin different developmental stages of the same tissue. These functions\r\ninclude longitudinal and radial growth, cell separation and cell death.\r\nHypocotyl growth will be compared among wild-type plants, morphological\r\nmutants that are defective in lateral or longitudinal growth but are not\r\ndefective in cellulase genes and T-DNA insertional mutants (knock-out\r\nmutants) that are predicted to be defective in a particular cellulase gene.\r\nKnock-out mutations may change the shape or other characteristics of the\r\nplant consistent with the mutated genes hypothesized function and will\r\nprovide strong evidence for cellulase function.\r\n",
