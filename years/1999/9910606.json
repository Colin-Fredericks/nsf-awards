 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to use concepts from fractals to solve long-standing database problems in query optimization, spatial databases, and temporal databases. Moreover, it introduces the powerful tools of fractals, chaos and non-linear systems for additional applications, like forecasting, time-sequence data mining, buffering and prefetching, for large database applications. Typical questions can be as diverse as: \"In a real set of points, like cities of the world, estimate the average number of neighbors within 10 miles from New York city\" in a GIS (Geographic Information System) setting, and \"Given the history of past disk page requests, what can we forecast for future requests\" in a disk scheduling setting. Deriving estimated answers to such questions is notoriously hard, because of the non-uniformities that real datasets exhibit. Although unrealistic, the uniformity and independence assumptions have been traditionally used in past efforts, mainly because of their mathematical tractability and because of the lack of anything better. The current project proposes to replace them with the assumption of self-similarity, leading to much more accurate estimates. Current estimates with the uniformity assumption lead to up to 179 per cent error; with fractals, we expect the error to go down to 10 per cent or less. This will allow for more accurate selectivity estimations, yielding more realistic answers to queries and more successful query optimization, and better disk scheduling, improving the performance of database and disk systems.\r\nhttp://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos\r\n\r\n",
