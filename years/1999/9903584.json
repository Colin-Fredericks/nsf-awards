 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work of Steven G. Boxer, Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division. The research (i) will explore electro-optic properties of molecular vibrations, (ii) will examine synthetic donor-acceptor complexes based on metallocene-substituted polyenes to understand the relationships between electro-optic properties and non-linear optical parameters, (iii) will study weakly coupled mixed-valence systems to get information on electronic couplings, and (iv) will determine excited state electron and proton transfer dynamics using higher-order Stark spectroscopy to test an in-house developed theory and as a probe of dynamics in the solid state.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide significant fundamental information on the dynamics of electron transfer and proton transfer processes that are of interest in biologically related systems such as proteins and artificial photosynthetic species. The results of the work will also provide means to test newly developed theory to understand the relationships between electro-optic properties and non-linear optical parameters which will impact on the preparation of new electronic materials. Both graduate students and post-doctoral associates will gain valuable experience in cutting-edge and state-of-the-art research.",
