The conference will provide a forum for thoughts and ideas relative to understanding and implementation of the PSSM for PreK-2 students as well as ideas for instructional materials.  The conference will be co-sponsored by the EXXON Foundation.  It will be preceded by several months of planning.  Conference proceedings will be compiled as a way to disseminate the results of the conference.  Conference participants will include mathematicians, mathematics educators, early childhood educators, and others central to curriculum issues involving young people.  The conference will be limited to 100 participants. \r\n\r\n",
