 "awd_abstract_narration": "9908034\r\nCollins\r\nUpright stance in humans is regulated by a complex control system that involves a number of different sensory modalities, including the somatosensory system.  The goal of this project is to develop a bioengineering technique that can be used to enhance somatosensation in the feet and ankles of human subjects and thereby improve the performance of the human postural control system. \r\n\r\nRecently, there has been considerable interest in stochastic resonance (SR) which is a phenomenon wherein the response of a nonlinear system to a subthreshold input signal is optimized by the presence of a particular level of noise.  SR-type dynamics have been demonstrated in neuronal models, rat cutaneous sensory neurons, human muscle spindles and the human touch-sensation system.  These studies indicate that it is possible to introduce noise artificially into a sensory system in order to improve its ability to detect subthreshold signals. To date, however, bioengineering applications of SR-type dynamics have been limited. \r\n\r\nThis project will be directed towards developing a noise-based bioengineering technique for improving the function of the human postural control system.  Specifically, in this project, a non-invasive system for applying electrical noise to the feet and ankles of human subjects will be developed. This system will consist, in part of sock electrodes, which are made of conductive material. This system will be used in a series of psychophysical experiments that will be conducted on 25 healthy young subjects.  These experiments will be designed to test the hypothesis that dorsiflexion/plantarflexion detection thresholds in human subjects are changed with the addition of electrical noise. A series of quiet-standing experiments will also be conducted on the 25 subjects. These experiments will be designed to test the hypothesis that noise-induced changes to dorsiflexion/plantarflexion detection thresholds alter the quiet-standing dynamics of the postural control system. \r\n\r\nThis project could lead to the development of a non-invasive, noise-based technique that could be used to enhance somatosensation in humans and thereby improve the performance of the human postural control system. This work could have important ramifications for individuals with elevated somatosensory thresholds, such as older adults and patients with peripheral neuropathies. Such changes to the somatosensory system may predispose individuals to falls. Accordingly, the results of this project could eventually serve to reduce the frequency, cost, and morbidity of falling.\r\n",
