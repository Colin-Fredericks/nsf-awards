The US Principal Investigator is James T. Jenkins, Department of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, Cornell University.  The Tunisian organizer is Houcine Khatelli, Directeur General of the Institut des Regions Arrides in Medenine, Tunisia.  North African and US researchers will join with European colleagues in this workshop devoted to the aeloian transport of sand and the formation and migration of sand dunes.  Physicists, engineers, and geologists will discuss the application of recent advances in their respective fields to this important problem.  A significant part of the workshop will be devoted to field studies.  A goal of the workshop is to develop a network of US, European, and North African scientists committed to an understanding of desert processes.\r\n\r\nScope:  This project focuses on a problem of great importance to North African countries, namely the encroachment of the desert on cultivated or otherwise developed land.  The workshop will take place in Medenine in southern Tunisia at the Institute des Regions Arrides, where 200 people are working on the problem of desertification.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting international workshops that are likely to increase collaboration in areas of mutual interest.  This project is co-funded by INT and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.  \r\n",
