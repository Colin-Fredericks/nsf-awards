 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe process of RNA destabilization is known to be of equal importance to transcription in the regulation of gene expression.  In direct contrast to its pivotal role in gene expression, the biochemistry and developmental regulation of the biochemistry of destabilization is very poorly understood.  This lack of understanding is even greater for plants and even greater still for 5'-UTR (untranslated region) mediated destabilization.  Activation of the Blue High Fluence (BHF) system results in the destabilization of several specific transcripts including the PsLhcb1*4 and At Lhcb1*3 transcripts.  The response is not the result of stress, occurs rapidly, and does not require protein synthesis.  The destabilization element resides wholly in the 5'-UTR.  Previous studies in this investigator's laboratory have focused on defining the photobiology and phenomenology of the BHF-system mediated destabilization, which has provided a very solid base of data establishing and describing the destabilization response and its relation to other cellular, developmental and photobiological and clock processes including:\r\n\r\nThe BHF-system-destabilization element resides wholly within the respective 5'-UTR.\r\n\r\nThe destabilization mechanism may be similar, if not identical, to that responsible for stability and/or processing of rbcL and other chloroplast encoded transcripts.\r\n\r\nThe ability of the BHF system to function is developmentally regulated and represents a classic case of developmental competence.\r\n\r\nThe destabilization event triggered by excitation of the BHF system is also subject to regulation by the circadian clock.\r\n\r\nNPH1, the blue-light activated kinase that functions as the photoreceptor for phototropic curvature, is the photoreceptor for the BHF system.\r\n\r\nThe proposed experiments are designed to build upon these observations.  All of the proposed experiments will focus on the BHF system mediated destabilization.  None of the experiments requires development of new technology, and all can be initiated immediately or are already under way.  Four specific aims will be addressed:\r\n\r\nIdentification of the sequence elements and structures present in the PsLhcb1*4 5'-UTR responsible for BHF system mediated (and clock regulated) destabilization.\r\n\r\nSubcellular localization of the BHF system mediated destabilization event(s) in pea and in Arabidopsis.\r\n\r\nIdentification of RNA-binding and RNase activities associated with the BHF response.\r\n\r\nGenetic and molecular genetic testing of existing blue-light signaling mutants and genes for BHF system activity/NPH1 as a potential photoreceptor.\r\n",
