 "awd_abstract_narration": "Explosive growth in the wireless areas of cellular and digital personal communications services over the past few years has been shadowed by a decrease in the availability of trained workers.  Included in the trained workers needed are four-year graduates with electrical engineering, computer engineering, electronics/technician, or software/lprogramming degrees with a concentration in wireless technology. The mission of Global Wireless Education Consortium (GWEC (pronounced GeeWec) is to increase the quality and the quantity of technicians, engineers, and information technology specialists for the wireless industry.  GWEC is supported by industry members:  Motorola, Lucent Technologies, Ericsson, AT&T Wireless, Northern Telecom, Nokia, Movilnet, Midwest Wireless Communications, Telcordia Technologies, and AirTouch Communications.  Twenty-seven schools are GWEC Education Partners including eighteen four-year or Masters level programs.  GWEC initiatives apply to the CCLI themes of innovative educational materials addressing an enormous national and international need for well-prepared graduates with wireless knowledge.  This project includes: A)  Innovative materials for national distribution that have evaluated, tested and developed with industry and education experts. B)  Professional faculty development through tested and evaluated methods. C)  Teaching and learning strategies that have been integrated with practical application experiences providing students with theory and application. D)  Care to include minority programs and foster the growth of additional minority involvement.",
