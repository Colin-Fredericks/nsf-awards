 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proof of concept project to develop a web-based technical course with a laboratory component for the Manufacturing Engineering Technology Program. The course is also practical for presentation in an interactive television format. A team of faculty and the Project Director for the Southwest Center for Advanced Technological Education is developing the project and assisting a team of students in implementing the project plan. A manufacturing work cell is being installed with a video camera positioned to view the production of a part. Students can program the work cell from a computer at a distant site and view the production process on their personal computers. The instructor evaluates the part produced and the program used in the manufacturing process and provides feedback to each student. The technical course with the laboratory component is being tested at three pilot sites, evaluated by students and the faculty team. Results will be disseminated to community and technical colleges. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
