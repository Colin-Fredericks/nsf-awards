 "awd_abstract_narration": "Krainer   \r\nOn August 25 - 29, 1999, the second biannual \"Conference on Eukaryotic mRNA Processing\" will be held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. The conference focuses on  the mechanisms and regulation of splicing and 3'-end processing of mRNA in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Major advances have recently been made in these areas, and the conference will enable the community to discuss the latest unpublished results and exchange ideas, thereby fostering new developments in this rapidly moving field. The first meeting was held on August 20 - 24, 1997, and attracted an international group of 272 scientists who are actively investigating various aspects of mRNA maturation  using genetic, biochemical, molecular, and cellular approaches. As in the previous meeting, the major focus will be on nuclear events in mRNA maturation, particularly mRNA splicing and polyadenylation; the scope, however, will be slightly expanded to encompass nuclear mRNA editing. The meeting format will consist of seven plenary sessions and three poster sessions. Speakers in the plenary sessions will be selected on the basis of the submitted abstracts, a system that accommodates  active participation by more junior scientists. The main topics covered will include catalytic mechanisms and specificity of mRNA splicing and 3'-end processing; developmental and cell-type specific regulation of gene expression by alternative splicing and polyadenylation; structure and function of snRNP particles and of hnRNPs, SR proteins, PRPs, and other yeast, metazoan, and/or plant protein factors involved in splicing or polyadenylation; spliceosome assembly; nuclear mRNA editing; mRNA turnover; and localization and dynamics of processing reactions, factors, substrates, and products, in relation to nuclear architecture and to nuclear-cytoplasmic transport.\r\n\r\nMessenger RNA is a class of molecules absolutely essential to all living organisms.  The processing of mRNA in eukaryotic cells is a highly complex phenomenon involving a multitude of molecular players requiring intricate and precise regulation.  Understanding it is essential to helping human society through biology. This conference will enable the international research community studying the many aspects of this phenomenon to exchange their information, insights and ideas. \r\n\r\n",
