 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project of Professor James Haw of the University of Southern California, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, seeks to achieve a fundamental understanding of the catalytic reactions that occur on zeolites and metal oxides.  A special pulse quench catalytic reactor has been designed that allows the investigation of catalytic reactions by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.  Real time changes in catalytic kinetics can be followed with this device with a time resolution of 0.2 s.  Theoretical calculations are also used to model adsorption, reaction, and spectroscopic properties, and to model the experimental NMR results.  A specific example that will be studied in this project is the catalytic conversion of ethylene to toluene on an acidic zeolite surface.\r\n\r\nNuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry is used to study the catalytic transformation of simple adsorbed gases into more complex molecules on zeolite and metal oxide surfaces.   Professor James Haw at the University of Southern California has developed a sample introduction system that allows such catalytic systems to be studied as they change in real time, compared to previous methods that required that the reaction be stopped and evaluated piece by piece.  The new analytical method will be used to study the industrially important transformation of ethylene to toluene on an acidified zeolite surface.\r\n\r\n",
