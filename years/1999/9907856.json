 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this two-year pilot study is to determine if\r\nacquiring and mastering proficient language literacy will help young\r\nchildren of poverty develop and sustain resilience. Resilience is generally\r\ndefined as positive adaptation in the midst of and following trauma; the\r\nresilient child does not experience subsequent behavioral and emotional\r\nproblems.  The project is based on research that shows that some children\r\nwho live in adverse circumstances, such as poverty, and who have undergone\r\ntraumatic experiences have been identified as resilient despite their\r\nsusceptibility to the associated risks.  In addition, researchers have\r\nidentified specific cognitive and socioemotional characteristics and\r\nbehaviors that appear to be common among resilient children across\r\nsituations.  Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to determine if\r\nthere is a connection between language literacy proficiency and resilience\r\nin young children of poverty.  Approximately one hundred children will\r\nparticipate in the two year-year longitudinal study; they will be followed\r\nas first graders during Year1 and as second graders during Year2.\r\nClassroom teachers will incorporate into the regular curriculum a\r\nconcentrated, intense language literacy program through which the children\r\nwill receive enhanced literacy training.  The program will stress reading,\r\nvocabulary, writing, and higher-order thinking.  To evaluate the\r\neffectiveness of the program, the children will be assessed on cognitive\r\ncompetence and academic performance, social functioning, and home and\r\nfamily context.  Findings from the pilot study will be used to institute a\r\nlarger research project and to develop methods that school personnel can\r\nuse to help children become resilient.  Two major positions underly the\r\nproject:  (a) Resilience can be acquired, and (b) advanced literacy\r\nproficiency in the dominate mainstream language contributes to resilience\r\nin children of poverty.\r\n",
