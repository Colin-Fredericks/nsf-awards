 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to provide the scientific basis for more complete theories of collaboration and to develop mechanisms for constructing collaboration-capable software agents.  It is an inter-institutional collaborative research project of Harvard University and the University of Maryland.  The research focuses on problems of constructing agents able to manage their plans and intentions in multi-agent contexts and to make decisions in the context of team activities.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research comprises three activities:  empirical investigations of different policies governing commitment to group activities and their influence on individual and group behavior and outcomes; development of a formal theory that may be used to address abstractly questions of intention reconciliation and to identify stable strategies and effective policies for it; and construction of more sophisticated collaboration-capable software agents.  Four strands of previous research support this effort: specification of a\r\nformal model of collaboration, construction of prototype collaboration-capable systems, specification of models of negotiation, and development of a simulation framework for empirically investigating decision-making in the context of group activities.\r\n\r\nThe project contributes to fundamental research in collaboration, to the development of collaboration-capable software agents and collaborative human-computer interface systems, and to the training of undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n",
