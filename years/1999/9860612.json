 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860612\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of computer software that will simulate expensive drilling operations, especially deep land and ocean rotary drilling.  A finite element model will be used for real time simulation of the drilling process performed with roller cone bits.  The simulation will follow bit kinetics.  The rock fracturing process during drilling will be dynamically modeled.  The software will simulate drilling operation under a set of customer-defined working conditions such as rock formation, drill fluid, rotation rate, bit parameters, temperature, pressure, etc., and will generate predictions of drilling performance such as rate of penetration, power requirements, bit wear, and total drill bit productivity.  Computer graphics will enhance the presentation of the dynamic simulation, which is anticipated will help scientists and engineers gain a clear appreciation of drilling processes under way.\r\n     With the help of this computer simulation, engineers and scientists monitoring operations on drill rigs will drill more and faster for the same cost through parameter optimization; scientists may extract more information than before from the data obtained from drilling operations; and drill bit manufacturers will find much cheaper ways to evaluate and  improve their products.  Through computer stimulation the drilling industry may realize new savings in its operating costs because of better understanding of drilling operations. \r\n\t\r\n",
