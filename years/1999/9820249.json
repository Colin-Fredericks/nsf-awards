 "awd_abstract_narration": "9820249\r\nCotter\r\n\r\nTen women will be involved in field and laboratory research to determine the origin of glacial and postglacial deposits in west central Minnesota.  This includes the continuation of three closely related projects, which have in common the utilization of till analysis to determine the origin and glacial history of four problematic deposits.  U.M.M., an undergraduate institution, offers excellent facilities and close faculty contact.  R.E.U. women will have the opportunity to develop collegial ties with other undergraduates doing geologic research and to serve as mentors, instructors and role models to underrepresented high school students participating in college level research.  The research experience and the unique opportunity to interact with a scientific community where underrepresented individuals are in the majority will both break down a number of traditional barriers and aid in the maturation of these students as scientists.  The culmination to the program, the \"Friends of UMM REU\" conference, will provide these women with the opportunity to present results and discuss ideas with experts in the field.  Additionally a field trip to the Canadian Rockies will show participants active glacial processes and glacial environments.  The REU program will contribute to the personal growth of these women and the research to be accomplished will contribute to the understanding of the glacial history of Minnesota.\r\n",
