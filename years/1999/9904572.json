 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth of new brain cells after birth (postnatal neurogenesis)\r\noccurs in several brain areas of vertebrates.  Although previous studies\r\nhave shown that experience can influence brain growth, we do not know which\r\naspects of these experiences are involved with postnatal neurogenesis.  It\r\nis unclear whether experiences causes, or is caused by, postnatal\r\nneurogenesis and whether the mechanisms that regulate this growth are\r\nsimilar for different brain structures.  The objective of this research\r\nproposal is to test whether specific learning experiences can\r\ndifferentially promote neurogenesis in different regions of the brain.\r\nSnakes are ideal models for testing this hypothesis because they show\r\ncontinuous neurogenesis throughout their brains and can learn spatial tasks\r\nbased on different types of cues.  Cell proliferation and survival of brain\r\ncells are predicted to occur differentially in brain areas associated with\r\nspatial learning or chemosensory discrimination, depending on whether\r\nsnakes are trained to use spatial or chemosensory cues to solve a spatial\r\nescape task, respectively.  The brain areas that will be examined in snakes\r\nare also found in mammals and are thought to function in similar ways.\r\n\tThe results of the proposed study will determine if postnatal\r\nneurogenesis in specific brain structures is mediated by the use of\r\nspecific sensory cues to solve the same spatial problem.  These results\r\nshould give insight into the functionality of postnatal neurogenesis and\r\nhelp to form hypotheses about common mechanisms of spatial learning for\r\nvertebrates.  By comparing results from a variety of vertebrate species,\r\nthe long-term goal of this course of study is to understand the\r\nrelationship between behavioral plasticity and experience-dependent\r\nneurogenesis.  This information could have implications for understanding\r\nthe mechanisms which regulate brain growth and lead to new ways of\r\nstimulating brain growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
