The STM will be used to probe the local electronic structure of individual magnetic atoms and atomically fabricated magnetic nanostructures on clean, well-characterized metal surfaces. STM spectroscopy will probe the interaction between conduction electrons interact and the localized d-levels of transition metal adsorbates. Such interactions determine the magnetism of individual impurity atoms, and also lead to cooperative electronic behavior, as seen in the Kondo effect. Trends in electronic behavior will be studied for different adsorbate atoms from the 3d, 4d, and 5d rows of the periodic table. The effects of temperature variation and an applied magnetic field will be investigated. Atomic manipulation will be used to vary the spacing between magnetic adsorbate atoms and also to assemble magnetic nanostructures atom by atom. Efforts will also be made to use inelastic tunneling spectroscopy as a probe of the magnetic excitation spectra of artificially fabricated nanostructures. The work will provide an experimental test of several theoretical predictions concerning magnetic nanostructures. The research provides excellent training for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students in areas of both fundamental and technological significance. The manipulation of individual atoms is one of the current frontiers in materials science. \r\n%%%\r\nThe purpose of this Condensed Matter Physics project is to gain a better understanding of the behavior of magnetic nanostructures at surfaces. Magnetic surface and interface phenomena currently have important applications in the data storage industry, and an increased understanding of microscopic magnetic behavior should impact this and other applications. The research will study the properties of magnetic nanostructures using an ultra-high vacuum cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope (STM). This instrument will be used to probe the local electronic structure of individual magnetic atoms and atomically fabricated magnetic nanostructures on clean, well-characterized metal surfaces. Atomic manipulation will be used to vary the spacing between magnetic adsorbate atoms and also to assemble magnetic nanostructures atom by atom. Atomic manipulation allows a fundamentally new way of controllably measuring interaction effects between magnetic atoms, and promises to open a new regime in the experimental study of atomic-scale magnetic objects. Efforts will also be made to use inelastic tunneling spectroscopy as a probe of the magnetic excitation spectra of artificially fabricated nanostructures. The fundamental knowledge gained from this project should provide a useful step toward the goal of controlling the electronic and magnetic properties of condensed matter systems at the nanometer lengthscale. Results from this study should also be helpful in understanding larger-scale systems whose properties depend on constituent nanostructures (such as granular magnetic materials). The research provides excellent training for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students in areas of both fundamental and technological significance. The manipulation of individual atoms is one of the current frontiers in materials science. \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
