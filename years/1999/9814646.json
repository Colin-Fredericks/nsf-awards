There will be two versions.  The first will be a 4,500 sq.-ft. exhibit that will include about 35 life science interactive modules and will be installed at the Exploratorium.  Following an evaluation period, about 20 of the exhibits will be used for a 3,000 sq.-ft. traveling version of the exhibition.  The Association of Science and Technology Centers will manage the circulation of the exhibition.  Challenging visitors to consider the question \"What is Life?\" this exhibition will be designed to offer learners new ways to explore characteristics shared by all living things.  Three traits have been selected to illustrate the characteristics common to all living things:  a shared molecular and cellular structure, self-reproduction, and adaptation to surroundings.  These traits will be reflected in three sections of the exhibit:  \"A Common Design\", \"Passing It On\" and \"Staying Alive\".  Complementary elements include artists-in-residence, scientists-in-residence, teacher institutes, student materials, web-based activities, public programs and publications.  Project staff will attempt to develop an understanding of techniques that are most successful in stimulating learning about life science in informal settings.\r\n",
