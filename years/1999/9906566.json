 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the chemistry of organic compounds of sulfur and selenium.  Broad studies of the chemical and physical properties of a variety of S- and Se-heterocycles will be carried out.  Specific methodological studies include those directed toward the development of polyfunctional sulfonylethenes for use as cumulene equivalents in Diels-Alder reactions.  Several interesting natural products are targeted for total synthesis to explore issues surrounding the manipulation of compounds containing multiple sulfur-based functional groups.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support for the research of Professor Eric Block of the State University of New York at Albany.  Professor Block explores the chemistry of organic molecules containing sulfur and selenium atoms.  Such molecules can be used to modify the structures of other organic compounds and are also found in nature.  Further study of novel forms of these molecules will uncover new and useful reactions and reagents.  Several naturally occuring compounds will be synthesized in order to learn more about how to carry out reactions on molecules that may have more than one sulfur atom.\r\n\r\n",
