 "awd_abstract_narration": "Established in 1899, the Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS) is a Center of Excellence in The University of Montana system.  The FLBS has three resident faculty, a 15-member permanent staff and an annual budget of $1 M.  FLBS is located on the East Shore of Flathead Lake, some 90 miles north of Missoula, Montana, within a remarkable area of the Rocky Mountains known as the Crown of the Continent.  The FLBS mission is to  conduct basic research in ecology, train quality graduate students for professions in environmental disciplines and provide scientific data and information to the professional and general public in the form of electronic data bases, white papers, short courses, workshops and forums.\r\n\r\nThe FLBS research program is organized around specific hypotheses concerning natural and social aspects of ecosystem function and involves 25 collaborators.  There are four long -term core projects: 1) biodiversity and bioproduction along biophysical gradients; 2) floodplain ecology and river restoration; 3) large lake limnology; and, 4) environmental change assessment and ecosystem modeling.  These projects have produced > 100 juried papers over the last five years and substantially elevated (>50%) research funding and use of our facilities by new staff, graduate students and visiting scientists.  Moreover, researchers increasingly rely on high volume data bases for spatial analysis of ecosystem processes, which has caused a pressing need for specific items of equipment.\r\n\r\nThis project will assist in the acquisition of: 1) a total organic carbon analyzer, 2) hardware for a new spatial analysis lab, 3) an image analysis system for optical measurements (e.g., invertebrates, zooplankton, micro-organisms and organelles); and, 4) a local area network server with a high volume back-up device.  These items are central to growth of collaborative research and essential for management and distribution of the massive electronic data bases rapidly accumulating at FLBS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
