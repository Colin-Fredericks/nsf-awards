These problems are associated with stochastic \r\nadaptive control which is the control of an incompletely known \r\nstochastic system.  Typically to solve an adaptive control problem \r\nit is necessary to identify the unknown parameter of the system and \r\nsimultaneously to construct a control.  The cost functionals for the \r\ncontrol problems are typically ergodic (average cost per unit time).  \r\nA family of processes, fractional Brownian motion, is proposed for \r\ndevelopment by extending a stochastic calculus and using these \r\nprocesses for adaptive control problems.  This family of processes \r\nseems to have wide applicability.  Adaptive control for stochastic \r\ndistributed parameter systems is proposed by considering partially \r\nknown semilinear systems.  This family of systems includes some \r\nstochastic partial differential equations.  The adaptive control of \r\ncontinuous time branching processes is proposed for investigation \r\nbecause these processes are important and little use of control has \r\nbeen made for these processes.  Risk sensitive control problems are \r\nespecially useful for financial models.  It is proposed to study \r\nadaptive control for these problems.  The work in this proposal \r\nshould be applicable to physical systems that have stochastic \r\nmodels that are controlled.  It should enhance the understanding of \r\nthese physical systems.\r\n\r\nMathematical models are used to describe physical systems and \r\nanalysis is performed on these mathematical models.  Typically it \r\nis required to control the physical systems so that control is \r\nintroduced in the mathematical models.  Usually the models are not \r\ncompletely specified so it is necessary to identify some parameters \r\nof the model from the evolution of the system.  To describe \r\nperturbations or unmodelled dynamics in a system, noise is \r\nintroduced in the model.  The control of an incompletely specified \r\nsystem with noise is called stochastic adaptive control.  It is \r\nproposed to investigate a wide variety of problems in stochastic \r\nadaptive control.  These problems include lumped and distributed \r\nsystems.  Some new noise models using fractional Brownian \r\nmotion will also be investigated.\r\n",
