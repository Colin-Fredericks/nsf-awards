 "awd_abstract_narration": "The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) proposes to significantly advance the science, mathematics, and technology education (SMT) of all K-12 students through the San Francisco Urban Systemic Program (SFUSP).  The SFUSP accomplishes this task by building on the extant infrastructure that serves as the foundation for the District's Urban Systemic Program (USP) implementation plan.  This infrastructure is characterized by an exemplary leadership team, content standards for science and mathematics based on the State's Curricula Framework entitled Educational Standards for Science and Mathematics, a comprehensive accountability plan, policies in support of SMT education for all, the convergence of fiscal and intellectual resources for a single K-12 program for SMT, and a shared vision among all sectors of the broader community in support of the teaching and learning of science and mathematics, system-wide.  \r\n\r\nTo accomplish the USP goals, the SFUSD provides all of its students with the fundamentals of mathematics and science so that their understanding, ability, and academic achievement enable them to perform at or above their peers from around the world.  The SFUSD goals are: (1) to increase the science, mathematics, and technological knowledge of teachers; (2) to develop an effective pedagogy; (3) to support a coherent and cohesive curriculum and assessment system in which technology is appropriately integrated; and (4) to increase the number of students who will meet the system's more rigorous graduation requirements.\r\n\r\nThe infrastructure was developed over a 14-year period guided by a shared vision for reform at the District level.  Significant external fiscal and intellectual resources from business and industry, national foundations and educational agencies, NSF and other federal entities were integrated to support key elements of the foundation.  The well-defined implementation plan advance to full scale the district's capacity to provide a standards-based science, mathematics, and technology education for all students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
