 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and associates develop large scale\r\ncomputational procedures for optimal stochastic control problems.\r\nMassively parallel processor and parallel algorithm advances are\r\nessential for managing massive computational and memory demands,\r\nwith particular emphasis on large scale applications in ground\r\nwater pollution remediation and manufacturing systems.\r\nImplementation of advanced computational techniques, such as\r\nparallelization, graphical visualization, and efficient data\r\nstructures make possible the solution of larger dimensional\r\nproblems.  The emphasis here is on formally justified and useful\r\ncomputational methods rather than limited highly rigorous\r\nresults.  The objective is to develop fast algorithms coupled\r\nwith massively parallel processing for the optimal feedback\r\ncontrol of general continuous-time nonlinear stochastic dynamical\r\nsystems.  These stochastic systems include both Gaussian and\r\ndistributed Poisson white noise, thus hybrid stochastic models.\r\nAdvanced computational treatment of these systems, especially\r\nwith Poisson noise for modeling disastrous events, is a\r\nparticularly unique feature of this research.  The computational\r\nmethods are tested on ground water pollution models and\r\nmultistage manufacturing systems, but are applicable to a wide\r\nvariety of applications, yielding a higher level of robustness\r\nfor the computational methods.  The numerical approach directly\r\ntreats the partial differential equation of stochastic dynamic\r\nprogramming.  New algorithms, including finite element and random\r\nsimulations, are developed to alleviate both memory and\r\ncomputationally intensive demands from the \"curse of\r\ndimensionality.\"\r\n     The investigator and associates develop optimal\r\ncomputational solutions to ground water pollution and\r\nmanufacturing problems perturbed by uncertainty.  Ground water\r\nand manufacturing problems are examples of grand and national\r\nchallenge problems, respectively.  In the case of ground water\r\nthe cause of uncertainty is the unexpected introduction of\r\npollution and varying environmental parameters, while in the case\r\nof the manufacturing systems it is the failure and repair of\r\nmachines with fluctuating manufacturing parameters.  The reason\r\nfor seeking optimal solutions is to minimize costs.  Large scale\r\ncomputations are necessary due to the complexity of the governing\r\nphysical equations and essential numerical approximations.  Since\r\nthe cleanup of polluted ground water sites can cost billions\r\nwhere feasible, optimal solutions could save millions over\r\nnonoptimal methods.  Similar savings can be obtained for\r\njust-in-time manufacturing systems that are managed to minimize\r\ncosts, enhancing our globally competitive capabilities.  Advanced\r\ncomputing techniques are developed to get optimal solutions using\r\nhigh performance computation with massively parallel computers.\r\nGraphical visualization is important to make the immense output\r\nusable to the environmental resource or manufacturing plant\r\nmanager who would be the prime user.",
