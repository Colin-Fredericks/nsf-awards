 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) enables that organization to recruit approximately 100 Native American and Latino undergraduate and graduate students from the non-biomedical sciences to participate in the 1999 SACNAS National Conference to be held in Portland, OR on October 7-10, 1999.  At the conference, these students will present results of research activities in which they have been involved and also attend mentoring sessions designed to assist them in planning for subsequent educational and employment pursuits.  Additionally, a day-long session is planned in which NSF staff will describe opportunities for Foundation support of research and education activities.\r\n\r\nHistorically, SACNAS national conferences have focussed on students with biomedical backgrounds and interests, primarily because financial support for these conferences has been provided largely by the National Institutes of Health.  In FY 1998, NSF provided support to SACNAS to broaden the disciplinary perspective of the conference to include those disciplines that are reflected in the investment portfolios of NSF.  This renewal award provides support to continue that broadening process.  Short-term goals of this activity include a marked increase in the number of SACNAS conference student attendees with interests in the non-biomedical sciences and engineering.  In the longer term, increases in Latino and Native Americans in NSF-relevant science and engineering activities are expected. \r\n\r\nThis award is jointly supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences; Computer and Information Science and Engineering; Education and Human Resources; Geosciences; Mathematical and Physical Sciences; Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; and the NSF Office of Integrative Activities.\r\n",
