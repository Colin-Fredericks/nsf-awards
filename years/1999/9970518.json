These include: analytic (Hilbert and Frechet) submodules and quotient modules of the Bergman space over a (smoothly bounded) pseudoconvex domain in n-dimensional complex space; the spectral picture and C*-algebraic properties (such as essential normality and type oneness) of the n-tuples induced on modules of this type by bounded holomorphic mappings of such domains that are smooth up to the boundary; the smoothness of the corresponding induced extensions; Toeplitz C*-algebras over pseudoconvex domains with nonabelian transverse symmetries (such as generalized Reinhardt domains), the calculation of the K-theory of such C*-algebras, and the relationship between the smooth KK-theory and smooth relative quasidiagonality. He also intends to consider a new geometric phenomenon; namely, points of infinite curvature in the \"numerical range\" of a given operator T that produce points in the generalized representation spectrum of T. Salinas also plans to investigate the smoothness of certain operators of second order on smoothly bounded pseudoconvex domains where the Bergman projection is not globally regular.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to explore and to exploit the important interplay between two rich and time-honored areas of mathematics, operator theory and the theory of functions of several complex variables. A newly emerging focal point of mathematical interdisciplinary activity, this area is brimming with excitement. From a purely mathematical point of view, it was naturally advantageous to foster the cross-pollination because it would increase the number of tools that operator theorists and complex analysts alike have to attack fundamental problems in their respective subdisciplines, but the success of the marriage has exceeded all expectations. From a more practical and concrete vantage point, the combination of the two fields is significant because of the expanded potential it offers for applications to both theoretical and experimental physics, as well as to engineering. For example, operator theory and the theory of several complex variables have already been used successfully in control theory as a crucial part of the development of the software that automatically lands the space shuttle. The activities of Salinas aimed at creating alternative teaching methods for use by blind instructors and his continuing role in the evolution of scientific 8-dot Braille add value to the project in the area of human resource development.\r\n",
