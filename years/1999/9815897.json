The infrastructure and services built around the Unidata sytem and tools in DAS has allowed UI to make an umber of important advances in teaching, research, and outreacth efforts.  The data received via IDD and the concomitant analysis and display software are used in a number of undergraduate and graduate courses.  The use of locally-developed web-based tools, built around Unidata systems, in the classroom  has had a  significant impact on our teaching and student enrollment.  Because of extensive use in teaching, rsearch and outreach, Unidata systems are a highly valued resource within the department.  While the volume of data received in the department, the capabilities provided by Unidata packages and the uses of those data and software are constantly growing, the computers behind those tasks have not kept pace with the increaseing demand, and are unable to handle the myriad of tasks for which they are used.  The limitation posed by thes aging computers is serioulsy hindering our plans to enhance our educational and research programs in the department.  Therefore, replacement equipment is requested to continue to provide the level of access to students and to the Unidata community. \r\n",
