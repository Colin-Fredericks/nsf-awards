More precisely, in the first part of the proposal,\r\nmotivated by the prominent role of the second variation theory\r\nfor geodesics in classical Riemannian geometry together with\r\nmodern minimal surface techniques, the investigator proposes\r\nmethods for understanding the second variation theory for the\r\nfree boundary problem for minimal disks together with its\r\ngeometric implications. In the second part, the investigator\r\nproposes projects applying minimal surface theory to study the\r\ntopological structure of manifolds with positive isotropic\r\ncurvature.\r\n\r\nThis proposal deals with certain two dimensional variational\r\nproblems which arise from a geometric setting. For example, the\r\nfirst part deals with the problem of extremizing the area for\r\nmappings from the disk into a manifold subject to a boundary\r\nconstraint. In case the manifold is the three dimensional\r\nEuclidean space, we are constructing mathematical ``soap films''\r\nmeeting a constraint surface orthogonally. Free boundary problems\r\narise naturally in material science, for example in fluid\r\ninterface problems, and in elasticity problems. Objects which are\r\ncritical points for a geometric variational problem can\r\nfrequently be shown to satisfy very special properties. The basic\r\ngoal is to use such information to derive properties of the\r\ngeneral geometric class under consideration.  The results of this\r\nproject are aimed at advancing our understanding of fundamental\r\nrelationships between the curvature and topology of manifolds\r\n",
