 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the efficient generation of robust, optimal plans for recursively decomposing geometric constraint systems into subsystems whose solutions can be recombined. Primary consideration is given to constraint systems that arise within the context of interactive design and assembly for CAD/CAM. \r\nDecomposing a geometric constraint system is a critical and longstanding issue, since the overwhelming \r\ncost in solving the system is dictated by - and exponential in - the size of the largest subsystem that is \r\nsolved by a general algebraic/numeric solver directly, i.e, without further decomposition. Moreover, \r\na truly interactive CAD environment allows the constraint model to interact with the designer as well as with downstream production software throughout the design process. Hence a hierarchical structural decomposition of the constraint system plays a key role in capturing design intent. Due to the lack of efficient and robust decomposition techniques, there are currently no effective, spatial variational \r\nconstraint solvers, and assembly solvers are seriously limited. This inadequacy severely hinders the development of intelligent, interactive CAD systems.\r\n\r\nPreliminary results provide a strong foundation for this project. More specifically: 1) We have isolated and precisely formalized the optimal decomposition-recombination ( DR) planning problem as well as several new performance measures that reflect the various desirable characteristics of DR plans and planners \r\nspecifically for CAD/CAM. The precise formalization of the DR-problem as well as the new performance measures are of independent interest and have the potential to be widely used by the constraint solving \r\nand CAD communities. 2) We have developed the building blocks of a new DR planner, called the Modified Frontier Algorithm (MFA), which significantly improves on existing methods both in terms of several of the new performance measures, as well as in preliminary implementations.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the project is to develop and implement a fully-fledged prototype of a DR-planner along with the required interfaces built around the MFA backbone, which performs well with respect to all of the new performance measures. In addition, the prototype implementation will be incorporated into the Erep system and then evaluated by comparison with existing constraint solvers, sketchers and CAD systems.\r\n\r\nSpecific research tasks are directed towards ensuring that the new DR planner possesses various capabilities such as: 1)  ability to deal with nongeometric constraints, particularly equational and parametric constraints which reflect design intent; 2)  ability to incorporate a multilayered conceptual decomposition \r\nspecified by the designer, and robustness and adaptability to interactive changes made to the constraint system; 3)  optimal complexity, and guaranteed approximation factor of the near-optimal, output DR-plan; \r\n4) ability to maintain consistency of the CAD constraint model view with multiple, possibly proprietary, downstream application views of the product master model; and 5) modularity of the implementation, compatibility with existing algebraic/numeric solvers, and incorporability into existing CAD systems.\r\n\r\n",
