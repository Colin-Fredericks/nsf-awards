 "awd_abstract_narration": "9973300\r\nWebber\r\n\r\nThis project is a unified theoretical and experimental study of the adsorption of polymer micelles at surfaces.  The polymer micelle exterior is made up of polyacids which can respond to changes in solution pH and/or ionic strength.  It has been found that these two parameters control the density of polymer micelle attachment to an aminated surface, but the exact mechanism for this control is not understood.  Experimental aspects of the project will include (1) synthesis of various block copolymers by anionic polymerization, with control of the lengths of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks; (2) preparation and characterization of micelles formed by these copolymers; (3) attachment of these micelles to aminated or other modified surfaces under various pH and ionic strength conditions and characterization of the surfaces.  Theoretical aspects of the project will extend the current understanding of polyelectrolyte brushes and the competition between chain distortion and energetically favorable acid-base interactions.  Advances in theory will be used to help guide experiment and the results of experiment and the results of experiment will be used to test the predictions of theory.\r\n\r\nBesides the intrinsic interest in these novel structures, the project may lead to valuable advance the fields of, control of cell adhesion to surfaces, drug delivery, chemical sensing, and optical data storage.\r\n",
