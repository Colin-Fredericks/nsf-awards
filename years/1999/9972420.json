 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are developing educational materials to bring modern content into\r\nintroductory physics. With the aid of previous NSF funding we have created\r\na new calculus-based introductory textbook on mechanics and thermal physics\r\nthat addresses the following problems: 1) Many students have already\r\nstudied mechanics in high school and are bored by repeating nearly the same\r\nmaterial in college. 2) Students and instructors are unhappy with the lack\r\nof contemporary science in the traditional course. 3) Students in the\r\ntraditional course are not involved in the modeling of physical systems,\r\nincluding making idealizations, approximations and simplifying assumptions.\r\n4) Thermodynamics and mechanics are traditionally treated as completely\r\nseparate topics, rather than as an integrated science based on a small\r\nnumber of fundamental principles. The new curriculum emphasizes\r\natomic-level description and analysis, and physical modeling including\r\ncomputer modeling. The material deliberately looks to the students very\r\ndifferent from what they had studied earlier. Thermal physics is integrated\r\nwith mechanics throughout the textbook, climaxing with an accessible\r\nstatistical mechanical treatment of the Einstein solid.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the new textbook provides a needed alternative to\r\ntraditional texts, but it is not yet pedagogically robust and\r\ntransportable. It already works well with exceptionally strong students;\r\nthis is important because such students are at special risk of boredom, and\r\nwe do not want to lose them. However, we would like to make this\r\ninteresting subject matter accessible not just to the honors student but\r\nalso to the average student who has had a decent high school physics\r\npreparation. It is also important to make the curriculum teachable by other\r\ninstructors; this requires the creation of additional kinds of materials,\r\nincluding an instructor's manual and support packages for introducing\r\ncomputer modeling into the course.\r\n\r\nWe propose to continue work on pedagogical aspects of the reform, with\r\nfurther revisions of the textbook in response to our teaching experiences\r\nand ongoing formative assessment activities. A key component will be a\r\nnational beta test in Fall 1999 for which we are currently recruiting\r\nparticipants. We believe that we now have something well worth teaching but\r\nwe need to address shortcomings in how well we and others can teach it. We\r\nalso propose to revise and extend our earlier E&M textbook to match the new\r\nmaterial, thus providing a coherent, modern one-year introductory physics\r\ntextbook. We propose to engage in additional evaluation and dissemination\r\nactivities.\r\n",
