 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fast hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms in the energy range 1-100 eV and higher are produced in the earth's upper atmosphere through a variety of processes.  Such fast ground-state hydrogen (Hf) and oxygen (Of) atoms will be generated in the laboratory energy range 2-100 eV using a unique experimental facility at JPL.  The fast atoms will then be used to study two classes of atmospheric reactions with the important species N2, O2, and NO.  These reaction classes are (a) electron-capture and stripping, where cross-section and mass-charge ration measurements are made using a Penning ion trap, and (b) infrared (vibrational) excitation and emission, where cross sections are measured using an integrating sphere coupled to a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer.\r\n\r\nThe work proposed herein represents a unique combination of facilities and capital items.  The fast-atom source generates the fast ground-state Hf and Of atoms by forming their respective negative ions, accelerating to the desired final energy, and laser-detaching the electron to leave a fast neutral species in its ground atomic state.  The facility was developed under Air Force funding, the Penning trap for use in (a) was developed under NASA funding, and the FTIR spectrometer to be used in (b) was purchased under Air Force funding.  The facility is the only one of its kind capable of generating the ground-state atoms and making measurements in this difficult 2-100 eV neutral energy range. \r\n",
