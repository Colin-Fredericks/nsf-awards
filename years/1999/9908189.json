 "awd_abstract_narration": "9908189\r\nPrakash\r\nA study of friction under extreme conditions of load and sliding velocity will be undertaken.  This is relevant to a number of technologically important situations, such as at tool-workpiece interfaces during ultra-high speed machining, friction and explosive welding processes, rotating band of an accelerating shell in a gun barrel, interfaces of bodies during high velocity impact, rocket driven vehicles on rails, and high performance brake liners employed in automobiles and aircrafts.  The conditions are such that the temperature at the interface approaches the melt regime of the lower melting point material in the tribo-pair. Recent developments in experimental methods to investigate high speed friction have enabled measurement in this region, at applied normal pressures ranging from 3 to 5 GPa and slip speeds of over 150 m/s. \r\n\t\r\nThe proposed study will involve, (i) high impact velocity pressure-shear plate-impact friction experiments on relatively low melting point metals such as aluminum, (ii) detailed transient finite deformation elastic-visco-plastic finite element modeling of the impact friction process-in order to understand the continuum level predictions of the extent of elastic-plastic interactions of the tribo-pair materials, and (iii) detailed optical, electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and flourescence (EDS) studies to understand the tribo-mechanical and tribo-chemical interactions during the sliding process.\r\n*** \r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
