 "awd_abstract_narration": "A common vision for a second level of national networking infrastructure is beginning to emerge.  This layer of services, among other things, is likely to incorporate support for users to securely and effectively access network-based resources at remote sites.  Before that can happen, however, the set of involved campuses will need to confront the issue of determining what the core set of interoperable middleware services needs to be. Perhaps more difficult is the related activity of defining campus policy to be enforced through the services. These services and the policies they enforce will need to permeate campus infrastructures, systems, and services.  This award provides funding to permit a set of \"study\" institutions to attack these problems by evaluating best practices for policy definition and deployment and then to create a plan for a multi-institution experiment in the instantiation and use of needed core services.  Results will help to inform NSF and others regarding programs designed to stimulate the emergence of this new logical network infrastructure.",
