 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides practical training in medical imaging instrumentation, data acquisition, and image formation in the modalities of positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The principal investigator (PI) will obtain this training by spending a sabbatical year in the Department of Radiology at Emory University School of Medicine.  The training provided will equip the PI with new research tools and information that will lead to new mathematical models and algorithms for image formation, enhancement, and analysis.   Of particular importance is the development of correct models for errors in data obtained in a clinical setting from these modalities.   In addition to the training received, this grant will result in the formation of large databases of data obtained from real PET,  SPECT, and  MRI machines.  This data will be taken to the PI's home institution and used to analyze various methods of image reconstruction, and enhancement. New mathematics courses and  \r\n educational materials in medical imaging will also be developed.  Furthermore, the research capabilities of the PI will be expanded to include collaboration  with radiologists on practical problems they face in these imaging modalities.   This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
