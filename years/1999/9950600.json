 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this proposal is to create a computer-based classroom that extends beyond the four walls of its physical setting, thus allowing both our traditional students and our rather large population of nontraditional students to experience the various reform efforts that have transformed mathematics over the past decade. In particular, we propose to establish a computer-based classroom that would be utilized for lecture, demonstration and tutoring in the sense of traditional technology-based classrooms. In addition, we propose to network the classroom through a dedicated web server allowing access to and participation in the laboratory environment from remote locations. As a result, students will have the ability to begin assignments in the classroom while on campus, and then they will be able to complete those assignments from any computer with access to the Internet after they have departed campus.  The project is adapting for this setting the text \"Multivariable Calculus\" by McCallum, Hughes-Hallet, Gleason, et.al. \r\n\r\nAlthough the classroom will be available to all courses taught by the mathematics department, we are targeting this proposal at our courses in multivariable calculus, numerical analysis and numerical linear algebra. These are the courses that stand to benefit the most from a computer-based classroom which is also accessible via the Internet. Each semester we have several continuing-education students in these courses who live and work in either Kingsport, Bristol or Greeneville, which range from 25 to 30 miles from the main campus. Requiring these students to return to campus daily, as would be the case with a conventional computer-based classroom, is not an option. Thus, we propose to teach these courses in a computer-based classroom with a physical presence for instruction and tutoring, and an on-line presence for outside assignments and projects.  \r\n",
