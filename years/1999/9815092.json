The PI proposes the development of improved direct algorithms based on a holographic approach for analyzing electron diffraction experimental results.  Collaboration with experimental efforts are planned involving photoelectron holography, low energy electron diffraction, and reflection and transmission high energy electron diffraction with researchers from Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the University of Erlangen-Nuernberg.  Additional work is planned in the development of direct algorithms for surface xray diffraction to determine the entire three-dimensional charge density of the surface layers, collaborating with experimental work at the University of Munich.\r\n%%%\r\nMuch like optical holography can generate three-dimensional images of objects, electron beams scattered from surfaces can be used to generate holographic images of atoms and their accompanying electron charge densities at the surfaces of materials.  The object of this research proposal is to develop better mathematical algorithms for decoding experimental data into such images, and collaborative work with experimentalists using a variety of electron scattering techniques is planned.  These methods are important for basic research, but are particularly important for surface-critical applications ranging from catalysis to corrosion.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
