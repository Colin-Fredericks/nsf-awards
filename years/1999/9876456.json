A theory \r\nof the structure of words and of their relations to one another, developed in \r\nprevious research by the PI, has as one important component the claim that \r\nclitics serve a function within the phrase which is closely parallel to that \r\nfilled by affixes (and other morphological markers) within words. This \r\nresearch develops and explores the consequences of that observation.\r\n\r\nClitic systems may involve the interaction of many areas of grammar, as in \r\nTagalog, where independent principles of syntax, phonology, and phrasal \r\nmorphology combine to yield an intricate set of patterns. This research will \r\nenrich our understanding of a number of areas of linguistic structure \r\n(phonology, morphology and syntax) and their inter-relation, as well as \r\nrefinements in a range of current linguistic theories. As a by-product of \r\nresearch into these theoretical questions, the project will also result in \r\ndescriptive studies of languages with rich but poorly documented systems of \r\nclitics, such as Kurdish and Breton.\r\n\r\n",
