 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant would enable the annual International Conference on Cognitive and Neural Systems to continue on May 24-27, 2000 and in May, 2001.  The conference focuses on the two general themes:  How Does the Brain Control Behavior?  and How Can Technology Enable Biological Intelligence?  The conference would also emphasize Learning and Intelligent Systems.  Many conferences are covering cognitive or neurobiological data.  A few conferences are covering cognitive or neurological models, but not both.  Yet other conferences are covering artificial neural networks and other neuromorphic applications .  The Cognitive and Neural Systems conference is unique in covering both cognitive and neural experiments and models, as well as a range of intelligent applications, and doing so within a conference program with a single program track.  The meeting was prepared to do this because this is precisely what the CNS graduate program at Boston Universitiy was created to do.  The conference will include invited tutorials and lectures, and contributed lectures and posters by experts on the biology and technology of how the brain and other intelligent systems adapt to a changing world.  The conference is aimed at researchers and students of computational neuroscience, connectionists cognitive science, artificial neural networks, neuromorphic engineering, and artificial intelligence.",
