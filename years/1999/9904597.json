 "awd_abstract_narration": "9904597\r\nBell\r\nSecretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is an enzyme that binds to and hydrolyzes the phospholipids of susceptible biological membranes.  In the normal state, most cell membranes are resistant to hydrolysis by this enzyme; however, they become susceptible under specific conditions such as elevated intracellular calcium.  Although significant information on the mechanism of action of this enzyme has been learned from studies with artificial membranes, there is little data addressing the degree to which the principles identified in these artificial systems applies to biological membranes.  This study uses human erythrocytes as a biological model to test this applicability.  The specific factors that appear to govern membrane susceptibility to PLA2 are membrane surface charge, membrane curvature, and the presence of microdomains in the bilayer.  The relationship between these factors and PLA2 binding and hydrolytic activity is examined in both intact cells and a systematic series of erythrocyte membrane preparations containing various permutations of these properties.   These objectives are achieved using a variety of biophysical and biochemical techniques including fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy, electron microscopy, electrophoresis, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and thin-layer chromatography.  The overall goal is to identify what physical properties of biological membranes determine the level of susceptibility of those membranes to PLA2. \r\n\r\nMuch is known about the mechanisms of action and regulation of soluble proteins.  Achieving an equivalent understanding of proteins that interact with membrane surfaces is currently an area of emphasis in biochemistry.  So far, much of the research into the structure, function, and biophysics of such proteins has been limited to the use of artificial membranes. However, such studies are sometimes criticized because of concern regarding their applicability to biological systems.  Phospholipase A2 is an example of an enzyme that binds to cell membranes and is regulated by the structure of the membrane which depends on the physiological condition of the cell.  The biochemical and biophysical basis of PLA2 action has been well-studied previously with artificial membranes.  In this investigation, those studies will now be extended to focus on biological membranes from human red blood cells.  This work can lead to an understanding of how the physical properties of cell membranes regulate the activity of an enzyme bound to their surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
