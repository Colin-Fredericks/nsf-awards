 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Kevin Smith, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Davis, is studying the synthesis and chemistry of chlorophylls and related compounds.  Professor Smith's studies are focused on the synthesis and structure of nonplanar porphyrins, calixarenoporphyrins, sensitizers for photodynamic therapy, conformationally-locked phytochrome chromophores, aromatic-fused porphyrin systems, and porphyrin-metallocene systems, as well as on the Diels-Alder chemistry of porphyrin and phthalocyanine-based systems.\r\n\r\nPorphyrins and chlorophylls are vital catalysts and agents in life processes, and an increased understanding of their chemistry and biology remains an important objective.  Chlorophylls are the catalysts in photosynthesis, while porphyrins and their metal complexes serve, inter alia, as biomimics of chlorophylls and as potential photochemical sensitizers for treatment of tumors.  Professor Kevin Smith, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Davis, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program for his studies of the synthesis, structure, and reactivity of a wide variety of porphyrin, chlorophyll, and related compounds.  Through these studies, Professor Smith is not only addressing the specific issues of biomimicry and photosensitization, but also is developing the fundamental synthetic tools required for the further development of these important natural (or naturally-inspired) products.",
