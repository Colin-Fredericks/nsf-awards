 "awd_abstract_narration": "Triad Women in Science and Technology (TWIST) is a collaboration among colleges, universities, and secondary education in the Piedmont Triad of  North Carolina.  Its purpose is to develop relationships and opportunities that will allow Triad women and girls, from the 11th grade through college graduation, to see and to experience science, mathematics, and technology as attractive career options.  While many of the TWIST partners have developed independent programs and initiatives to support their own students, most lack the time and resources to develop comprehensive programs that would guide and support women in choosing science as a career.  Nor can most devote personnel to establishing the community linkages - with industry, professional science organizations, and faculty at other institutions - that could benefit their students considering science careers.  The TWIST project seeks to coordinate and to assess existing programs among its partnering organizations; to develop new programs that will facilitate interaction among Triad women in science; and to foster integration of the education community with the larger scientific and industrial community in the region.  The formation of TWIST allows the participating institutions to learn from each other, to share resources and experiences, and to plan effectively for a program that will benefit female students throughout the Triad.  Each institution will derive strength and energy from working collaboratively.",
