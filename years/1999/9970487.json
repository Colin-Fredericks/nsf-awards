The basic examples are (1) The co-sphere\r\nbundle of a compact manifold, (2) The strictly pseudoconvex\r\nboundary of a complex manifold.  Any contact manifold has a\r\ndistinguished algebra of pseudo-differential operators called the\r\nHeisenberg algebra.  Epstein and Melrose, building on work of\r\nBoutet de Monvel and Guillemin, identified a family of order zero\r\nprojection operators in the Heisenberg algebra, generalizing the\r\nSzego projector defined on the boundary of a complex manifold.\r\nThey established that if S, S' are two such projectors then the\r\nprojection defined by S from the image of S' to the image of S is\r\na Fredholm map.  Let i(S,S') denote the index of this\r\nrestriction.  We call this the relative index.  By considering\r\nHeisenberg operators which act on vector bundles, many classical\r\nindex problems can be re-phrased as relative index problems for\r\npairs of generalized Szego projectors.  The main thrust of the\r\nproposed research is to obtain formulae for the relative index in\r\nterms of more classical geometric invariants, such as indices of\r\nDirac operators and holomorphic Euler characteristics.  A general\r\nrelative index formula of this type will allow Epstein and\r\nMelrose to completely settle the general case of the\r\nAtiyah-Weinstein problem, asking for a geometric formula for the\r\nindex of an FIO defined by a contact diffeomorphism between two\r\nco-sphere bundles.  Beyond this the investigator plans to search\r\nfor analytic invariants of contact structures.  Using an approach\r\nsuggested by Lempert and an extension of the Heisenberg algebra\r\nhe hopes to obtain a second formula for i(S,S'), which should be\r\nuseful in studying the small embeddable deformations of the\r\nCR-structure on a strictly pseudoconvex, compact CR-manifold.\r\n\r\nPartial differential equations are the principal tool for\r\nmathematical descriptions of problems in physics, chemistry,\r\neconomics, etc., and it is a fundamental problem to decide how\r\nmany solutions, if any, such an equation has.  In general this\r\nproblem is too delicate to solve exactly, but there is a number\r\ncalled the Fredholm index which can estimate the number of\r\nsolutions.  The main result in this subject is the \"Atiyah-Singer\r\nIndex Theorem.\"  The research proposed by Epstein is concerned\r\nwith extending these ideas to more general classes of equations\r\nwhich arise in the context of \"contact manifolds,\" a natural\r\narena for problems in mechanics and control theory.  Analytical\r\ntools are being developed which should have many applications\r\nbeyond the formula for the Fredholm index.\r\n",
