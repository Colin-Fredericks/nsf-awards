The goals\r\nare (1) To give an explicit combinatorial description of\r\ninfinitesimal deformations of a compact Riemann surface in terms\r\nof deformations of graphs on the topological model of the\r\nsurface. This will establish a canonical diffeomorphism between\r\nthe differentiable orbifold structure of the moduli space of\r\npointed Riemann surfaces that is obtained by the Strebel theory\r\nand the algebro-geometric construction over the field of complex\r\nnumbers. (2) To find an algebraic and combinatorial description\r\nof the relation between ribbon graphs and Riemann surfaces. It is\r\nproposed to study an algebro-geometric counterpart of a ribbon\r\ngraph with complex edge length. This study is expected to lead to\r\na discovery of algebraic description of the relation between\r\nribbon graphs and Riemann surfaces. (3) To establish a theory of\r\ntranscendental solutions of the KP equations. A class of matrix\r\nintegrals give totally new solutions of the KP equations which\r\nare not obtained by the generalized higher-rank Krichever\r\nconstruction. These matrix integrals include generating functions\r\nof the orbifold Euler characteristics of the moduli spaces of\r\npointed Riemann surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe motion of any string-like object in space-time leads to a\r\nRiemann surface as it sweeps out some region. The DNA strands in\r\nour body, for example, come from our ancestors. We can imagine a\r\nDNA loop, that was created a long time ago, has been traveling in\r\ntime and now stored in our cell. The whole history of this\r\nparticular DNA is described by a Riemann surface. The time slice\r\nof the surface is the DNA at this particular time. We do not know\r\nthe exact past of our genes. But we can consider the collection\r\nof all possible scenarios that would end up with the current\r\nstructure of our DNA. This collection is the moduli space of\r\nRiemann surfaces. Deeper analysis of the collection of all\r\npossible past of our genes through studying the moduli spaces is\r\nexpected to lead us to a better understanding of molecular\r\nevolution of DNA.  Because of its connections to string theory in\r\nhigh energy physics and potential applications to molecular\r\nevolution of DNA, graduate and undergraduate students show strong\r\ninterests in this research, which interweaves algebra, geometry\r\nand analysis.\r\n",
