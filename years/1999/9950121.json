 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer graphics is a tool for the working scientists, mathematician, and engineer.  The value of computer graphics is expanding as the scientific culture embraces scientific visualization and as powerful computers become more commonly available.   The traditional computer science course in computer graphics has required a level of computer science sophistication that has made it inaccessible to other science and engineering students.  Now that new graphics tools are readily useable by students who have programming knowledge, but are not computer science majors, the introductory computer graphics can be revised to accommodate a broader range of students.  \r\n\r\nThis proof-of-concept project creates a set of materials to support a computer graphics course accessible to students with only the first year computer science programming courses.   Thus students from other science and technical fields will be able to take the course along with computer science students to learn how to use the new graphics tools now available.   These materials are being developed in collaboration with the San Diego Supercomputer Center and are being evaluated, tested, and disseminated in conjunction with the ACM SIGGRAPH Education Committee.",
