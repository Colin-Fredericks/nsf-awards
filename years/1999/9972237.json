 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe principal investigator (PI) considers problems which involve sums of dependent variables and whose solutions require the use of existing and new results of the theory of decoupling. Decoupling theory has been very successful in translating problems involving dependent variables into ones involving independent variables through the use of inequalities specially designed for that purpose. In this research the PI will study three major problems, and consider approaches (including decoupling methods) that may be used in solving them. The first problem involves a general and natural approach to approximate the expected waiting time for a random process to hit a boundary in terms of the function determined by the expected value of the supremum of the process. This approach permits the use of the historical averages in developing useful approximations. The second problem concerns an approximation to the speed of convergence of sums of dependent variables in terms of known results for sums of independent variables. This problem has the potential of widely expanding the applicability of the principle of conditioning, a method that extends the martingale central limit theorem. The third problem develops probability approximations for self-normalized martingales. Results from this problem have the potential to impact several areas of probability and statistics, including the theory of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, since typically self-normalized variables serve as pivotal quantities in the construction of confidence intervals and tests of hypothesis.\r\n\tA common assumption made in the development of statistical and probabilistic methods concerns the predicate that the variables or processes are independent or have independence properties, that is, what happens to one of the variables does not affect what happens to the other. This independence assumption has the effect of simplifying the mathematical complexity of the problem and is quite common in practice. Due to this simplification it seems natural to seek approaches that would permit the use of results involving independent variables in the case the variables are dependent. The PI has been heavily involved in such a project through the development of ``Decoupling'' theory which has the above paradigm as its goal. His first problem in the current research is to develop a probabilistic theory for the use of historical data to obtain estimates of the time dependent processes take to reach a boundary. His preliminary work provides useful connections between the study of this problem and the study of the case of boundary crossing by non-random functions through the use of the average (or expected) behavior of the processes involved. This work has the potential to impact profoundly several areas of scientific knowledge where boundary crossing times are important and historical knowledge of the behavior of the process in question is available. Examples of specific areas of application include approximations to waiting time for: 1) an earthquake to happen, 2) for the next tornado to arrive, 3) for a dam to overflow, 4) for a computer to crash. All this when historical records are available. The second problem involves the development of results connecting the efficiency of approximations used involving independent variables to obtain similar approximations for dependent variables, a potentially cost saving device for choosing between competing statistical procedures. The third problem involves the study of self-normalized statistics based on dependent variables or processes. This type of statistic provides key quantities used in the development of confidence intervals for parameters. An example of how dependence enters into this type of problem concerns the development of interval estimates for the percentage of voters which will vote for a given candidate in the case the voters do not act independently but influence each other's \r\ndecisions.",
