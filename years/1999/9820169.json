This is a natural extension of work performed under a previous NSF grant on two-phase liquid Ga-Pb alloys in which complete wetting of the Ga-rich phase by the Pb-rich phase was demonstrated.  The approaches to be used in this study include measurement of liquid alloy surface energies by means of the sessile drop technique, coupled with direct measurements of adsorption at the liquid surfaces by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES).  In addition, the gravitational thinning of the (denser) Pb-rich liquid layer at the surface of the (less dense) Ga-rich liquid phase is investigated in binary Ga-Pb alloys.  This is accomplished by AES measurements of the thickness of the Pb layer as a function of liquid drop height.  The second thrust of the research addresses wetting transitions in solid two-phase alloys.  No previous work on wetting transitions has been reported in solid binary alloys.  The Au-Ni system is identified as one in which a transition in wetting of the Ni-rich phase by the Au-rich phase is likely to take place.  The wetting transition is investigated by studying the associated Au adsorption (segregation) phenomena at the surface of the Ni-rich phase.  The adsorption of Au at the surfaces of single-phase Ni-rich alloys is studied as samples are cooled towards the miscibility gap, where Au-rich and Ni-rich phases coexist.  The adsorption behavior of Au is expected to be quite different at temperatures above and below the wetting temperature.\r\n%%%\r\nWhereas a great deal of research has been performed over the past several years to develop improved fundamental understanding of wetting transitions, most of this work has focused on wetting transitions in liquid organic mixtures, or in adsorbed noble gases.  In contrast, little research has been devoted to the nature of these phenomena in metallic alloys, where the interactions are quite different.  Thus this research has a potential for leading to exciting new science.  In addition, the selected alloys represent a large class of technologically interesting materials.  For instance, the study of wetting phenomena is clearly important in developing better fundamental understanding of solid and liquid phase sintering, of liquid metal joining processes, of metal refining, and of liquid metal embrittlement.\r\n***\r\n",
