Primitive species as well as higher vertebrates are capable of self/non-self recognition and defense, and thus can provide a basis for understanding the strategies adopted by higher organisms during the evolution of the immune system. In particular, recent advances using the techniques of molecular biology and protein chemistry have led to rapid identification of the many specialized genes and their encoded proteins that comprise the immune systems of different species.  This information has led to important new insights into how these molecules have evolved.  This meeting is designed to attract a multidisciplinary group of U.S. and foreign scientists, including immunologists, evolutionary biologists, biochemists, molecular biologists, geneticists and cell biologists interested in this area. The topics to be covered at the meeting include evolution of recognition molecules, protease cascades, antibacterial peptides, cellular and humoral responses, and insect immunity.  Two poster sessions will allow attendees to present and discuss their work.  Plans include publication of the proceedings to educate the larger immunological and more general scientific communities.\r\n",
