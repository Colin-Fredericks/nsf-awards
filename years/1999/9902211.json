 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropical rainforests experience periods of drought and our studies indicate that rainforest trees, including Prioria copaifera, are drought-sensitive. Tropical forests also are among the most diverse ecosystems on earth and the relative absence of drought may permit greater diversity. These observations led the PIs to propose that the reduced diversity of many tropical forests may be the consequence of periodic drought. The PIs research focuses on P. copaifera, a species that occurs in nearly pure stands in Panama even though the surrounding, nonflooded forest is highly diverse. In an average year, P. copaifera experiences flooding followed by drought. The PIs hypothesize that this is a severely stressful environment for plants and that the dominance by P. copaifera is explained by adaptations permitting it to survive and grow where there is extreme variation in water availability. This hypothesis is consistent with recent proposals that tolerance of flooding, while necessary, may not be sufficient to explain the distributions of plants in flooded habitats. Instead, it is hypothesized that the capacity of a species to respond to drought conditions that follow the end of flooding may also be very important. P. copaifera also is the main tree harvested in Panama and a better understanding of its requirements for establishment will assist in developing a management plan for this species.\r\n\r\n",
