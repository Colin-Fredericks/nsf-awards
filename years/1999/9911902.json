 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project studies the feasibility of obtaining neighborhood-level (tract) crime data from police departments across the U.S.  Currently, there is no large representative sample of crime data available at the community level. If feasible, the investigators will develop a larger project to collect such crime data for multiple U. S. cities (up to 110) for year 2000, and combine these crime data with additional information from the U.S. Census and other publicly available data sources.  The general purpose of a national neighborhood crime project is to more systematically examine how community structures within different types of cities are linked to crime in neighborhoods of varying racial/ethnic and class composition.  Prior researchers have explored the predictors of neighborhood crime patterns within cities, but our understanding of neighborhood variation in crime is limited due to the lack of readily available crime data at the neighborhood level for cities across the nation.  This lack of data has made it impossible to address issues of:  (1) the generalizability of previous findings regarding neighborhood crime patterns since studies only examine neighborhoods in one or a small number of settings; (2) whether the conditions present in different types of cities influence the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and crime; and (3) the separate effects of racial and class composition of local areas on crime rates.  In light of these shortcomings in our understanding of neighborhood crime, the goal of this research is to compile tract-level crime data for a large sample of cities throughout the U.S. that vary substantially in sociodemographic and economic structure, including race and class composition, and to link these data with a consistent set of neighborhood, city, and metropolitan sociodemographic and economic variables for the same time period. These data will then be used to address the above questions and related substantive issues.  \r\n\r\n To assess the feasibility of acquiring the requisite data on neighborhood crime, the investigators will:  (1) make contact with random samples of city police departments requesting such data; (2) use the contacts made to gain information on the form and nature of available data; (3) make site visits to several departments to gain insights into the constraints departments in different types of cities face, and to identify appropriate strategies for gaining cooperation from different departments; and (4) assess the kinds and degrees of problems that will be encountered in trying to use data from different departments by attempting to code and construct crime variables from data actually acquired, and by having the address-based crime data geocoded to census tracts. \r\n",
