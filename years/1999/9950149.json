 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, structured upon the educational model presented by Wikle and Lambert (1996) for integrating GPS into college curricula, integrates the use of statistical and spatial analytical techniques.   Adapting Global Positioning System (GPS) technology within the Geography and Environmental Studies Programs provides students with a variety of interdisciplinary skills that have aided them in:  1) constructing research hypotheses,  2) developing research methodologies, 3) collecting data, 4) analyzing, and 5) preparing presentations. This project recognizes that most environmental data are spatial in nature and require an understanding of location and use GPS technology to provide an effective technique for determining location and a method of recording the spatial characteristics of the environment. Students are exposed to GPS theory and application in forums ranging from introductory lectures and labs to more sophisticated GPS applications in junior- and senior-level classes. At the introductory level, this approach introduces a wide, interdisciplinary audience to GPS technology, its scientific foundations, and its growing importance in society. At the advanced level, this initiative exposes geography and environmental studies students to advanced mapping techniques using GPS and the integration of these data within GIS.",
