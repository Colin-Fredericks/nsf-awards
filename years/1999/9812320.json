Trzynadlowski of the University of Nevada at Reno and Dr. Marian P. Kazmierkowski of the Institute of Control and Industrial Electronics of the Warsaw University of Technology.  The researchers intend to develop novel control schemes for environment-friendly and energy-efficient power electronic converters.  The project should yield two types of high-performance power electronic converters: a pulse-width modulated (PWM) rectifier and a PWM four-leg inverter to be used in adjustable-speed ac drive systems, uninterruptable power supplies, and interference, energy losses, and cost of the converters, while increasing their reliability.  Results of the project will enhance the current power electronic technology, with the consequent advantages for U.S. and Polish industries.  When implemented, the enhanced converters will reduce the electromagnetic and environmental pollution in power systems.   Also, the quality of graduate education at both universities will benefit from the cooperation.\r\n\r\nThis research in electrical engineering fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
