The American attendees will contribute as panelists   \r\ndiscussing research  and educational programs, participate in special workshops which will be held in conjunction with the conference, and present state- of- the- art reviews.  The conference will provide a forum for the synthesis of the knowledge base that has been developed and in isolating key issues to be addressed in future research.  In the field of thermal science and technologies, India is one of the leading Asian countries and research performed by its scientists is of particular relevance to the developing nations and of interest to the global community.  The conference will include workshops held off side on industrial research emerging thermal technologies  solidification, computational fluid mechanics, and materials processing and manufacturing.  Participation is expected to be of the order of 400, with 40 US and 50 European attendees.\r\n",
