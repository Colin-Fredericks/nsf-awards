Special emphasis will\r\nbe put on geometry and topology of cohomogeneity one manifolds,\r\ni.e. manifolds on which a Lie group acts with one dimensional\r\nquotient. One goal will be to show that every cohomogeneity one\r\nmanifold has a metric with non-negative sectional curvature,\r\nwhich would imply that many exotic spheres admit a metric with\r\nnon-negative sectional curvature.  The second goal will be to\r\nclassify cohomogeneity one manifolds with positive sectional\r\ncurvature, with the hope of finding some new examples of compact\r\nmanifolds with positive sectional curvature. For non-compact\r\nmanifolds, we will examine the converse to the Cheeger Gromoll\r\nsoul theorem, which asks which vector bundles over compact\r\nnon-negatively curved manifolds admit complete metrics with\r\nnon-negative curvature. This can be done by examining\r\ncohomogeneity one action on the principal bundle of the vector\r\nbundle.  Further studies include the classification of primitive\r\nsubgroups of finite dimensional Lie groups and global variational\r\nproperties of the scalar curvature functional on homogeneous\r\nspaces.\r\n\r\nA subject of major interest in Riemannian geometry over the last\r\n30 years has been the geometry of exotic spheres, which are\r\nmanifolds that look like spheres but on which ordinary calculus\r\nis quite different. These objects were discovered 40 years ago by\r\nMilnor and ever since then geometers were interested in finding a\r\ngeometric description of them where the natural local invariants\r\nlook like spheres, i.e. where the curvature is positive or\r\nnon-negative. In our project we have found many new examples of\r\nexotic spheres where the curvature is non-negative and have\r\nfurther plans for finding more such examples. A natural question\r\nis if one can deform these to metrics with positive curvature,\r\none of the most intriguing open problems in global Riemannian\r\ngeometry.  Our major technique is to examining symmetry\r\nproperties of such objects and related manifolds. A large group\r\nof symmetries usually implies interesting geometric and\r\ntopological properties and has always been a key ingredient in\r\nmany mathematical subjects. We were able to construct many new\r\nmanifolds with non-negative curvature and such large symmetry\r\ngroups, which has a number of interesting applications, both in\r\ngeometry and topology.\r\n",
