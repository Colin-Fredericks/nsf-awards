 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, carried out in the laboratory of Professor Thomas Beebe at the University of Utah, in collaboration with Charles Stewart of DuPont Central Research, is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program under the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry program.  The research addresses the interface formed between solution deposited copolymers of polytetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene and various metallic and glass substrates.  Various spectroscopic probes are used to characterize the polymer-substrate interface, and to relate its structure and composition to the interfacial adhesion.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy will provide chemical state information about the interface, and TOF-SIMS and scanning probe microscopy will be used to characterize the polymer composition and morphology.  A collaborative team, involving scientists and students from Utah as well as staff scientists at DuPont will work together to explore these novel and technologically useful systems. \r\n\r\nSpectroscopic studies of novel fluoropolymer-substrate interfaces are being explored in this collaborative research project involving the University of Utah and DuPont Central Research.  Chemical state information, polymer composition, and surface morphological studies are combined to give a clear picture of interfacial bonding in fluoropolymer-metal and fluoropolymer- glass systems.  These new solution based fluoropolymer coatings promise a number of important technological applications in corrosion resistant and low friction wear coatings. \r\n",
