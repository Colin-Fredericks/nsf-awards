 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School of Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Georgia Institute of Technology is supported by the the Chemistry Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate of Mathematics and Physical Sciences under the \"Research Sites for Educators in Chemistry\" program.  Dr. E. Kent Barefield is the Principal Investigator.  Georgia Tech will collaborate on this project with forty-one undergraduate institutions located in Georgia and twenty-seven four-year institutions located in contiguous states.  Eleven of the Georgia institutions and all of the institutions in contiguous states have  large enrollments of students from minority groups.  Each year four or more faculty members of those colleges will spend one or two semesters as well as the following summer at Georgia Tech.  Funds will be provided to allow the undergraduate institution to hire temporary replacements for those faculty members.  A substantial amount of faculty-replacement funds will be provided by Georgia Tech.  Each faculty member will affiliate with a specific research group and conduct chemical research in that group.  When appropriate selected qualified undergraduates may join faculty from their institutions in the Georgia Tech laboratories for summer research.  Through this program Georgia Tech will provide modest support for ongoing research in the colleges, including remote access via the internet, to NMR and ESR spectrometers.  A primary objective of the program is to initiate research collaborations that may be continued in future years.\r\n\r\nResearch Sites for Educators in Chemistry (RSEC) bring together the faculty of participating two-year colleges, baccalaureate colleges, and master's universities with faculty at research universities within a geographic region to enhance the research and educational opportunities at all participating institutions.  Academic and research institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learner perspectives.  RSECs such as this one at the Georgia Institute of Technology provide mechanisms for disseminating the knowledge, skills, practices and ethics of research to a broader community, including those from underrepresented groups; assist in developing viable, sustainable research programs at participating institutions; and involve faculty and students at the participating institutions with a broader cross-section of faculty and students.\r\n",
