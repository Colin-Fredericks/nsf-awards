 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is directed toward the fabrication and performance evaluation of a new generation of oxygen anion conducting solid electrolytes.  These new materials, derived from the brownmillerite solid state structure, are being selected because of their near term potential for achieving higher oxygen anion conductivity and chemical stability than currently technically available materials. Technology emerging in this program will enable improved performance for:   (1) electrically driven atmospheric oxygen separation;  (2) intermediate temperature Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs); and, (3) fast response chemical sensors, to give but a few examples. Both electrolytic oxygen separation and SOFC technology will be made economically more competitive by lowering present severe materials hardware constraints resulting from high operating temperatures associated with the use of Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) solid electrolyte. Moderate temperature electrochemical devices based upon such advanced solid electrolytes will also have the added advantage of requiring less expensive hardware components for their commercial implementation.  Work to this stage in the program has identified oxygen anion conducting solid electrolytes which possess:   (1) excellent chemical stability under simultaneous oxidizing and reducing conditions;  (2) insignificant parasitic electronic conductivity; and, (3) an oxygen anion conductivity approximately twice that of YSZ from DC measurements, representative of those conditions anticipated in electrochemical devices.\r\nWork being performed in this program will result in clarifying a new generation of oxygen anion conducting electrolytes which are anticipated to find commercial application in intermediate temperature electrochemical devices, such as electrolytic oxygen generators, fuel cells, and chemical sensors.\r\n\r\n",
