 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a natural listening environment many sounds exhibit a positive\r\ncorrelation between changes in pitch and loudness.  As sounds get louder,\r\nthey tend to get higher in pitch.  Surprisingly, most previous research on\r\npitch and loudness perception has used static tones that remain constant in\r\nboth frequency and intensity.  This has yielded static structural models of\r\npitch and loudness perception that may not accurately reflect the perception\r\nof pitch and loudness in a natural listening environment.  Recent work has\r\nshown that under dynamic conditions, pitch and loudness interact in a way\r\nthat is opposite that predicted by these static models.  The current project\r\nsets forth a theoretical framework in which it is proposed that the dynamic\r\nperceptual interaction of pitch and loudness has evolved to take advantage\r\nof the correlation between frequency and intensity change that occurs in a\r\nnatural listening environment.  Under various experimental conditions,\r\nlisteners will be presented with frequency- and amplitude-modulated sounds,\r\nand in a variety of psychophysical experiments make perceptual judgments\r\nabout positively and negatively correlated changes in frequency and\r\nintensity.  The findings will provide an empirically based, theoretical\r\naccount of dynamic pitch and loudness interaction, and provide some\r\npreliminary information about the location of the mediating neural\r\nmechanisms. The work has potential implications for the hearing impaired,\r\ncommunications, auditory display, and sensory substitution systems for the\r\nblind. \r\n\r\n",
