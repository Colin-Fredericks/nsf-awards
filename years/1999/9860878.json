 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860878\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project examines the potential for characterizing ceramic powders and fibers using an innovative elliptically polarized light scattering method.  Particle size, size distribution, and shape are key factors in manufacturing advanced ceramic materials, which rely on precise mixtures of fine and coarse particles.  IOTA's can determine these parameters via a unique approach for optimizing polarization settings.  Unlike current on line particle measuring techniques, cylindrical and irregular shapes (such as particle agglomerates) can be evaluated.  The ability to discern such shapes can have a great impact for improving ceramic quality and process control, important for product development and reduced costs.  This investigation will assess the feasibility of using the system at a ceramic manufacturing site.  Fundamental research is proposed to closely examine the accuracy of the instrument (comparing results with electron micrographs) for a variety of particle sizes, shapes, and size distributions.  A particle loading study is also proposed to evaluate under what conditions the system can operate.  Phase I will focus on evaluating system accuracy and acceptable working conditions for measuring ceramic powders and whiskers.  In Phase II a prototype system will be constructed and tested at a ceramic manufacturing plant. Particle agglomeration will also be studied.\r\n     The ability to measure fine particle sizes and shapes is necessary for controlling the quality of many high technology products, such as advanced ceramics and pharmaceuticals.  In addition, monitoring and controlling particle size is fundamental to the manufacture of many consumer products (cosmetics, paints, pigments), textiles, food processing, medical apparatus (parenteral solutions, blood processing), and environmental monitoring.\r\n",
