(EDC) is a comprehensive set of materials designed to improve science teaching and learning in early childhood centers for preschool children ages 3 to 5.  The materials support administrators, staff developers, teachers, and families in developing the knowledge and skills they need to bring quality science education to the young children in their programs.  The Tool Kit provides the early childhood and science education communities with a new understanding of young children's capabilities and a comprehensive approach to improving the quality of science education in the many and varied early childhood programs throughout the country.\r\nSpecifically the Tool Kit Provides:\r\n\r\nA Framework for Early Childhood Science Instruction\r\nThree Curriculum Guides (Earth, Physical, and Life Science)\r\nA Guide For Staff Developers\r\nSupport Materials for Early Childhood Program Administrators\r\nParent Materials\r\nVideotapes of Classroom Practice\r\n\r\nThe work of this project is based on the knowledge that has emerged from decades of research into the cognitive development of young children, as well as experience and research into developmentally appropriate practice.  It is grounded in the work of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and the views of science and scientific inquiry as expressed in the National Science Education Standards.  Finally, it draws from work of two centers within EDC, the Center for Science Education with over 10 years of experience working on urban systemic reform and developing curriculum materials in science, and the Center for Children & Families with 21 years of involvement with Head Start.  The materials will be piloted in five early childhood centers in the Boston area and will be field tested in over one hundred classrooms in 30 early childhood centers from across the country.\r\n\r\n",
