 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972200\r\nPennington\r\n\r\nThis research uses primarily Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements designed to address key issues concerning the normal state and superconducting state electronic structure and the charge and spin dynamics of the cuprate \"high temperature superconductors.\" A primary thrust of the project is an effort to exploit fully a technique, known as \"small tip angle echo NMR,\" to characterize as fully as possible the spin correlations in the cuprates and their dependence upon temperature and composition.  The small tip angle technique was developed recently to measure individually the \"indirect\" or \"electron mediated\" couplings between pairs of nuclei, and thereby to probe the real part of the electronic spin susceptibility.  The information derived is complementary to that obtained from inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and from NMR spin-lattice relaxation, both of which probe the imaginary part of the susceptibility.  Two additional thrusts are pursued.  The first is a continuation of investigations of the contrasting high temperature NMR behavior of the 63Cu, 17O, and 89Y nuclei, in order to assess the validity of the \"single component\" electronic structure picture of the CuO2 planes.  The second is a continuing probe of the magnetic field and doping dependence of the \"pseudo-gap\" phenomenon, using fields up to 27T accessible through the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.\r\n%%%\r\nThis project is an investigation of high temperature superconductor compounds, using the experimental technique of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Project experiments are designed to test competing theoretical models of the \"mechanism\" of superconductivity in these materials. The improvements in our basic understanding will also assist in the development of new classes of superconductors with more desirable properties for applications. The NMR experiments are of a challenging nature and the project provides varied educational experiences for a diverse team of graduate and undergraduate students and post-doctoral research associates. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
