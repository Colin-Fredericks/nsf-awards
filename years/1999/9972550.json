The session on  Set-Theoretic Topology and its Applications will stress the interplay  among the classical topics of topology and analysis, including the newly  defined field of study called set-theoretic analysis.  The Dynamical  Systems session will include the application of tools from continuum  theory to this subject.  A goal of the session on Topological Groups is  to discuss the new methods in this area used in solving problems in  functional analysis and stochastic processes.  Topological vector spaces  and rings of continuous functions will be the principal areas of the  Topological Algebraic Structures session.  The fifth special session,  Asymmetric Topology/Topology and Computer Science, will be devoted mostly  to applications of techniques from topology to computer science.  Talks  in this session will be on such topics as domain theory and semantics of  programming languages, and digital topology and computer visualization.   In addition to the special sessions two workshops will be given.  The  Dynamics and Topology of Entire Functions workshop will describe how  Cantor bouquets, indecomposable continua, explosion points, and a  topological kneading invariant play a principal role in determining the  dynamics of certain maps, while the workshop on Topological Groups will  discuss projective limits and balanced groups.  \r\n\r\nThe Summer Conference series on General Topology and its Applications began in 1984 at the City College of New York with 35 participants and 13 talks; the 13th such Conference, in Mexico City, June 1998, was the third held abroad; it had about 150 participants from across the United States and 27 other countries, and featured 110 talks. The reason for this growth is in the recent history of general topology. This field studies generalized shapes and limits, and was developed to solve problems elsewhere in mathematics. After a time of concentration on problems internal to it, the emphasis in topology is again turning toward applications to other areas. Almost half our invited speakers work outside topology, but apply it; so participants gain new research ideas and connections between other fields and topology.  Here is an  example relating topology and computer science: Exact computation of real  numbers is impossible as long as only finite amounts of information can  be stored. But using topology the set of real numbers and some other such  important examples can be shown to have \"approximation models\" that allow  arbitrarily accurate computation of their elements, an essential for all  sensitive calculations such as those used for weather prediction and  space flight.  Joint work by Conference participants, including some  which took place at our Conferences, led to proof that an object has an  approximation model precisely if it is a \"Polish space\". This is  particularly satisfying since Polish spaces are among the first objects  discovered by topologists, and have been studied for almost a century\r\n",
