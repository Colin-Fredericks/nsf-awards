Burkett\r\n\r\n\r\nBoise State University (BSU) is in a unique position to offer research experience in the microelectronics area to undergraduates from across the nation.  The presence of local microelectronics industry was one of the primary motivations for the formation of the College of Engineering at BSU in 1996.  Faculty members from the newly formed College plan to team with faculty in Computer Science and Chemistry who are already actively involved in a variety of different aspects related to the microelectronics area.  The specific objectives of the proposed REU program include: training of undergraduates in microelectronics research, development of skills appropriate for undergraduates that will offer them increased opportunities in the future, raising student interest and awareness in graduate studies, and making future contacts for students with fellow REU students and participating faculty advisors at BSU.  The opportunity to perform research in the area of microelectronics will be extended to undergraduates with an emphasis on highly qualified students from groups, that is underrepresented in engineering and the sciences.\r\n\r\nResearch projects will include a variety of topics and involve training in state-of-the art instrumentation and techniques.  Topics to be researched include: environmental aspects of alternative wafer cleaning techniques, simulation of IC processes, computer modeling, characterization of high-frequency devices, reliability of magnetic field sensors, microelectronic switching devices, and polymer processing.  Facilities include well-equipped laboratories and advanced computing capabilities.  The majority of the REU students will be performing research in a newly constructed Class 1000 cleanroom that was made possible by acquisition of both local industrial donations and university funds.  This lab includes a variety of processing, metrology, and device characterization equipment.  The proposed REU site at BSU will enhance the quality of undergraduate education by providing research opportunities with faculty members working in the area of microelectronics.\r\n",
