Steinbart will explore how one can infer fundamental qualitative properties of the solutions of certain linear and nonlinear complex differential equations directly from the data (e.g., the coefficients) of the equations. The properties on which she will focus are the growth of the solutions, and the location and distribution of the zeros of the solutions. Steinbart is interested in developing and refining analytical tools which can be applied to both linear and nonlinear complex differential equations. In the case of linear differential equations, she will address some fundamental open questions regarding the location of the zeros of solutions for a class of second order homogeneous equations that includes Airy's equation and Titchmarsh's equation. She will also consider nonhomogeneous linear differential equations, the global theory of which has not been thoroughly explored. Finally, she will study specific nonlinear equations (e.g., the second order equations which define Painleve transcendents) with the intent of uncovering relationships between the structure of the equations and the qualitative behavior of their solutions. Progress in this direction would allow her to take a novel approach to certain problems of great current interest, such as a deeper understanding of the relationship between the complex nonlinear Painleve equations and completely integrable nonlinear partial differential equations.\r\n\r\nIn this project, Steinbart will apply her unique mathematical background to study an important class of differential equations in the complex plane. Differential equations are widely used to model physical, chemical, and biological systems. In many cases, the model and/or the equations which describe the model are so complicated that one cannot determine the solution of the equation explicitly. Instead, one tries to approximate the solution or else deduce important properties of the solution without actually solving the equation. The goal of this research is to contribute to the theory of differential equations by uncovering information regarding the behavior of the solutions of the equations based on the data included in the differential equations themselves. If mathematicians can obtain a deeper understanding of the behavior of the solutions of the equations, then applied scientists who routinely use them will be able to construct their models more effectively. Steinbart will use techniques from complex analysis and from differential equations in this project.\r\n",
