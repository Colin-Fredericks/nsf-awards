Broman (University of Wisconsin)\r\n\"Creating a Space for Expertise:  Criticism and the Public Sphere in Germany, 1760-1800\"\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to study the historical antecedents of the modern concept of expertise. What is meant here by \"expertise\" is a distinctively modern linkage between theoretical knowledge and practice, a linkage that licenses the work of physicians, engineers, social workers, and a variety of other professional experts. The Enlightenment is an obvious place to locate the origins of this concept, because Enlightenment ideology featured both an exaltation of empirical science as the key to discovering reliable truths about the world and the programmatic conviction that such knowledge should be put to work in combating prejudice, reforming morals, and creating a better society. Yet the concept of expertise that developed out of this ideology is built upon two claims that at first glance would seem to be mutually contradictory. On the one hand, the scientific knowledge on which expert practices came to be based is claimed to be universally accessible to enlightened human reason. But on the other hand, experts reserve for themselves alone the right to create, evaluate, and proclaim that knowledge. As a result of this peculiar combination, modern experts literally represent us (insofar as we are all members of a collective \"public\") when speaking truths about the world.\r\n\r\nThis project thus seeks to explore the historical circumstances in which it first became possible to maintain that knowledge was both universal (in the sense of being potentially accessible to all people) and privileged. It examines this phenomenon not by looking at any particular sciences or the activities of their promoters, but instead by analyzing the broader cultural milieu in which such claims for universality and privilege first developed. By doing so, the project aims to cast light on what it means for something to be called \"public knowledge,\" and the context for this investigation will be the development of the public sphere in German Central Europe between 1750 and 1800. First described by Jurgen Habermas more than 30 years ago as an intermediate zone between the public authority of the state and the private realm of civil society, the 1 8th-century public sphere became a particular center of cultural production, one expressing the generalized beliefs of \"the public.\" Needless to say, the existence of a \"public\" in the sense described here is an essential condition for the emergence of the kind of representative truth-telling embodied by experts.\r\n\r\nA distinctive and important feature of this new public sphere was the emergence of the peculiarly modern institution of \"criticism,\" a kind of literature in which private individuals sought to speak both for and to the public by defining objective standards of reason and taste. The project seeks to show how criticism was crucial in the creation of science as public knowledge, because criticism featured precisely the same combination of universality and privileged knowledge, along with the same union of theory and practice that scientific experts would later deploy. Moreover, what was distinctive about 18th-century criticism was the extent to which it was embodied in a new medium: the literary review. This suggests a second line of approach to understanding the formation of the German public sphere, which is to situate its evolution, and the evolution of critical discourse along with it, as part of the history of the periodical press.\r\n\r\nThe project thus combines an analysis of critical discourse and expertise in the German periodical press with a study of the changing conditions of the publishing business and the market for literature during the second half of the 18th century. In proceeding along these two paths, Broman hopes to be able to show how criticism, expertise, and ultimately, the authority of science itself cannot be adequately understood apart from the changing economic and cultural circumstances of middle-class consumption during the 18th century.\r\n",
