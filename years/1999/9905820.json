A successful implementation of the project will make it possible for cell biologists to construct and test models as an aid to understanding their experiments.  An important complement to this project would be a database containing models, images, and biochemical and eletrophysiological data; such a database would not only support the Virtual Cell, but would also, independently, be an invaluable resource for the cell biology community.\r\n\tThis proposal aims at investigating the feasibility of developing a database that can support the Virtual Cell.  We will attempt to build a database that includes sets of equations that describe biochemical and electrophysiological reactions, cell geometry derived from microscopic images and spatial relationships amount the compartments of a cell.  During this feasibility study, our data gathering will focus mostly on the data that are already available from our own laboratories.  In addition, we will attempt to compile, group, and store a limited set of published reaction kinetics, eletrophysiological data, images and models into the database.  Overall, our research focus associated with the database construction will be to study feasibility of organizing diversified sets of heterogeneous computational data so that the data can be seamlessly integrated into production and evaluation of computation models demonstrating complex cell biochemistry processes.\r\n\tThe impact of the Virtual Cell Project is to revolutionize the way cell biologists study complex functions and behaviors of a living organism.  A successful implementation of our feasibility study will allow us to produce a longer-term research framework.  The longer-term research framework, once successful, will allow scientists to observe and examine detailed steps of chemical and kinematic changes without performing an actual experiment.  We anticipate that such a resource would be very useful in both the laboratory and the classroom.\r\n",
