 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cleveland State University, representing the partners of the Woodlake Environmental Field Station, and the University of Akron will conduct a collaborative, coordinated planning effort for two field stations located in the Cuyahoga watershed of Northeast Ohio.  A central goal for the field stations is to support a research focus in urban ecology, especially studies of environmental change at the urban fringe and the effects of urban encroachment on previously undisturbed habitats and protected parklands.  The vision is that the stations will become regional and national centers for such research, and that work conducted there will contribute in a significant way to our understanding of urban ecosystems.  Also, the field stations will serve as core facilities for a consortium of researchers from several institutions.  The Woodlake Environmental and Bath Field Stations are also intended to become important regional and national resources in environmental education.  The broad ecological, socioeconomic, and land use coverage of this network will facilitate exciting educational opportunities highlighting the effects humans, their institutions, and activities  have on ecosystems.\r\n\r\nTo insure that the facilities, equipment, research and educational programs of the two field stations are properly developed and integrated for use in the broader scientific community, this project will  support  visits to other field stations and workshops in three areas: research, education, and station management.  The site visits will allow the examination of the infrastructure and land-management practices of several successful field stations, allowing the development of similar models at the two stations.  In the workshops, guidance will be sought from managers of established field stations and from distinguished researchers in the field of urban ecology. \r\n",
