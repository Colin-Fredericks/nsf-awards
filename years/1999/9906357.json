Helium thermochronometry is a powerful, newly-developed tool that constrains the cooling rocks experience as they rise through the upper few kilometers of crust.  Ages are determined by measuring radiogenic helium and uranium/thorium parent isotopes on small aliquots of apatite.  Because of the high diffusivity of helium in apatite, this thermochronometer is sensitive to temperatures lower than other techniques (e.g. apatite fission track dating) and provides quantitative control on rates and magnitude of rock uplift and exhumation.  It is thus provides valuable constraints on problems of landform evolution, mountain building, and other surface processes.  Helium dating may become the premier tool of the neotectonicist and geomorphologist, with helium ages becoming standard for any study to which denudation and topographic construction relate. \r\n\r\nThe grant will enable construction of a high-vacuum extraction line with a quadrupole mass spectrometer for the analysis of helium content in mineral separates.  Because this technique is relatively new, such a facility cannot be directly purchased and must be custom built.  Measurement of parent isotopes (U, Th) by isotope dilution can already be made with existing facilities at Virginia Tech.  The helium dating technique will be one of the main activities applied by the P.I., J.A. Spotila, a new addition to the faculty at Virginia Tech.  It will be applied to three major projects of landform evolution in the next several years, including studies of the Chugach/St. Elias Range in Alaska (active orogen) and the Appalachians (extinct orogen).  The dating facility will be one of only a few in the nation and will stimulate collaboration at both the regional and international level.  It will also be the basis of numerous graduate and undergraduate research projects.  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
