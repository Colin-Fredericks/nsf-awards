 "awd_abstract_narration": "Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Center\r\n(SPMC) is strategically located in the northern Puget Sound basin, providing\r\ndirect access from the mainland to a wide variety of marine and estuarine\r\nhabitats that support a rich and diverse biota.  The location and facilities provide\r\ndistinctive opportunities for process-oriented research on productivity of coastal\r\nwatersheds and wetlands, nutrient cycling and regeneration, microbial ecology, and\r\nbenthic metabolism and on life history phenomena of local fish, invertebrate,\r\nand marine plant species.  SPMC is actively involved in both undergraduate and \r\nMaster's of Science academic programs including serving as a site for upper\r\n division courses and supporting extensive undergraduate and graduate research.                                     Students come from both the home institution and from colleges and universities from\r\n around the country.  Programs for undergraduates include Research Experiences\r\n for Undergraduates, the Minorities in Marine Science Undergraduate Program and\r\n the Science Education and Research Undergraduate program.  To promote research and\r\nTraining, SPMC has developed a database accessible to visitors and remote \r\ninvestigators.  In cooperation with the nearby Padilla Bay National Estuarine\r\nResearch Reserve, SPMC has identified a number of model study sites that can support\r\nlong-term research in the region, particularly with respect to seagrass communities\r\nthat are unusually extensive for west coast estuaries.  In order to provide additional\r\nfocus to investigations of these communities that can both provide the basis for\r\nproductive collaborative research and address local and regional management\r\nconcerns, SPMC is developing an appropriate field and analytical facilities base.\r\nWith the addition of two new research vessels SPMC is well-equipped to pursue\r\non-site field investigations.  Because of greatly increased research and training\r\nactivity in recent years, however, analytical laboratory space has become a severely\r\nlimiting factor.  In order to pursue studies of geochemical and biochemical\r\nprocesses and to accommodate the interests of visiting investigators, SPMC\r\nwill renovate and properly furnish existing laboratory space for use as an\r\nadditional analytical laboratory, thus doubling available space for this purpose.\r\nSPMC will also purchase new analytical and support instrumentation not presently\r\navailable that will enhance the facilities capacity for research. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
