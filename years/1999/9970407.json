The proposed research\r\nincludes extending these results to obtain estimates for bilinear\r\nnull-forms of solutions, as well as estimates for eigenfunctions\r\nof the Laplacian on spaces with bounded curvature. The investigator\r\nis also involved in joint work studying the Strichartz and bilinear\r\nnullform estimates for waves which reflect from convex obstacles.\r\nPrevious joint research has obtained such estimates in bounded \r\nregions of space-time. The proposed research involves combining these \r\nlocal methods with known energy decay estimates to obtain such\r\nestimates valid globally in space and time. These results are then\r\nbeing applied to establish long time existence for certain nonlinear\r\nwave equations on the region exterior to a convex obstacle.\r\n\r\nThe development of techniques to handle partial differential equations\r\nwith low regularity coefficients is of both theoretical and practical\r\ninterest. The theoretical interest comes from the study of\r\nnonlinear equations in math and physics, such as Einstein's equations\r\nfor the gravitational field, or the equations of fluid dynamics. \r\nA central question for such equations is the \"long time\" existence\r\nof solutions; that is, showing that solutions do not blow up\r\nat some future time. The main technique for doing this is to show\r\nthat one can control the size of the nonlinear part of the equation\r\nin terms of quantities that are known to remain controlled, such\r\nas the energy of the solution. For Einstein's equations, this\r\nrequires understanding the wave equation with rough wave speeds.\r\nThe practical importance of such studies is that a theoretical\r\nunderstanding of the propagation of waves in rough media should\r\nlead to more efficient algorithms for the numerical computation\r\nof solutions. Our work involves splitting the solution into\r\nelementary pieces, each of which behaves in a particularly simple\r\nmanner. This is analogous to the decomposition of functions into\r\nwavelets, much of the modern theory of which was developed to\r\nunderstood nonlinear equations of stable-state phenomena. Wavelets\r\nhave in turn led to simple and stable algorithms for solving such \r\nequations, as well as to powerful algorithms in the fields of image\r\nand signal processing.\r\n",
