Computations of the motions of highly-articulated structures such as human figures depend on a general architecture for animation and control. In the past, system dynamics have been ignored when computing motions; the advantage of this omission is increased simplicity and speed in computation of the result. The computed motions may not be physically plausible, however, by violations of force, torque or velocity limits. By recasting the motion planning problem as an optimal control problem in the system state space, new algorithms yield a kinodynamic solution which addresses plausibility issues. Dr. Kuffner proposes to develop and test these new algorithms using open-chain articulated robots, including humanoid-type robots.\r\n\r\nThis award supports a two-year Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Dr. James J. Kuffner in the Department of Mechano-Informatics at the University of Tokyo, Japan. Dr. Kuffner will work with Dr. Hirochika Inoue, Professor in the Department, on a project entitled, \"Kinodynamic Planning for Articulated Robots.\" The successful results of this work have potential application to a wide variety of complex dynamical systems, including robot hovercrafts, satellites, articulated robot arms and humanoid robots, submarines, car-like robots, or robot planes and helicopters. The proposed work will benefit through collaboration with the Japanese host laboratory, where Dr. Kuffner will have access to the necessary experimental systems, equipment and expertise\r\n***.\r\n\r\n",
