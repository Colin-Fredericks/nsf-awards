University of Washington, Seattle\r\nTowards Practical, Expressive Multimethods\r\n\r\nOne of the promises of object-oriented programming is the development of highly reusable and extensible software components, but traditional object-oriented languages have fundamental limitations that hinder the attainment of this goal.  Multimethods, as found in a few object-oriented languages, offer several advantages in uniformity, flexibility, reusability, and extensibility.  However, multimethod in current languages suffer from several weaknesses compared to traditional object-oriented languages, including a lack of modular approaches to static typechecking, a lack of strong encapsulation  mechanisms, and poorer run-time performance for message dispatching.  This project seeks to solve these problems.  A flexible model for\r\ndispatching is being developed that subsumes single dispatching, multiple dispatching, and functions defined by pattern-matching, along with a classless object model and a static type system.  A module system is being added to this base, to provide encapsulation and to define the units of separate static typechecking.  New implementation techniques for efficient message dispatching are also being developed.  To assess this research, the design is being embodied into both a small core language suitable for theoretical study (named Dubious) and an extended language suitable for practical programming (named Diesel), and the Vortex optimizing compiler infrastructure is being modified to include the new dispatching algorithms.\r\n",
