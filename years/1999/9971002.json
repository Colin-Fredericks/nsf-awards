 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the mechanism of Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is the focus of this research project.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Alan Campion and his coworkers at the University of Texas are carrying out studies which probe the detailed mechanism of the SERS effect.  Based on an observation that suggests a connection between charge transfer excitations in adsorbate species and a resonance enhancement mechanism for the Raman spectrum, Campion is exploring this chemical enhancement effect.  A series of molecular adsorbates probing various aspects of this charge transfer mechanism are being examined.  In addition, surfaces with controlled, characterizable atomic scale roughness are being examined, in order to probe the physical aspects of the enhancement mechanism.  A detailed understanding of the SERS process is likely to increase the widespread use of this method for the quantitative molecular analysis of adsorbed layers on surfaces.\r\n\r\nIn order for Raman spectroscopy to be a useful analytical probe of surface structure, a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms of surface enhancement must be obtained.  This research project focuses on the development of this understanding, by probing the effects of charge transfer excitation in adsorbed species on the surface enhancement process.  Coupled with a systematic study of other factors contributing to the surface enhancement effect, the understanding gained should enable a broader use of this important structural probe. \r\n\r\n",
