The first, joint work\r\nwith Bruce Kleiner, considers infinite groups G acting\r\ncocompactly on nonpositively curved spaces H (in the sense of\r\nAlexandrov), and treats the relationship between the geometry of\r\nH and the induced action of G on the ideal boundary of H.  This\r\ncan be considered an aspect of geometric group theory and is\r\npartially motivated by some questions of Gromov. The other theme,\r\ninvolving Kleiner and Sharafutdinov as coauthors (on different\r\naspects), is the study of rigidity theorems (i.e. metric\r\nuniqueness) on compact manifolds.  Here for example we consider\r\nisospectral problems: to what extent must spaces with the same\r\nspectra (e.g. eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami operator, or\r\nlengths of closed geodesics) be isometric.  This also includes\r\nquestions about metric rigidity induced by conjugacy of geodesic\r\nflows, as well as inverse scattering problems.\r\n\r\nThe second theme of the project concerns the question of whether\r\na space can be determined by a certain set of data.  One part of\r\nthis relates to questions of remote sensing.  For example: can\r\nyou determine the density of an object (say a persons body or the\r\nmoon) from measurements taken \"from the outside\"?  The CAT scan\r\nis a practical example where one determines the mass density of\r\nan object from measurements of the total mass along straight\r\nlines.  An alternative set of measurements is the set of times it\r\ntakes for sound to travel between any two points on the boundary\r\n(this is a special case of the boundary rigidity question dealt\r\nwith in the proposal).  The thrust of the proposed study is to\r\ndetermine under which circumstances certain sets of data\r\n(e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of closed geodesics, distances between\r\nboundary points) are sufficient to completely determine the\r\ngeometry of the spaces in question.  Groups show up naturally as\r\nsymmetries of various spaces.  The first theme of this project\r\nconcerns a class of infinite groups which are symmetries of\r\nHadamard spaces H (which include spaces of nonpositive\r\ncurvature.)  As such they induce symmetries on a natural\r\nboundary, B, of H.  Bruce Kleiner and the PI have found an\r\nunexpected relationship between the action of the group on B and\r\nthe geometry of H.  It had been suspected that in this setting\r\nthat the action on B would be determined only by the nature of\r\nthe group (as is the case in the related setting of hyperbolic\r\ngroups acting on negatively curved spaces).  This study intends\r\nto determine the precise nature of this relationship and use it\r\nto study properties of the group and space.\r\n",
