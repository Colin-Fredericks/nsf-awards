 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of its growth in size, scope, and complexity --- as well as its increasingly central role in society --- the Internet has become an important object of study and evaluation.  Many significant innovations in the networking community in recent years have been directed at obtaining a more accurate understanding of the fundamental behavior of the complex system that is the Internet.  These innovations have come in the form of better models of components of the system, better tools which enable us to measure the performance of the system more accurately, and new techniques coupled with performance evaluation which have delivered better system utilization.  The continued development and improvement of our understanding of the properties of the Internet is essential to guide designers of hardware, protocols, and applications for the next decade of Internet growth.\r\n  As a research community, an important next step would involve an introspective look at the challenges that lie ahead in this area.  This would entail an assessment of the progress that has been made to date, an evaluation of both the unsolved challenges and the challenges that the Internet will present us with in the near future, and a discussion of the promising new techniques that innovators in the field are currently developing.  To this end, the Networking Research Group at Boston University propose a one-day workshop with this agenda to be held at Boston University on Monday, August 30, 1999 and which will immediately precede SIGCOMM '99.\r\n  The BU/NSF Internet Measurement, Instrumentation and Characterization(IMIC) workshop will feature four sessions: (1) Modeling and Characterization; (2) Internet Instrumentation and Measurement; (3) End-to-End Protocols and Services; (4) Network Support for Next Generation Internet Applications.  Each session will consist of 3 presentations to be followed by an open discussion.  The workshop will conclude with a panel of researchers from academia and industry, as well as representatives from funding agencies, who will discuss opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, and initiatives to be undertaken.  Proceedings of the workshop will be made available on-line as an NSF report.\r\n",
