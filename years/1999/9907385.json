 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is focused on coping with \"ignorance\" in interactions among electronic agents -- when information is unavailable, uncertain or incorrect -- intentionally or otherwise.  Constraint computation technology is used to model three important electronic community interactions: competition, cooperation, and consultation, and to manipulate information so as to cope with ignorance among elements of the community.  Such coping skills are required for interaction in electronic communities under fully realistic conditions. For example, negotiating agents may need to deal with their ignorance of each other's priorities.  For privacy or proprietary reasons, \r\nagents may wish to reveal as little as possible about their priorities. The development of different strategies that provide the best balance of privacy and openness for different needs is a key research issue. The following specific questions are addressed: \r\n  - How can agents compromise to work together despite differing desires, which they may not wish to reveal? \r\n  - How can agents cooperate to overcome individual limitations when they do not wish to allow unrestricted access to each other?\r\n  - How can unarticulated requirements be elicited from people or other agents in an effective and unobtrusive manner? \r\n\r\n\r\n",
