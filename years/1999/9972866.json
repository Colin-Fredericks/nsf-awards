 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator, a Professor of Statistics, will engage in an intensive study program in the areas of digital signal and image processing and automatic object recognition in remotely sensed images.  Some of the key mathematical tools in these areas, namely, Bayesian hierarchical analysis, spatial modeling, statistical pattern recognition, and information theory, are within the realm of the PI's expertise.  However, a \r\nproductive interdisciplinary research collaboration between any two disciplines requires each researcher to have a basic knowledge of the other area. This grant will allow the PI to attend courses and symposia to\r\nbetter understand signal measurement processes (radar systems, GPS systems and other remote-sensing technologies), and to learn technical terminology in these areas. The PI will conduct regular discussions with faculty in the Information Processing Systems (IPS) Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, in order to develop a long-term interdisciplinary research agenda for Automatic Target Recognition technologies. The PI will also interact regularly with researchers at the Ohio State University's Center for Mapping (CFM) in order to develop an understanding of technical issues in automatic interpretation of geographic images. This IGMS grant is expected to prepare the PI to be a highly effective interdisciplinary\r\nresearcher in these areas, all of which are critical inputs to future high tech developments. The PI considers the long-term involvement with Engineering faculty as an opportunity to identify problems related to\r\nprobability/statistics education for undergraduate and graduate students in engineering, and vice-versa. He plans to work with the IPS faculty to develop relevant courses in order to facilitate interdisciplinary research between future researchers in these two disciplines.  This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
