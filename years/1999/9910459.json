 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the continuance of the highly successful \"NSF-Catalyzed Innovations in the Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory\" symposia that have been held at the Fall Meetings of the American Chemical Society.  Since 1985, the College Science Instrumentation Program (CSIP), the Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) program, and the current Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program have funded a variety of projects to improve the laboratory equipment, and hence, laboratory instruction at colleges and universities throughout the United States and its Territories.  In 1987, the National Science Foundation first sponsored the symposium \"NSF-Catalyzed Innovations in the Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory\" at the Fall Meeting of the American Chemical Society.  Symposia have been held annually since this time and are now well established and attended by both recipients of grants and scientists concerned with their own laboratories who wish to incorporate changes and improvements into their curricula.  These symposia provide the opportunity to disseminate the results of the best projects and to provide a dialog between educators.",
