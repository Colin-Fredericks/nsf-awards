The nucleation and growth of the particles will be studied by stopped-flow spectroscopy.  Parameters which affect mean size and polydispersity will be investigated.  This data will be essential to extend the method to \"shell-core\" bi-metal particle synthesis and large scale flow synthesis.  The reductions will be extended to higher order phases, specifically binary non-oxide ceramics.  This work will be part of a program of strong integration of research and coursework in materials chemistry for undergraduates.  Additionally, the PI will begin to develop a more unified approach to Physical Chemistry laboratory, in which experiments are strongly linked within the context of the lab and with the lecture to provide continuity of learning.  Senior undergraduates interested in chemical education will help design and implement the course.  Finally, the PI will continue his active role as a Freshman Workshop leader, mentoring students prior to their choice of major, easing the transition to college and putting a \"human\" face on science.\r\n%%%\r\nAlkalide/electride reduction is an uniquely powerful method of synthesizing nanomaterials, general across the entire periodic table.  This homogeneous solution phase method overcomes the slow interdiffusion typical of solid state synthesis at ambient and below, and thus is not limited to high temperature, thermodynamic phases.  The research proposed here promises not only to make technologically important materials in the short term, but the methodology developed may open the door to a vast array of as yet undiscovered novel metastable and low temperature thermodynamically stable materials.\r\n***\r\n",
