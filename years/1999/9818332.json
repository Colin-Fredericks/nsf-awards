The video analysis and reconstruction project seeks to develop distributed real-time approaches to large-scale video and image based problems.  The project utilizes three component platforms connected by a high-speed computer network: an active sensor platform, a distributed high performance computing environment, and a flexible real-time display system.  The overall goal of sensing, reconstructing, and visualizing an environment in real-time leads to several specific problems that require the use of one or more of the platforms.  The active sensor platform allows investigation of sensor control and issues in the compression and communication of large-scale image data.  Typically, datasets may contain thousands of images of a complex environment.  A high-performance computing platform, in conjunction with sophisticated computer vision algorithms, is necessary for the reconstruction of these environments in real-time.  The flexible\r\ndisplay system enables research in the visualization of synthetic environments.  Sophisticated user interaction with the model can lead to model improvement by the communication of user-indicated errors from the visualization platform to the sensor platform for the acquisition of new data, or to the compute server, for reprocessing of the data in light of the new information.  This real-time interaction between platforms is facilitated via the high-speed network.",
