 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805272\r\nSchmidt\r\n\r\nIn this project the properties of three classes of ferroelectric (FE) materials. will be investigated.  They include  proton glasses and related crystals, relaxor ferroelectrics, and titanyl ferroelectrics.  Proton glasses and related H-bonded crystals show such phenomena as ergodicity, proton tunneling, phase coexistence, and fast ion conductivity.  The titanyl family, prominent because of excellent second harmonic generation properties, has questions concerning FE domains and one-dimensional conductivity, while relaxor ferroelectrics (crystals with unlike-valence cations randomly located at appropriate sites) pose problems relating to partly or fully suppressed FE transitions.  Different materials belonging to any one of these three categories will be investigated.  Specific studies involve the use of various techniques such as,  calorimetry, quadrupole-perturbed nuclear magnetic resonance, atomic force microscopy, Raman and Brillouin spectroscopy and optical measurements, and others.  The research benefits from the participation  of a large number of collaborators who bring additional experimental and theoretical expertise to this project.  Among the benefits that will result from this research are improved understandings of the behaviors of a large variety of ferroelectric materials. This will facilitate their incorporation in advanced technological devices.  Graduate students and post doctoral research associates will receive training in an technologically important area with exceptional employment opportunities in the 21st Century.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is a fundamental study of crystalline ferroelectric materials. The research is conducted with graduate students, post doctoral research associates and external collaborators.  The benefits accruing from this project will be new, improved technological devices. Students and post doctoral research associates will receive excellent training in an area with  exceptional employment opportunities during the 21st Century.\r\n**\r\n",
