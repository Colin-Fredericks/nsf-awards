 "awd_abstract_narration": "9902185 \r\nWolf \r\nFluorine is a minor yet important gas emitted from many volcanoes.  Its emission indicates that the molten rock, or magma, within the volcano contains but is slowly losing its fluorine.  It is important for us to learn about fluorine in volcanic systems because the presence of this element in magmas affects a wide variety of fundamental parameters such as the viscosity, density and polymerization of the magma; the ability of other elements to bond within and diffuse through the magma; the conditions under which many minerals crystallize or melt; and the distribution of other elements between coexisting crystal, liquid and gas phases.  Such knowledge is of great value in determining the ability of fluorine to act as a flux and mineralizer during the formation of granite-associated magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits if we know more about the effects of fluorine on ore deposition, then we just may be able to use this information to help us find future ore deposits.  One problem with this optimistic scenario, however, is that we need to know the fluorine content of the magma, but how can we do so if most of the fluorine was lost from the crystallizing magma before it solidified into rock?  We can do so because certain minerals that grow in the magma incorporate fluorine into their structures and do not subsequently lose it.  By measuring the fluorine content of these minerals, we may be able to determine the fluorine content of the magma from which these minerals grew.  However, we can only do so if we know how much fluorine these minerals \"sucked up\" relative to the amount of fluorine in the coexisting magma (this parameter is called the distribution or partition coefficient), and we can only determine this parameter by doing experiments.  Thus, in a series of high pressure and high temperature experiments simulating conditions beneath volcanoes, we will grow a variety of different fluorine-bearing minerals from a range of magma compositions to determine the fluorine contents in the coexisting phases, the corresponding distribution coefficients, and, when applied to real rocks, how much fluorine was in the magma initially and how much was lost.  \r\n",
