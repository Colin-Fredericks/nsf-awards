These include ion balance, the storage of hormones, the regulation of cell pH, bone formation, oxidative phosphorylation, and organelle biogenesis. Among the transport ATPases systems discussed are those which have been extensively studied, like the Na/K ATPase, the calcium ATPases, and the proton ATPases, and those which have come into the limelight only in recent years, e.g., the ABC transporter superfamily of ATPases, and the copper transporting ATPases. The focus will be on the newest developments at the cutting edge of transport ATPase research, which will include much work in progress that is still unpublished. The meeting is designed to have a good mixture of lectures, discussion, and poster presentations, which will include established investigators, junior investigators commencing their careers, and postdoctoral fellows and graduate students working in the field. The co-chairman of the meeting are Ernesto Carafoli, Professor, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland, and Peter Pedersen, Professor, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.\r\n     \r\nThis conference brings together junior, mid-career, and senior investigators from throughout the world, and a number of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in the U.S. Transport ATPase are proteins that are located in the membranes of animal, plant, and bacterial cells. They help move nutrients into and out of cells and subcellular compartments.  Significantly, moving (transporting) requires energy.  In biological systems this energy is stored in a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). When ATP binds to the transport protein it releases its energy which helps drive the nutrients into cells and their compartments and other substances out of their compartments and out of the cells. There are many types of nutrients that living cells need to survive.  Therefore, some transport ATPases may transport sodium, others calcium, and still others phosphate. The meeting is designed to have a good mixture of lectures, discussion, and Poster presentations. The experiments to be discussed have considerable relevance to agriculture, e.g. to increasing crop yields and to improving animal nutrition. \r\n\r\n",
