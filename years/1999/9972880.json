The research is multidisciplinary and  will be carried out collaboratively:  synthesis led by the PI, charge transport studies by the Co-PI, and charge transport theory in collaboration with E. Conwell(U. Roch.). The project involves development of synthetic methodology and new materials, structural and morphological characterization of those materials, measurements of charge mobilities, trap depths and densities and development of a theoretical framework in which to evaluate and understand experimental results. Focus is on well-defined oligomeric materials because separation of energetic and morphological disorder, as well as control of purity, is deemed more tractable in these materials than in their polymeric analogs. Materials to be studied include: a)a series of sidegroup substituted thienylenevinylene oligomers with both different conjugation lengths and with fixed conjugation length but varying sidegroup; b)an analogous set of phenylenevinylene oligomers; c)unsubstituted thiophene oligomers with varying conjugation length. Measurements to be performed in these materials include: a)thin-film organic transistor and time-of-flight photoconductivity measurements of hole mobility versus temperature and electric field; b)mobility measurement versus deliberate impurity incorporation. [One type of impurity to be studied is low HOMO-LUMO gap oligomers mixed into high gap oligomers to simulate energetic disorder. Another is molecular oxygen to understand its previously observed effect on transport in sexithiophene.]; c)thermally stimulated current measurements of shallow trap energy distributions; d)systematic variation of thin-film transistor geometry to better understand what factors other than carrier mobility contribute to their current-voltage characteristics. Theoretical work includes: a)incorporation of energetic disorder and spatial correlation into the polaronic theory of transport in organic crystals forwarded by Kenkre; b)theoretical consideration of impurity and interface scattering which can explain relatively weak temperature dependence at low temperatures in organic thin-film transistors; and c)quantitative accounting of the field dependence of mobility\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of organic materials based photonic devices. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the perform-ance of advanced display devices and systems.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.\r\n***\r\n",
