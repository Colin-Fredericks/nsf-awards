 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Awash National Park, situated in the Rift Valley of central Ethiopia, is home to a  unique population of  hybrid baboons.  This population is the outcome of a geographic overlap between the widespread olive baboon (Papio hamadryas anubis) and the semi-desert dwelling hamadryas baboon (Papio h. hamadryas).  Although these two baboon \"forms\" have very different morphological features, ecological preferences, and social structures, when contact allows it, they produce fertile hybrid offspring.   Such  hybrid zones  may be seen as natural laboratories in which to examine relative hybrid   fitness and to investigate whether barriers to gene flow exist . \r\n\r\nThe researchers will evaluate the relative fitness of female hybrid baboons by  observing behavior and its hormonal consequences.  Behaviors will be systematically recorded to determine 1) the nature of female competition, 2) the costs incurred by such behavior, and 3) the extent to which each female's behavior resembles that of the parental forms. The target group is a highly hybridized group which, according to a recent survey of population specific genetic markers, exhibits approximately equal proportions of females with both anubis and hamadryas ancestry.  Close monitoring of ovarian hormones will be used to indicate instances of abnormal reproductive physiology otherwise hidden to an observer, such as failure to ovulate, failure to conceive, or pregnancy loss.  Cortisol and testosterone will also be monitored in the context of behavioral observations to examine the physiological costs associated with competition and aggression. The project thus addresses how  behavior  may be affected by heritage, in turn influencing physiology and reproductive outcome in the hybrid zone.\r\n",
