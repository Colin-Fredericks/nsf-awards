 "awd_abstract_narration": "Award Abstract - 9970205\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Institute of Ecosystem Studies' (IES) Analytical Laboratory (AL) is a shared resource: on average 80% of its scientific staff use the AL facilities for analysis of ecological samples, ranging from precipitation and throughfall to soils and saline waters.  Growth and increased activity over the past several years have put tremendous pressure on the AL  to process accurately, rapidly and as inexpensively as possible samples from a wide variety of ecosystems whose chemical concentrations vary by several orders-of-magnitude.   The AL currently performs between 50,000 and 60,000 analyses a year for major inorganic and organic ions, including sample analysis for many of IES's 30 (currently funded) National Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored projects.  These projects include PIs from IES as well as collaborators outside.  Extensive postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate (through an NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates grant) student research is also done in the AL.\r\nAs a result of this award, IES will improve significantly its analytical capabilities by replacing a liquid scintillation counter that was purchased in 1985, and adding an ion chromatograph, which will be dedicated to cation analysis, to the existing laboratory instrumentation. A new scintillation counter and computer will reduce the necessity for transcription and allow storage and access of data that are at the core of several research programs.  The purchase of an ion chromatograph dedicated to cation analysis will relieve pressure on existing instruments and allow investigators to analyze five+ cations on a small volume of sample at a lower cost and less technician time than is currently possible.\r\n",
