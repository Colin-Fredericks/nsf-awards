 "awd_abstract_narration": "BIOCOMPLEXITY: Collaborative Research: Factors affecting, and impact of,\r\ndiazotrophic microorganisms in the western Equatorial Atlantic Ocean\r\n\r\n\tThis biocomplexity research focuses on plankton dynamics in the western Equatorial Atlantic Ocean (WEQAT).  This is a complex and understudied ecosystem that has significant impacts on marine resources\r\nin the region as well as in downstream areas such as the Caribbean Sea. The study centers on\r\ndiazotrophic (nitrogen fixing) microorganisms as keystone species. Geological, physical, biological,\r\nchemical and even social factors all have a major influence on population biology and activity of\r\ndiazotrophs in the WEQAT. Diazotrophs in turn have a major impact on other phytoplankton and\r\ntrophic levels through input of fixed nitrogen (N). The Amazon River affects the region\r\nphysically by changing salinity and thereby water column stratification, and geochemically by\r\nintroducing iron and silicate which can then biologically stimulate the growth of diatoms that\r\ncontain the N2 fixing endosymbiont Richelia intracellularis. Furthermore, the area receives\r\nsignificant seasonal atmospheric inputs of iron in dust from the Sahel region of Africa, which can\r\npromote the growth of the important N2 fixing cyanobacterium Trichodesmium. This\r\natmospheric iron source is directly deposited on the surface waters where biological activity is\r\ngreatest. For Trichodesmium, the physical environment (e.g. high wind speed) can also inhibit\r\nactivity and the formation of blooms. Diazotrophs may be affected by land use practices in the\r\nAmazon Basin and the African Sahel, and N2 fixed by marine plankton can affect humans by\r\nstimulating primary productivity and fishery yields.\r\n\tUsing both remote sensing and shipboard measurements, scientists will examine the complex processes which structure these planktonic diazotroph populations, influence their importance in CO2 and\r\nN2 fixation, which, in turn, affect other planktonic processes. The seasonal and spatial\r\nrelationships of Trichodesmium and Hemiaulus / Richelia associations will be examined with\r\ndirect reference to the major routes of inputs of Fe and Si, and with regard to the physical\r\nenvironment. The group of collaborating scientists will examine the trophic structures associated with each diazotrophic community, including the vertical distribution of processes and associated autotrophic and\r\nheterotrophic plankton populations. These data will be used to develop and verify\r\nbiogeochemical and trophodynamic models that incorporate the complex physical, chemical and\r\nbiological interactions that characterize the WEQAT region. The models will, in turn, be used to\r\nexamine the hypothesis that physical forcing, through its effect on the diazotrophic populations\r\nand the structure of the food web, influences N2 fixation and, in part, determines the high\r\nproductivity of the WEQAT.\r\n\tThe work uses a combination of both observations and models to address three\r\nfundamental issues in biocomplexity: 1) the relationship between ecosystem structure and\r\nfunction in a system that is both nonlinear and high-dimensional; 2) the response of a nonlinear\r\necosystem to environmental forcing; and 3) the relevant level of detail, including the resolution\r\nof physical space, that must be incorporated in nonlinear systems to capture the dynamics of a\r\nglobal ecosystem property (here, high productivity).  The research will significantly advance our understanding of the interaction between physical and biogeochemical processes in an important area the world's oceans, and identify how these interactions regulate variability in marine ecosystem productivity.\r\n",
