 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall aim of this research is to understand how a simple\r\neukaryote distinguishes itself from many other nonselves in regulating\r\nmating and development.  A specific objective is to elucidate the molecular\r\nmechanism by which the B mating-type genes trigger sexual development in\r\nthe wood rotting mushroom Schizophyllum commune.   The B genes are in two\r\nlinked loci, Ba and Bb, each of which has nine different versions, or\r\nspecificities, in the world-wide population.  A mating pair must be\r\ndifferent at either Ba or Bb to be compatible.  Analyses of  two specificities of\r\neach locus has revealed genes for pheromones and pheromone receptors similar\r\n to those found in other fungi.  Each locus contains a single pheromone\r\nreceptor gene and several pheromone genes.  This multiplicity of pheromone\r\nand receptor genes appears to be unique to the higher basidiomycete fungi.\r\nMolecular analyses to date indicate that as few as one or two amino\r\nacid changes in either a pheromone or receptor molecule can be correlated\r\nwith a switch in mate recognition and signaling of sexual.  The proposed\r\nresearch is divided into three parts:  1) A comprehensive comparison of\r\nsequence and function for a variety of natural and previously generated\r\nmutant variants of pheromones and receptors to identify amino acid residues\r\nin positions relevant to pheromone/receptor interactions.  2) Test the\r\neffects of substituting various amino acids at specific sites that could be\r\nrelevant to pheromone/receptor recognition for each type of molecule, using\r\nthe methods of site-directed mutagenesis and DNA-mediated transformation in\r\nS. commune.  3) Exploit a recently assembled heterologous\r\npheromone-response reporter system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to\r\ngenerate new mutant variants of S. commune pheromones and receptors and\r\nefficiently characterize their effects on ligand/receptor interaction.     \r\n",
