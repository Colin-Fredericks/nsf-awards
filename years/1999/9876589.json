 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project TEACH (Teacher Education Alliance of Colleges and High Schools) is a new teacher preparation program centered at Green River Community College linking high schools, community colleges, and university undergraduate programs.  Beginning with significant recruitment programs which target underrepresented populations, and collaborating with Central Washington University, Project TEACH seeks to improve the preparation of future teachers, especially in mathematics and science. The project serves as a reproducible model demonstrating the role that community colleges can play in teacher preparation through the creation of a seamless transition into the teaching profession. The strategies are:\r\n\r\n1.\tTo recruit more talented students into the teaching profession with\r\nrecruitment beginning at the high school level and focusing on underserved populations;\r\n2.\tTo provide practical and diverse preservice field experiences with mentor\r\nteachers utilizing interactive methods of science, math, and technology education;\r\n3.\tTo strengthen mathematics & science in elementary schools through interdisciplinary courses for future teachers that model interactive teaching and active learning;\r\n4.\tTo improve the preparation and retention of prospective teachers through a\r\nnew para-professional certificate and a pre-professional degree in education;\r\n5.\tTo support mentor teachers and beginning teachers through shared inservice opportunities which will facilitate meaningful dialogues and interactions.\r\n\r\n",
