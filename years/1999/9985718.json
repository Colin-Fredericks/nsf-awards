The planning process will lead to an electronic \"Gateway to Undergraduate Biology Education\".  This gateway will provide a mechanism for collaboration of large societies who are developing specific sites and smaller societies that want to dock on the large site.  The meeting will provide an opportunity for input from a broad community of potential developers and users of the site.  It is planned to develop the site in a manner consistent with plans for the Digital Library currently under consideration at NSF.\r\n",
