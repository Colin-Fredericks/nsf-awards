This project is aimed at documenting uplift and unroofing of the Alborz range of northern Iran, which is in the beginning stages of the collision between the Arabian peninsula and Iran which began in Pliocene time.  The work involves structural, magmatic, denudational and uplift history of the Alam Kuh area and associated isotopic geochronology and geochemistry.  Results are expected to shed light on the processes that occur early in continental collision, such as the synchroneity or diachroneity of widespread deformation and uplift following collision.\r\n\r\n",
