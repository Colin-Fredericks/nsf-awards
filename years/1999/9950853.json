 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southwest Missouri State University (SMSU) Department of Chemistry is committed to providing our graduates with a sound background in fundamental areas of chemistry coupled with an understanding of and exposure to modern instrumentation.  Our current project concerns the upgrading of a 200 MHz NMR spectrometer, which was purchased in 1987 with funds from a NSF-ILI grant and matching funds from SMSU.  Through this upgrade, our students have greater data acquisition capabilities and faster data processing.  The system is integrated into the campus network, thereby allowing rapid data transfer to PCs in the computer lab as well as to students in the classrooms.  \r\n\r\nThe use of NMR data transfer and storage methods is adapted from projects published in J. Chem. Ed. that have received prior NSF support (NSF-CHE 8620242 and NSF-BIR 9414026).  In addition, this upgrade allows for greater implementation of laboratory experiences for all chemistry majors including the following published projects in J. Chem. Ed. that have been developed through NSF support (NSF-USE 9151729 and NSF-DUE 9152468).  Over 2000 chemistry students have used the NMR spectrometer in chemistry courses and research over the past ten years.  The transfer of technology from the instrument to another site (computer lab, classroom, or office) is an essential tool for increased usage by faculty and students. \r\n",
