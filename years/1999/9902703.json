The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide support for a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Kirsten C. Sadler to work with Dr. Asli Tolun at Bosphorus University in Istanbul, Turkey.\r\nThe goal of this research is to identify components of the signaling pathway and the motogen receptor in starfish oocytes.  This is important because neither the hormone receptor nor the early signal transduction pathways have identified in any oocyte.  Starfish oocytes have long been used as a model for studying the cell cycle and meiotic maturation.  The oocytes are stored in the ovary arrested in the first meiotic cell cycle and upon stimulation by their natural mitogen, they re-enter the cell cycle and develop fertilization competency.  Conversion of an immature oocyte to a fertilizable egg is termed oocyte maturation.\r\nThe university is located on the Bosphorus and in close proximity to the Sea of Marmara, which is filled with starfish.  In addition, the geographic position of Turkey allows access to the Black Sea, the Aegean and the Mediterranean.  The environments of each are unique and support different species of starfish with different reproductive cycles, providing a unique opportunity to obtain material for comparative studies.  In addition to working with researchers at Bosphorus University, Dr. Sadler will be able to form collaborations with other researchers in Europe, such as Dr. Christain Sardet at Villefranche, France.\r\n***\r\n",
