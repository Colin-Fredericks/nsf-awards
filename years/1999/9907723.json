 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental and Applied Ecology Program (EAEP), which administers the Kansas Ecological Reserves ( KER), proposes to undertake a comprehensive, two-phases planning excercise to guide development of KER over the next 5 years.  To initiate this process, EAEP has identified 3 principal objectives: 1. Increase use of KER facilities for education. 2. Enhance use of KER for experimental ecological research. 3. Create a framework for regional (cross-site) research, by developing partnerships with other field research facilities.  \r\n\r\nThe major activities planned for Phases I will be a strategic planning workshop, and a follow-up review conducted 2-3 months later.  Participants in the workshop will be members of the EAEP faculty advisory group and staff, assisted by experienced workshop facilitators from the University of Kansas Institute for Public Policy and Business Research (IPPBR).  IPPBR staff have developed a workshop format specifically intended for interdisciplinary research groups such as EAEP.  The product of the workshop will be a draft strategic plan for KER which will be reviewed by the group and relevant administrators at the second meeting.  The final product of Phase I will be a long-term strategic plan for KER.  A task group will be formed to advise and assist the director of EAEP in preparations for Phase II of the planning exercise.\r\n\r\nDuring Phase II EAEP will develop specific plans for implementation of the strategic goals, focused on a 5-year time frame.  The major activities in Phase II will include one or two large workshop meetings.  Participants in this meeting (or meetings) will include the EAEP advisory group, plus individuals from institutions other than KU.  Depending upon decisions made in Phase I, researchers from other universities, state or local officials, and representatives of federal agencies, non-profit organizations, or the business community may be invited.  Issues to be covered in these meetings will include: Detailing and setting 5-year priorities within the framework of the strategic plan for KER; identifying funding opportunities that could enable these goals; and discussing procedures for coordination and cooperation among an expanded community of potential users of KER facilities.  Particular effort will be made to include individuals who have had experience developing field research facilities at other institutions.\r\n\r\nThe final product of Phase II will be a detailed, comprehensive plan for KER facilities development for the next 5 years, and agreements for cooperation with field research facilities at other institutions \r\n",
