 "awd_abstract_narration": "Higher plants initiate new organs (e.g., leaves) throughout their\r\nlife.  Thus they face two problems.  Plants must maintain a pool of\r\nundifferentiated cells from which to draw upon for organ initiation, and\r\nmust balance the proliferation of these undifferentiated cells and their\r\nincorporation into organ primordia.  In other words, given a constant\r\nnumber of undifferentiated cells, the cell division rate of the\r\nundifferentiated cells must equal the rate at which these cells are\r\ndirected toward organ formation.  These processes occur at a structure\r\ntermed a meristem.  In the plant embryo, two meristems are established:\r\nthe root meristem, which will give rise to the root system, and the shoot\r\nmeristem, which will give rise to the above-ground portion of the plant.\r\nAt the growing tip of the shoot meristem, cells in the very center are\r\nmaintained in an undifferentiated state, while cells surrounding this\r\ncentral region are directed toward organ formation.  The goal of the\r\nproposed research is to provide a better understanding of the genes and\r\nprocesses directing organ formation at the shoot meristem.  While the\r\nproposed project is basic science, any applied projects to alter the\r\nnumber, spatial patterning or identity of plant organs will require an\r\nunderstanding of the shoot meristem.\r\n     The CLAVATA loci (CLV1, CLV2, CLV3) function in the same pathway\r\nto promote organ formation at the shoot and flower meristem based on\r\nloss-of-function phenotypes.  The CLV1 and CLV2 genes have been cloned and\r\nappear to code for receptors involved in signal transduction.  During the\r\nprevious funding period the CLV1 gene was isolated and its expression\r\npattern, which is tightly restricted to the shoot and flower meristem, was\r\ndetermined.  CLV1 becomes ectopically expressed in mutants that develop\r\nectopic or enlarged meristems.  Constitutive expression of CLV1 by the 35S\r\npromoter was not possible, apparently due to the toxicity of CLV1 during\r\nearly stages of development.  CLV1 could be expressed, however, under\r\ncontrol of the flower-specific AP1 promoter, and this rescues the clv1\r\nmutant phenotype, but does not affect wild-type development.  It was also\r\ndetermined that the primary defect in clv1 and clv3 mutants is in organ\r\nformation, not cell division.  Analysis of clv2 mutants revealed that CLV2\r\nregulates both meristem and organ development.  CLV2 functions in the same\r\npathway as CLV1/CLV3 to regulate meristem development, but in a separate\r\npathway to regulate organ development.  The requirement for CLV2 is very\r\nsensitive to physiological conditions.  Mutations in a number of novel\r\nregulators of meristem development were isolated.\r\n     The goal in the current funding period is to generate inducible\r\nectopic activation of CLV1.  This will allow questions of CLV1 function to\r\nbe addressed, and will allow the characterization of potential targets of\r\nCLV1 signal transduction.  The process of suppression of clv2 flower\r\nphenotypes under short day photoperiod conditions will be investigated.\r\nThe investigations will determine whether this is a response to day length\r\nor growth rates, and what genes are involved.  CLV2 will be expressed\r\nunder various tissue-specific and inducible promoters to address questions\r\nof CLV2 function.  Finally, a mutation in a novel regulator of meristem\r\ndevelopment, corona (cor), will be studied.  The cor mutant was identified\r\nas a strong enhancer of the clv1 organ formation defect.  cor clv1-1\r\ndouble mutants completely lose the ability to initiate new organ primordia\r\nshortly after the transition to flowering.  Preliminary genetic evidence\r\nsuggest that COR promotes organ formation in a separate pathway from the\r\nCLV loci.\r\n",
