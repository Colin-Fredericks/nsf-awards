 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research completes a cross-national comparative study of tropical land conflicts in Belize, Guatemala and Mexico, examining land policies by governmental institutions as they apply to tropical forest conservation and Mayan customary practices. The study differentiates national and indigenous land tenure systems and the social pressures bearing on them. Knowledge of the linkages between land tenure conflicts, ethnic vitality and environmental factors inform the particular forms of conservation management chosen by individual governments. Two weeks will be spent at the Land Tenure Center Library at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, followed by a six month field investigation in four Mexican states, Belize and Guatemala. The research consists of interviews, historical documentation, and the development of case studies in Mexico and Guatemala. Interviewees will include representatives from national governments, local offices, non-governmental organizations, socio-political organizations, and individuals operating as farmers, natural resource workers, and indigenous leaders. Historical and legal research will occur at universities in four tropical Mexican states and at archives in Belize, completing fifteen months of previous field investigation.",
