The Center, headquartered at Eastern Michigan University, is operated jointly by the University and North Dakota State University.  The primary objective of the present project is to develop well-documented acrylic polymers that can be formulated into artist paints with better durability than those in use today.  Associated objectives are to better understand how polymer structure and paint formulation affect long-term durability of artist paints, to develop analytical and test protocols for latex-based paint durability, and to initiate long-term testing of well-documented benchmark paints.  The project will focus on artist paints made from acrylic latex polymers, the largest market segment.  The polymers currently used in such paints are acrylic latexes that were designed for other, larger-scale uses, typically for exterior house paints.  Unlike previous studies of artist paints, this project will use latexes whose synthesis procedures and compositions are well documented, laying a foundation for future research.  The project will be effected in four or five overlapping stages with close coordination among Golden and Center researchers.  The stages are (1) synthesis of all-acrylic latexes, formulation of paints, and comparison with contemporary commercial acrylic latexes using conventional test methods, (2) analysis of paints and development of test protocols for detecting early change in artist paints, comparing experimental latexes with commercial latexes, (3) optimization of benchmark latexes and formulations for artist paints, (4) scale-up and distribution of an optimized latex and paints for long-term testing, and (5), if time permits, exploration of alternative approaches to artist paints.  The project will benefit the Center by expanding its research capacity and aiding member recruitment.  It will benefit Golden Artist Colors by improving product quality and enlarging its markets\r\n",
