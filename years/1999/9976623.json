 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wealth of studies in adults suggests that acetylcholine (a chemical in the brain) plays an important role in cognitive processes such as spatial learning and memory.  Considerably less is known about the role that acetylcholine plays in the developing mammal, and how this chemical may help to establish the complex neural circuitry that will underlie cognitive processes later in life.  The proposed study will explore the role of acetylcholine in early postnatal development in rat by examining how cognitive processes develop in the absences of this chemical.  Furthermore, the proposed study will examine how other neurochemical systems may compensate for the loss of acetylcholine.  This neurochemical compensation is one form of neuroplasticity (remodeling/ dynamic changes) in the nervous system that is a hallmark of the developmental process.  All of the proposed studies will be conducted in rats of both sexes to determine whether the two sexes respond similarly to developmental manipulations.\r\nThis study will provide new insights into the role of an important neurochemical in the maturation of the brain and behavior.  The study should also provide insights into how a developing mammal responds behaviorally to changes in the neurochemical environment, as well as insights into the types of compensations that are made in response to these changes. \r\n",
