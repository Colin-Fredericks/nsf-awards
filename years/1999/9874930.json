 "awd_abstract_narration": "9874930\r\nEllman\r\nMuch of the research in this CAREER project relies on the use of high-frequency phonons as incisive probes of unconventional superconductor (e.g., heavy fermion) gap structures.   Transverse ultrasound is exceptionally suited to studies of symmetry-breaking in, for example, UPt3 under uniaxial stress, while higher frequency non-hydrodynamic phonons will be utilized in an attempt to directly \"map the gaps\" in k-space.  Even higher energy phonons (~200 GHz) will be used to study Ising magnets possessing a \"tunable\" degree of disorder.  Ultimately, the aim will be to spectroscopically explore the onset of glassy behavior in a system eminently amenable to theoretic analysis. The education component incorporates (a) teaching qualitative physics to non-scientists and (b) instilling an appreciation for science as a worthwhile human endeavor.  Two groups will be targeted: (1) Students enrolled in a large non-mathematical physical science course, which may be the only opportunity to broaden their horizons. (2) Parents (or prospective parents) of young children. Here, the goal is to supply information to inform and augment the parents in their roles as role model and teacher. Updated course materials, demonstrations, and modern information technology will bring powerful, highly visual tools to bear on these tasks.\r\n%%% \r\nThis project focuses on magnets and superconductors, which have important technological applications. Ultra-high frequency sound waves are used to probe some of these exotic materials. For superconductors, this technique gives a direct geometric \"picture\" of quantities that dictate the electrical behavior of the material (the superconducting \"gap\").  For magnets, it provides basic information about the often-puzzling roles of disorder and magnetic interaction in otherwise simple systems.
