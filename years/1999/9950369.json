 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a set of web-based tools that students and others will use to examine and understand the dramatic demographic changes that have occurred in New York City from the turn of the century to the present. Exploratory visual and map enabled software tools will use a unique set of materials drawn from data and maps based upon the U.S. and New York State Censuses going back to 1905, which are being computerized as part of a long term project for the New York Times.\r\n\r\nThe tools will allow students to compare and contrast change in specific areas of New York City and among specific groups over a long time period, particularly in the areas of race, ethnic ancestry, family status, housing and income. Exercises that complement these tools will make it possible for students to study their own or another neighborhood in New York City and compare its characteristics with the city as a whole. They will be able to compare the fate of various race, ethnic and other groups over time. The tools will be visually oriented, and students will produce maps and charts that illustrate topics of interest interactively using a web browser. These materials will be pilot tested in a set of courses that focus upon urban, race and ethnic topics. They will then be offered generally \"on the Web.\"\r\n\r\nQueens College and its sociology department is one of the premier producers of primary and secondary school teachers, as well as students who go on to get a Ph.D. in sociology. The department itself has about 900 majors. Its students, who are about 70 percent female, are drawn from the diverse mix of race and ethnic groups who inhabit New York City. Through partnerships with secondary institutions, the tools and exercises will also be developed for use by secondary school students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
