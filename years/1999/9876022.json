 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer simulations and even experimental devices generate more than a\r\nsingle variable.  These variables typically exhibit complex\r\ninterdependencies which must be thoroughly understood to improve the\r\nsimulation codes and understand the complex systems being studied.\r\nUnfortunately, cluttering prevents this from being achieved in current\r\nvisualization systems. Users are thus left with generating several\r\ndifferent representations and mentally merging them together, a nearly\r\nimpossible feat. The goal of this project is to provide new methods that\r\nwill let scientists browse through their terabytes of data searching for\r\ninteresting patterns or irregularities. A secondary component of this\r\nproject is to illustrate the utility of the new technique to the rest of\r\nthe computer graphics industry, including efficient volume rendering for\r\nobjects such as fire, clouds and water. These solutions will bring\r\ncomputational scientists one step closer to a seamless environment for\r\nstudying both multiple simulations and complex interactions within a\r\nsimulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnically, the project will investigate new methods for representing\r\ncomplex vector fields and multi-dimensional scalar fields defined over a\r\nthree-dimensional mesh topology. A particular emphasis will be on extending\r\na direct volume rendering technique known as \"splatting\" to provide\r\nintegrated representations of multiple data variables. (The name comes from\r\na step in the method that constructs a footprint or \"splat\" used to project\r\n3D basis functions onto surface textures.) In particular, this research\r\nwill extend the state-of-the-art in direct volume rendering by developing\r\ntechniques to depict non-homogenous or isotropic volumes.  These volume\r\ntextures will be developed along with efficient rendering techniques to\r\nallow them to reinforce or segregate different regions of a volume,\r\ncontrol representations of time-varying data, and apply the representations\r\nto virtual reality settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
