 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is intended to address student achievement and systemic reform in science and math education.  It approaches the challenge from the unique perspectives of rural communities.  The project will help math and science educators build upon the inherent strengths of rural schools and better understand the factors inherent in rural schools and communities that support or serve as barriers to systemic reform.  This study has four objectives:\r\n1. To develop a system of indicators around each of the identifies six drivers of educational system reform.\r\n2. To determine the perceived relative importance and value of each of the drivers and indicators for reform in RSI schools in selected communities.\r\n3. To determine the status of innovation/reform within selected communities with respect to factors through to support or serve as barriers to innovation and education reform.\r\nTo determine the ways and the extent to which the perceived importance and value of the drivers and the characteristics of the community impact on systemic reform efforts and student achievement in mathematics, science and technology.\r\n",
