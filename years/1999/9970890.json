Specifically, it will try to integrate high-level cognitive modeling and connectionist knowledge representation research with methods from optimal control. Computational, biological, and cognitive data all help us understand the remarkable strengths and limits of human reasoning. These data reveal new computational forms for cognitive systems. Continuing prior research in a neurally motivated model of reflexive inference (SHRUTI) and cognitive models of naturalistic decision making, the PI is developing a new method for a Approximate Dynamic Programming, termed causal-HDP. He utilizes the computational structure of causal models to direcfiy compute multi-step approximations of the Bellman equation during reflexive reasoning. These approximations are supplemented with remembered estimates of the tail of the distribution, as in Adaptive Critic designs. This approach is a hybrid between classical time-backward dynamic programming and incremental, heuristic dynamic programming.\r\n\r\nLimits on computational resources necessitate adaptive attention shifting behaviors, which extend the scope of reflexive inference. Metacognitive skills are developed from attention shifting, and provided for reasoning explicity about uncertainty, as identified in incomplete arguments, unreliable evidence or conclusions, and conflicting goals for evidence. When stakes and time warrant more than reflexive behavior, real decision-makers use such skills to evaluate and improve interpretations and plans. By combining a reflexive reasoner with attention shifting mechanisms, the project will develop systems capable of assembling larger, coherent interpretations and plans and of reasoning with uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThese concepts will be explored within the general framework of causal networks and will include a detailed realization of causal-HDP within SHRUTI. There will be an empirical evaluation of the causal-HDP method, and attention shifting strategies, using the neurally motivated SHRUTI implementation, and evaluate them with both abstract and real world tasks. Finally, the formalism will be mapped onto other research, theorems, and proofs in Approximate Dynamics Programming, and onto other models and data in cognitive psychology. This work should result in an improved understanding of architectures capable of rapid inference and planning, and the metacognitive mechanisms used for reasoning with uncertainty.\r\n***",
