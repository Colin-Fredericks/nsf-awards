 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although some decisions are made on the basis of simple direct\r\nevaluation of \"gut\" feelings, or the utilities of the various\r\nalternatives, many decisions involve conflicting feelings; and the\r\nconflict-resolution process often takes into account evidence about\r\nsome uncertain events.\r\n\r\nA typical example would be the conflict faced by a college student who\r\nhas an important exam the next day but wants to quit studying to\r\nspend some time with friends.  In the process of resolving this\r\nconflict, many students consider the uncertain event that they will do\r\nwell in the exam even if they stop studying now.  Evidence relevant to\r\nthis event includes how difficult the exam is expected to be and how\r\nmuch preparation the student has done all semester in this course.  If\r\nthe exam is only somewhat important, and the evidence leads the student\r\nto feel pretty sure of doing well without further studying, the student\r\nwill probably decide to quit studying.  Even if the exam is highly\r\nimportant, a student who is very sure of doing well will probably\r\nquit studying.\r\n\r\nFor some decisions, part of the evidence consists of estimated\r\nprobabilities derived from scientific models.  A physician may\r\nconsider estimated probabilities of recurrence of cancer before\r\nrecommending therapy, or a homeowner may take account of earthquake\r\nprobabilities in deciding whether to reinforce the foundation.\r\n\r\nThe present research is based on a recently developed theory of\r\ndecision-making under uncertainty.  The core idea is that people\r\ncategorize uncertain events (e.g., \"pretty sure\" or \"very sure\"\r\nof doing well on the exam), and that such categorization is based on\r\nvarious kinds of evidence (sometimes including probabilities\r\nestimated from scientific models).\r\n\r\nThe research has two main branches.  One focusses on decision\r\nsituations involving conflict.  We study how decision rules change,\r\ndepending on value of goals (for example, a student may use a\r\n\"pretty sure\" rule for a somewhat important exam, but a \"very sure\"\r\nrule for a highly important one) and how evidence is used to\r\ncategorize the uncertain events.  Our preliminary findings suggest\r\nthat different evidence weightings are used for different abstract\r\ncategories  of uncertainty.  This part of the research also examines\r\npeople's justifications for their decisions, in order to understand\r\nbetter how justifications relate to actual decision rules underlying\r\nchoices.\r\n\r\nThe second branch of the research focusses on evidence judgment, in\r\nisolation from the ultimate decision--for example, the judgments\r\nthat a detective or a scientist might use in forming or confirming\r\nhypotheses.  We are interested in the difference between initially\r\ngenerating a hypothesis and confirming it; in how people react to\r\nconflicting evidence; in how people use base rates and relative\r\nlikelihoods as evidence; and in the process of selecting relevant\r\nevidence when it is obscured by irrelevancies.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the major goals of the research include testing and\r\ndeveloping a rather new theory of decision making; studying how\r\nscientific probability estimates can be used in policy decisions;\r\nand delineating the differences between exploratory use of evidence\r\nin formulating hypotheses versus hypothesis confirmation.",
