 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award is to support the further development of non-contact methods for the thermal characterization of thin films and the exploration of the utility of this information in sensing critical microstructural properties such as: thermal diffusivity, grain boundary impedance of electron mobility, thermal boundary resistance, electron phonon energy coupling, acoustic velocity, and thickness.  This will be done utilizing a femtosecond pump/probe thermoreflectance technique.  This thin film characterization method relies on the fact that the reflectivity of certain materials is a function of both temperature and strain, and by monitoring the reflective response to the deposition of radiation by an ultrashort laser pulse, the thermal and mechanical properties can be extrapolated simultaneously.  To compliment the empirical approach, several advancements have been made toward a strong theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium heating and the effects on the optical properties of metals and semiconductors and further goals have been set towards making computational processes more efficient.\r\n\r\nThis research promises to impact the manufacturing of high-tech materials and devices of national importance, such as opto-electronics, photo-voltaics, and micro-electronics.  The theories and techniques developed with this program will form the basis for the development of new nondestructive sensor technologies for process monitoring and control.  The proposed work provides an excellent educational environment, by setting goals based in fundamental science with a strong potential impact on industry and by fostering interdisciplinary research teams.  The lab will continue its tradition of uniting students from different backgrounds and experiences into a supportive group research environment.\r\n",
