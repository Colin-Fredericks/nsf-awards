It is jointly supported by the NSF's Office of Polar Programs, the Division of Physics, the Division of Astronomical Sciences, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences.\r\n\tNeutrinos are produced by extremely energetic events in the universe, but interact only weakly with matter and thus require very large detector volumes.  When an interaction does occur, it produces Cerenkov radiation in the visible range which can be tracked from the sequential arrival times of the light burst at different optical modules within the ice.  Critical to the proper analysis and identification of neutrino events is the data acquisition, local signal processing, and information transfer from deep remote sensors to the surface analysis facility which may involve a path length of several kilometers.\r\n\tThe current array of analog optical modules has disadvantages in that dispersion and attenuation degrade the signal quality.  Optical fiber cable would preserve waveform information, but is costly and subject to damage during the installation of the module strings.  These are frozen in the ice to depths of several kilometers and cannot be recovered for repair.\r\nA string of digital optical modules will be robust and reliable, and should provide high quality data from which complex events can be characterized with accurately reconstructed tracks.  Operation of the fully instrumented string will be a cost-effective demonstration of the feasibility of implementing a full-scale neutrino telescope based on state-of-the-art digital system architecture.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n",
