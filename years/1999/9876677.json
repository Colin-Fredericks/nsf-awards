 "awd_abstract_narration": "Key insights into protein structure-function studies and structure-based drug design can be provided by an understanding of how enzyme catalysis is occurring at the enzyme active site. The study of catalysis is at the very core of understanding enzyme function. An understanding of the chemistry, chemical species and the kinetic pathway that takes place within the active site of enzyme holds great promise for describing in detail how enzymes work and more importantly how small molecules might be designed to be more potent drugs i.e. transition state analogs. The major focus of this instrument and methodology we are developing will be in advancing studies of transient intermediates in biochemical reactions (both covalent and non-covalent). In addition, this instrument should find utility in monitoring chemical catalysis and reactions, aiding in protein folding structural and kinetic studies and further validating and characterizing the creation of engineered proteins with novel catalytic functions. This instrument will open up the possibility of studying chemically labile intermediates and new enzyme and protein Systems that otherwise could not be studied. \r\nThis instrument will provide a major advance in methods to study transient enzyme intermediates and will continue the evolution of applying high-resolution mass spectrometry techniques into biology. This area continues to grow in importance as the methods become more powerful, as new enzymes with novel mechanisms become identified, as incorporation of transient kinetic information into drug design increases and as new areas of rapid kinetic investigations such as protein folding emerge. We are, just now, witnessing the power and impact that mass spectrometry will have in the biological sciences. This instrument, which interfaces classical rapid kinetics studies of enzymes with high powered analytical detection, has the possibility of propelling enzymology to a new level.\r\n",
