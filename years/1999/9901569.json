 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chautauqua Program provides an annual series of workshops in which scholars at the frontiers of various science and engineering disciplines meet intensively for several days with undergraduate college science teachers.  These workshops provide an opportunity for invited scholars to communicate new knowledge, concepts, and techniques directly to college teachers in ways which are immediately beneficial to their teaching.  The primary aim is to enable undergraduate teachers in the sciences to keep their teaching current and relevant.   \r\n\r\nThis program is national in scope and will immediately benefit an estimated 2,000 faculty during the next year.  These faculty, in turn, will positively influence more than 350,000 undergraduates enrolled in their courses.  This national program which has a significant impact on the quality of undergraduate programs in both two- and four-year institutions helps to attract and maintain a healthy supply of graduates in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology fields.  It also contributes to empowering all students with scientific and technical literacy and numeracy required for fully effective participation in modern society.  The program is also very cost effective.  \r\n",
