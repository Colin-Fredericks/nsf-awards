 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constraint-based Reasoning is a deductive paradigm that combines the versatility of general-purpose reasoning with the performance of specialized constraint solving. Currently, the full-scale applicability \r\nof constraint-based reasoning is hindered by the difficulty of combining existing constraint solvers, modularly, into more powerful solvers. The few solver combination methods developed so far have limited \r\napplicability because of their stringent requirements on the kind of constraint languages and theories that can be combined. \r\n\r\nThe PI and his collaborators have previously considered the somewhat simpler problem of combining satisfiability procedures and have produced a combination framework as a generalization of Nelson-Oppen combination method to the case of constraint theories sharing function or predicate symbols. The results \r\nof this work has also led to a new combination method for the word problem. Further investigation is needed to make the developed combination method(s) applicable in practice.  This project aims at further investigating the main theoretical and practical issues involved in solver combination in the case of \r\nconstraint theories with non-disjoint signatures. In particular, it aims at:  1) expanding and refining the existing combination framework to address some of its current shortcomings; 2) identifying practical applications of the framework and implementing instances of its combination method for some of these applications; 3) unifying the work on the combination framework above with the one on the combination of decision procedures for the word problem.\r\n",
