 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project advances our understanding of the institutional factors that influence how scarce water resources are developed and allocated across competing uses. The development of the common law of water rights has played a key role in determining how water has come to be allocated throughout the arid American West. The factors that influence court rulings, and the resulting economic consequences, remain imperfectly understood by economists. My recent research into the genesis of water laws in l9th-century California is strongly suggestive that in certain important ways, the courts actively promoted reallocations of water to higher-valued uses as economic growth occurred over time. However, currently we still lack a coherent picture of key economic trends which may have influenced court rulings on water rights. In addition, very little systematic evidence exists regarding the actual effect of these rulings on water use patterns and the creation of institutional arrangements to develop and share water.\r\n\r\n        The objective of the proposed project is to fill these gaps in our understanding by conducting field research in California to collect data on the establishment of water claims, exchanges of land and water, lower court rulings, cross-sectional and temporal patterns in water availability, surface- and groundwater use, and the costs of water production, transportation, and distribution. This would require visits to a number of different county records offices around the state, since during this time period no central agency collected any of this information. One key set of hypotheses involve the extent to which court rulings clarified relative property rights in water, thus reducing transactions costs and encouraging exchanges of water and land. To examine this issue, I would correlate the land and water exchanges in my database with the timing of certain key rulings. Another set of hypotheses concerns how the nature and frequency of conflicts over water affected the propensity of the California supreme court to hand down rulings which changed the direction of the law. Water conflicts will be characterized and quantified using information on lower court cases, the geographic distribution of claims, and trends in water cost and availability. A third set of hypotheses concerns the extent to which conflicts were formally resolved through litigation, as opposed to other means such as out-of-court settlement, avoidance of inflicting damages, and the creation of alternative institutional arrangements. Information on the location and timing of claims could, for example, be used to examine the extent to which claimants tried to avoid inflicting damages rather than risk costly litigation.\r\n",
