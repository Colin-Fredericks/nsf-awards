 "awd_abstract_narration": "Industrial air quality is of growing importance due to the fact that aerosol waste streams generated by manufacturing processes represent a significant health hazard.  Much of this airborne particulate matter can be attributed to cutting fluid mists.  In the absence of cutting fluid (i.e., dry machining), dust particles may be created during machining and become airborne.  Inhalation of these solid particles may pose an even greater health hazard than mist droplets.  The concern over worker exposure to airborne particulates has prompted regulatory scrutiny by several organizations.  Particle concentrations based upon number, surface area, and mass are important metrics for engineering purposes as well as for assessing health impacts.  The equipment associated with this project, an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer Spectrometer, provides measurements based on each of these metrics, thereby giving a complete profile of all important characteristics of the aerosol being sampled.  This device (which measures particles between 0.5 and 20 microns), in conjunction with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (which measures particles less than 0.5 microns), will provide a complete picture of temporal and spatial behavior of the particle sizes that can adversely affect human health.  Plans for use of the Spectrometer (and Particle Sizer) emphasize the characterization of the dominant mechanisms that influence aerosol formation in machining.\r\n     The ultimate goal of the project to develop and validate theoretical aerosol formation models may lead to machining process redesign that minimizes aerosol formation, thereby eliminating or reducing the need for costly machine enclosures and air filters.\r\n",
