The objective of the proposed research is to help developers produce better software.  To achieve this objective, the proposed research combines three important software engineering threads:  system testing, formal methods, and mutation analysis.  System testing consumes considerable resources in commercial projects, but much of the activity is ad-hoc and unformalized.  The proposed research will provide methods to generate system test cases with respect to a given model, and also the means to evaluate existing system test cases.  Formal methods have enjoyed recent success through advances in model checking.  Model checkers are well suited to generating counter examples, which can be interpreted as test cases.  The proposed research will provide mechanisms that generate and evaluate system test cases with respect to a model checking specification.  Mutation analysis is a method to generate and evaluate tests with respect to the ability of the tests to distinguish a given artifact from a series of minor variations, or mutants, of the artifact.  The proposed research seeks to automate mutation analysis for specifications through the use of model checkers. \r\n",
