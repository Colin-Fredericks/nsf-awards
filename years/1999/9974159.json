 "awd_abstract_narration": "9974159\r\nHooper\r\nEcologists have hypothesized for decades that more diverse communities are more difficult for species to invade because greater species richness should leave less available resources for a potential invader to exploit. This research seeks to address three fundamental questions (1) Does diversity influence invasibility of communities? (2) Do functional attributes of invaders related to resource acquisition influence the success of their invasion? (3) Is there a greater probability of invasion success when the invader differs from community members in functional attributes related to resource capture? The experimental design allows separation of effects due to differences in plant composition from effects due to differences in functional group richness. Unlike previous studies that have inferred answers to these questions by surveying communities which have already been invaded, this project will directly test the patterns of invasion into communities that differ in both composition and richness of plant functional groups. It will study the role of competition as a mechanism involved in invasion outcome. The research will use already-established experimental communities in California serpentine grassland. These experimental communities allow control of several factors, including disturbance regime, soil fertility, and community history, which confound attempts to study these questions in already invaded ecosystems. By directly seeding in species that are not already a part of those experimental communities, but that occur in the local area, it also will be possible to control for the rate of propagule arrival. This control is critical for determining what limits the success of an invasion once propagules have arrived. Overall, this set of experiments will provide a direct test of hypotheses concerning community invasibility and its underlying mechanisms.\r\n\r\n",
