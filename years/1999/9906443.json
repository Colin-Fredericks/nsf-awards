 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of the proposed work is to determine the contributions the major input pathways to extrastriate regions of cerebral cortex make to visual perception and cognition.  The two major input pathways are: 1) the geniculate pathway, which transmits visual signals to the thalamus and then primary visual cortex, in order to gain entry to extrastriate cortex, and 2) the midbrain pathway, which transmits signals to the midbrain and then the thalamus, in order to gain entry to extrastriate cortex.  The present study is designed to evaluate the contributions of the midbrain pathway.  To make this evaluation, cooling loops, which induce localized hypothermia, will be placed in contact with the midbrain to effect temporary deactivation.  The contribution to visual processing will be\r\nassessed with a battery of perceptual, cognitive, mnemonic and reflexive tasks which require a behavioral response.\r\nIdentification of specific deactivation-induced deficits in behavior will link the midbrain pathway to specific visual functions. Thus, the results obtained will broaden our understanding of \"divisions of labor\" in the brain.  Division of labor is likely to be a general principal of brain function because many sensory systems are comprised of\r\nmultiple parallel pathways just like those comprising the visual system. Each of the pathways is likely to be highly specialized for particular functions, rather than omponents in multiple redundant pathways. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
