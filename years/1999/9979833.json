The project involves a consortium of five colleges, the several units of the University of Massachusetts, and utilizes the experiences in distance education, industrial relations, and technology transfer of the department.  The project addresses four areas: curriculum development; educational technology; new pedagogy; and leveraging partnerships.  The project seeks to achieve three goals: to maintain the curriculum at the cutting edge of telecommunications and computing; to accommodate students with varied backgrounds, motivations and educational goals; and to motivate faculty to evolve and adopt new educational pedagogy.  Assessment and evaluation are incorporated in the project from the beginning and it is expected that the project will have a significant impact in undergraduate education. \r\n\r\n",
