 "awd_abstract_narration": "Voltage stability assessment and enhancement in power systems will depend, to a large extent, on successfully addressing a number of fundamental issues.  These are the use of long-term dynamic simulations to ensure proper margins, the existence of reliable models, and the formulation of intelligent reactive power management and control strategies that are robust, accurate, and fast.  Just providing the operator with information on the security margins is not always adequate.  This information has to be provided well in advance of impending voltage insecurity, such that appropriate preventive control actions can be taken.  Many experts fear that reactive power management will become a crucial reliability issue in the present deregulated environment - a scenario stemming from the unbundling of services. With many system operators opting against maintaining acceptable voltage profiles in the face of competition, systems are now facing renewed threats of voltage collapse.  There have been several reports of widespread cascading outages due to inadequate reactive reserves.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is aimed at accomplishing three tasks, those of (i) developing accurate models for mid-term voltage stability assessment; (ii) developing a new aggregation method for dynamic simulations based on the estimated interpolation errors of static states, and (iii) introducing fast and effective remedial measures for mitigating mid-term voltage instability in power grids.  Stability enhancement measures will entail a number of automatic schemes encompassing over-excitation limiters, generator automatic voltage regulators (AVRs), shunt capacitor banks, area reactive power coordination, under-voltage load shedding, etc.  The use of fuzzy sets and/or neuro-fuzzy control algorithms will be investigated for tighter control.  The project will be led by investigators with a combined thirty years of experience in power systems modeling, simulations, and in intelligent control algorithms.  Interactions with industry experts will provide guidance in developing practical designs.  New course modules in power system stability and in intelligent controls will be put in place in order to fulfill the educational objectives of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
