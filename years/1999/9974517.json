 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal #9974517\r\nLisa Elferink\r\n\r\nSynaptic transmission is the primary form of communication between neurons.  It is a highly regulated process that underlies virtually all neuronalpathways, from simple reflexes to higher order brain function such as learning and memory.  Synaptic transmission involves the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic and secretory vesicles by exocytosis followed by the retrieval of vesicle membranes by endocytosis.  Therefore endocytosis is essential for the continued secretory function of neural cells.  Impairment of this process is likely to result in paralysis or mental disorders.  The long term goal of this proposal is to examine the molecular mechanism mediating secretory vesicle recycling and its role in synaptic transmission.  Rab GTPases are a family of monomeric proteins involved in membrane transport.  Rab15 will form a focal point for these studies since its expression is enriched over other endosomal rabs in cells with high levels of secretion such as neurons and neuroendocrine cells.  Moreover, rab15 localizes to early endosomes in non-neuronal cells, consistent with its proposed role in endocytosis.  This proposal describes experiments that examine the role of rab15 in secretory vesicle recycling.  First we will identify the endocytic transport step regulated by rab15 in non-neuronal cells - key findings will be applied to neuroendocrine cells.\r\nSecond, we will determine rab15's subcellular localization in neuroendocrine cells.  Finally, we will examine the role of rab15 in secretory vesicle recycling.  Together, these studies will shed new light\r\non the role of rab15 in regulating the recycling of secretory vesicles during synaptic transmission and more generally, on the molecular mechanisms determining the specificity of endocytosis in all cell types.\r\n\r\n",
