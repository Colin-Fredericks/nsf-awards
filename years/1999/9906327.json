 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze the origins and development of informal dispute resolution and its relationship to the introduction and application of formal and statutory modes of arbitration. Both the law and public policy during the nineteenth century in England placed an increasing emphasis on the elaboration and implementation of arbitration as a means to resolve disputes, especially in the field of industrial relations. Based upon extensive research into local newspaper collections, trade union and employers' organizations archival material, parliamentary papers, and the private papers of local attorneys and barristers, this project seeks to reveal the wide variety of forms of arbitration during this period. Moreover, its analytical perspective will be derived from an interdisciplinary approach that merges legal history and theory with industrial relations theory. Consequently, emphasis will be placed upon the distinction between private and statutory legal system as well as the importance of rule-making and job regulation. Currently, in the wake of the burgeoning litigation crisis, there is a movement among attorneys and judges to employ alternative means of dispute resolution, particularly arbitration, and thereby alleviate the current congestion in the courts will be alleviated. By studying the history of arbitration, not only will earlier practices and precedents be uncovered but individual case studies will help to identify both the sources of arbitration's success and the causes of its failures.\r\n\r\n",
