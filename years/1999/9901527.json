 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two communities coexist in the parallel compilation field:\r\ninstruction-level parallelism (targeted at multiple functional units within\r\na CPU), and parallelization of sequential loops (usually targeted at\r\nmultiple processors).  The goals and techniques used in these\r\nsubdisciplines are strongly related, yet different, and there is\r\nsurprisingly little interaction between them.  During the week of April\r\n19-23, 1999 a workshop on instruction-level parallelism and loop\r\nparallelization will be held at the International conference and Research\r\nCenter for Computer Science (IBFI) at Dagstuhl Castle in Wadern, Germany.\r\nThe workshop will bring together about forty active researchers from the\r\ntwo camps.  The intention of the workshop is to stimulate intellectual\r\nferment by presentation of new results and comparison of these two\r\napproaches to parallelism.  The workshop's format will make it possible for\r\nparticipants to give more in-depth presentations than is customary at\r\nconferences.  Presentations may include demonstrations of working systems\r\nor prototypes.  Attendees will include researchers from the United States\r\nand Europe, comprising many well-known names in the parallelization\r\ncommunity. This proposal requests funds to cover the transatlantic airfare\r\nand registration for participants from the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
