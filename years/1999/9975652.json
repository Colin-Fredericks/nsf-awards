The instrument will be used to obtain accurate and reproducible intensities, high resolution, high signal to noise, and peak shapes that can be analytically modeled by chemists, material scientists and chemical engineers.  Examples of projects that will use the facility include examining how changes in crystal structure and composition influence the electronic structure of solid state inorganic materials, primarily complex oxide, nitride and sulfide materials.  Determination of structures of microporous materials synthesized by novel routes as well as size distributions of nanocrystalline zeolites will be carried out.  Quantitative analysis of phases present in ceramics used for high temperature sensors will provide important information on the sensing mechanisms.  Structures of novel inorganic complexes composed of lathanide and transition metals with a variety of ligands, including boranes will be determined. Heterogeneous catalysts including metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, supported metals and heteropoly compounds undergo important phase transformations relevant to their catalytic properties and will be studied.  In addition, analysis of stresses in alloys and how nanocrystalline materials influence polymer properties will be examined.\r\n\r\nThe instrument will be housed in the Analytical Chemistry facility of the Chemistry Department.  It will be used to provide comprehensive training in powder diffraction methods and for research projects.\r\n%%%\r\nThis equipment will significantly enhance the research and educational capabilities of this institution.\r\n***\r\n",
