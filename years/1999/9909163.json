 "awd_abstract_narration": "On December 8, 1999, the electrical power system of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) failed in the San Francisco Bay Area, leaving more than 456,000 customers without power in San Francisco and San Mateo counties.  The power outage affected businesses, government agencies, transportation, hospitals and individuals, potentially compromising the economy and welfare of the community for a number of hours.  The company announced that it would take full responsibility for the event and solicited damage claims from affected parties.  As of early April, 1999, 4,895 claims had been received.  A special claims management unit was established at PG&E and a claims data base has been assembled to include all information pertinent to the processing of damage claims.  This represents the most complete database available, which traces the economic and social consequences of a specific electric power infrastructure failure.  PG&E has agreed to provide access to the claims database for this study of the indirect cost implications of the power outage for natural disaster situations.  The database will be used to compare empirical data on indirect loss with the range of models, which have been proposed by experts.  This project should help advance the art of estimating indirect disaster losses and the basis for sound mitigation policy in the U.S.",
