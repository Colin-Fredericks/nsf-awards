 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875838\r\nvan der Meulen\r\nThis Career Development proposal develops an integrated four-year plan for Orthopaedic Biomechanics at Cornell University. The proposal develops three specific objectives: (1) to understand the relationship between in vivo mechanical loading and skeletal functional adaptation from analytical models of trabecular bone adaptation experiments; (2) to integrate biomechanical engineering into the mechanical engineering curriculum; and, (3) to introduce mechanical and biomechanical engineering to precollege students, particularly women.\r\n\r\nThe relationship between skeletal loading and bone functional adaptation will be examined in analytical models of trabecular bone adaptation experiments being performed at the Hospital for Special Surgery. A device has been designed to apply a known compressive force to the trabecular bone of the rabbit distal femur. Three-dimensional micro-computed tomography scans of the loaded region will be converted into large-scale finite element models. These models of trabecular morphology will be used to understand the interaction between applied loading and trabecular bone adaptation. This proposal will: (1) develop three-dimensional simulations of experimental adaptation which will relate experiments and analyses at the microstructural level; (2) determine in vivo loading for the experiments; (3) measure and incorporate experimental parameters; and, (4) develop next generation material models which are more precise than the current uniform, isotropic approach. The goal of this work is to improve the ability to model and interpret in vivo adaptation experiments, leading ultimately to the ability to simulate and predict future experiments. The outcome will have implications for the understanding of skeletal pathologies such as osteoporosis. \r\n\r\nAs part of the education plan, biomechanical engineering case studies and projects will be integrated into the undergraduate design curriculum. The foundation of these projects will be similar to the proposed research: integration of experimental and analytical methodology. The addition of interesting, realistic interdisciplinary projects will provide students experience with problem-based and cooperative learning and will help develop engineering skills to ensure future success. Bone functional adaptation will also be incorporated into the curriculum. In addition, an integrated case-based graduate curriculum is being implemented for first year biomechanics students.\r\n\r\nFinally, workshops and outreach programs will introduce precollege students to mechanical and biomechanical engineering. Hands-on biomechanics and mechanical dissection workshops will introduce precollege students to mechanics fundamentals. The focus will be on developing pipeline programs to present engineering to girls. \r\n\r\n",
