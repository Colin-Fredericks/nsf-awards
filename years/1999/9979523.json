 "awd_abstract_narration": "SMET graduate students at West Virginia University are providing content and instructional support to middle school teachers through a project involving West Virginia University Colleges of Arts & Sciences, Engineering & Mineral Resources, and Human Resources & Education.  As a part of TIGERS (Teams of Interdisciplinary Graduate- Fellows Engaged to Reinvigorate Students about SMET), three teams of four graduate students are formed around interdisciplinary themes that are a part of normal instruction in middle school science under Project CATS (Coordinated and Thematic Science). TIGERS fellows and 12 middle school teachers work together during the summer to pool their strengths of content and pedagogy in organizing thematic mathematics and science instruction to be implemented in the fall. TIGERS fellows share the insights gained from their research, while teachers share an appreciation for the middle school learner and school context. During the academic year, the teams of TIGER fellows visit the participating schools, facilitating science and mathematics instruction through hands-on learning experiences, long-term investigations, and field experiences. Upon completion of their experience, TIGERS fellows have an enhanced capacity to integrate their content experience with pedagogy as they become the professoriate and professionals of tomorrow.",
