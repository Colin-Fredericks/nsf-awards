 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on storage management systems that support multiple media types (video, audio, animations, graphics, images). The framework conceptualizes a multimedia presentation as a collection of objects with arbitrary temporal constraints. The participant objects and their constraints can be defined statically (prior to the display of the presentation) or dynamically (during the display). The main goal of this research is to exploit these temporal constraints to significantly improve the performance of the storage system. This project devises techniques to: (1) place data on disks, (2) store redundant information for fault tolerance, and (3) schedule the retrieval of data from disks to display statically and dynamically defined presentations during normal operation and during disk failures. On the educational front, the objective of this project is to: (1) enhance the information systems curriculum to incorporate evolving multimedia technology; (2) promote collaboration between researchers and practitioners in the field; (3) reach students constrained by time, location, and/or physical disability; and (4) mentor women pursuing careers in computer science and engineering. An undergraduate course on Multimedia Systems and a graduate course on Multimedia Database Management Systems are being developed. Also, establishment of industrial connections and research seminars are being planned. This research has the potential to significantly improve the design of multimedia storage systems supporting applications such as: computer animation, virtual reality, video games, digital video editing, and authoring tools for education.",
