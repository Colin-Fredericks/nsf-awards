The most important sense by which human beings experience their universe is vision.  Most of the human brain is dedicated to processing the many facets of visual sensation derived from the complex apparatus of the eyes.  The response of the eyes to the visual world, as measured by a number of eye tracking methods, has proven to be immensely valuable as a behavioral window onto human brain function.  Mapping the neuronal networks that coordinate the eyes with the visual experience processed by the brain and perceived by the mind can now be achieved with fMRI at high spatial and temporal resolution.  The complete interpretation of these data requires that eye position be measured simultaneously with the mapping by fMRI.  This seemingly simple task poses several severe challenges of mutual-incompatibilities with existing equipment.  This project has defined these challenges and will approach solutions.  Thus the project supported by this award will construct a robust investigational fMRI-compatible eye tracking system that can be used routinely by investigators funded to study human cognition using fMRI and eye movement.\r\n",
