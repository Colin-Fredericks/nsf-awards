 "awd_abstract_narration": "S. S. Antman will treat a variety of dynamical and  steady-state\r\nnonlinear problems for rods, shells, and three-dimensional solid bodies.\r\nThe bodies are composed of nonlinearly elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, \r\nviscoplastic, or magnetoelastic materials.  In each case, properly invariant, \r\ngeometrically exact theories encompassing general nonlinear constititutive \r\nequations are to be used.  The goals of these studies are to discover new \r\nnonlinear effects, determine thresholds in constititutive equations separating \r\nqualitatively different responses, determine general classes of constitutive \r\nequations that are both physically and mathematically natural,  examine \r\nimportant kinds of instabilities, contribute to the theory of shocks and dissipative \r\nmechanisms in solids, and develop new methods of nonlinear analysis and of \r\neffective computationfor problems of solid mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe award will support mathematical research on the mechanics of solids, \r\nsuch as metals, plastics, etc.  Qualitative phenomena such as the buckling \r\nof columns and shells, the propagation of waves in rods, and the formation of \r\nshocks that could lead to fracture will be studied for wide classes of mathematical \r\nmodels. This work is interdisciplinary, combining modern techniques\r\nfrom engineering mechanics, physics, and mathematics.  One important feature\r\nof the modern mathematical techniques employed, which is not widely known \r\noutside of mathematical circles, is that the analytical methods used can handle whole \r\nclasses of physical problems for different kinds of materials in different kinds of \r\nshapes subject subject to different kinds of loadings, all at the same time.\r\nIn this sense, the approach is the antithesis of computational methods,\r\nwhich can handle only one specific problem at a time. Part of the outcome of this \r\nwork will be the development of effective numerical methods for this rich class \r\nof problems, and some of the results will be illustrated numerically.\r\n",
