 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GK-12 program enhances K-12 science and mathematics education by creating dynamic learning environments partnering Rutgers graduate and advanced undergraduate students in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology (SMET) with teachers, administrators, and students in three New Jersey school districts.  Each year, ten graduate and ten advanced undergraduate students in SMET (referred to as \"fellows\") serve as resources for middle school and junior high school teachers in science and mathematics instruction.  Ten teams of fellows form partnerships with two or three teachers in a participating middle school and collaborate during the year to develop curriculum-based SMET activities in areas targeted by the schools.  Teachers and fellows begin their partnerships each year in a Summer Institute which includes sessions on curriculum, pedagogy, and advances in SMET fields.  Teams of fellows and teachers begin the process of developing new curriculum-based science activities during the Summer Institute, and continue to work together in the schools for ten hours each week.  Fellows devote an additional five hours to preparation and regular meetings and seminars. This project benefits several constituencies.  While working in schools, fellows improve their teaching skills as they communicate and convey the spirit and substance of science and scientific research.  The science and mathematics background of middle school/junior high school teachers are strengthened and enhanced through their participation in these professional collaborations.  K-12 students experience the excitement and relevance of science, mathematics and technology education.  School districts, their administrators and educators, benefit from their sustained partnership with the University, its faculty and students.",
