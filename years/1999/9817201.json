 "awd_abstract_narration": "P.I.: COLE, Gregory\r\n   Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are a specialized class of protein that are crucial to the development of the nervous system.  HSPGs are proposed to regulate processes as diverse as neural cell differentiation, cell adhesion and axon outgrowth.  Recent studies from Dr. Cole's laboratory have shown that the adhesion of neural cells to each other, that is mediated by the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM, is modulated by HSPG.  Biochemical and molecular studies of this HSPG have resulted in the demonstration that agrin is a HSPG that binds to NCAM.  Agrin is an extracellular matrix protein identified and named based on its involvement in the aggregation of acetylcholine receptors during formation of the connections between motor nerves and skeletal muscle (neuromuscular junction).  Emerging evidence indicates that agrin's function is not limited to its role in acetylcholine receptor aggregation, as the majority of agrin expression occurs in developing central nervous system, kidney and lung.   In support of this postulate, disruption of the agrin gene in mice is lethal prior to birth, suggesting that a crucial function of agrin is related to embryonic development, and not solely receptor aggregation of developing neuromuscular junctions.   Agrin's expression in the brain and spinal cord is of particular interest, as it is primarily associated with developing nerve pathways. The studies outlined in this proposal are aimed at understanding how agrin functions in brain development by interacting with specific extracellular matrix molecules in the nervous system.  The studies described herein will examine both heparan sulfate-dependent and -independent interactions between agrin and the extracellular matrix. \r\nThese studies will also examine how agrin may be a important modulator of extracellular matrix formation in developing embryos, and how agrin may regulate the formation of nerve tracts in the developing nervous system.  \r\n",
