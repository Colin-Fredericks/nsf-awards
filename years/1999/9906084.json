The two scientists plan to investigate quasi-periodic oscillations, chaos and the control of chaos in certain physical systems.  The two scientists' groups have independently developed new ideas on these topics that provide the basis for the proposed research.  The research project concerns a theoretical, numerical and experimental study of parametric convective instability in traditional and magnetic fluids.  Attention will be focused on the case of a fluid layer simultaneously forced by periodic variations in body forces and in temperature gradient.  Investigations will be made of the quasi-periodic behavior, and a stability analysis of the basic state of the system will also be carried out.   The results will be compared with experimental work.\r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow collaboration between two qualified scientists who have done independent research.  The work is to be divided between the two sides based on the special skills and the available resources.  Dr. Belhaq has spent the summer of 1997, under a Fulbright grant, working with Dr. Rand at Cornell University, so it is expected that the two will collaborate with each other successfully.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit. \r\n",
