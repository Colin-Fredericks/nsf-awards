 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation's Innovation and Organizational Change Program and GOALI, this project tests competing political economy models of the changes required to develop and maintain the cooperation with suppliers and customers necessary for successful life cycle oriented environmental management (LCOEM). Firms are under increasing pressure from market and legal forces to change their approach to environmental management a more innovative one where they reduce pollution inside the firm and beyond their own boundaries.  Firms do so by managing the entire physical system life cycle of their products or services from the creation of inputs to the final disposal of outputs.  LCOEM requires that for a firm to improve its overall environmental performance, it must consider the effects both up and downstream from its own efforts. \r\n\r\nTo address these life-cycle effects, the environmental activities of suppliers and the environmental needs of customers must become part of the focal firm's environmental management efforts. Data from a multi- informant, mailed survey will be used to test the competing theoretical models of inter firm cooperation against each other, as well as provide data for the benchmarking study. \r\n\r\nWith the results of this study, firms will be able to better develop and maintain the inter firm relationships necessary for LCOEM by overcoming the barriers to change that such cooperation requires.  As firms improve their inter firm environmental cooperation, society benefits from the improved environmental performance.\r\n",
