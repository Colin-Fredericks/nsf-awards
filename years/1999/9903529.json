 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis project involves the use of numerical models to address key issues in tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry.  In terms of tropospheric chemistry, the focus is on understanding the factors controlling the global atmospheric methane burden.  During the past 250 years, there has been a major increase in the atmospheric concentration of methane.  Over the past two decades, the growth rate has slowed and it has been suggested that methane is approaching steady state in the atmosphere.  A three-dimensional chemical transport model driven by assimilated meteorological observations will be used to investigate the budgets of methane and the related species carbon monoxide and hydrogen.  The chemical transport model will be used in conjunction with a 4-box model to derive a history of methane emissions over longer time scales.   In terms of stratospheric chemistry, the focus of this project is on understanding the role of horizontal and vertical mixing in determining the distribution of stratospheric ozone.  Specifically, measurements will be compared with results of a two dimensional model with high vertical resolution to examine the effect of various assumptions about mixing and gravity wave induced drag.  A second goal is to study the effect of planetary waves emanating from the troposphere on the distribution of stratospheric ozone.  This effort involves the use of model simulations to infer the magnitude of changes in circulation required to reproduce observed change in total ozone and temperature at midlatitudes.  These results will be compared with the changes diagnosed from the NCAR/NCEP analysis of planetary wave forcing.",
