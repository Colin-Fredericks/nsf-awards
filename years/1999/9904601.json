 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on the developmental biology of animals has provided a rich data\r\nbase focused principally on how the interactions among the genes of an\r\nindividual orchestrate a program that  results in the ultimate form and\r\nfunction characteristic of particular species.  In contrast, despite the\r\nfact that all animals have, and perhaps require, the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of stable associations with bacteria, an understanding of how\r\nthese relationships integrate into the developmental programs of the host\r\nanimals remains rudimentary .  Broad questions include:  how does the\r\nembryonic period prepare the tissues destined to interact with\r\nenvironmental bacteria so that they successfully establish a relationship\r\nwith only the specific subset of bacteria that associate with a given\r\nanimal species?   What processes characterize the progression of the\r\ninteraction from the initiation phase to the mature, stable association?\r\nAnd, what genes are co-opted from other developmental processes to mediate\r\nthese interactions, and what genes are unique?\r\n\r\nThe cooperative association between the sepiolid squid Euprymna scolopes\r\nand its luminous bacterial partner Vibrio fischeri has proven to be an\r\neffective model system with which to examine the 'dialogue' between the two\r\ndisparate genomes.  As with most animal species, there is no direct\r\ninterplay between the host squid and bacteria during embryogenesis.\r\nNonetheless, during this period a complex set of tissues arises in the\r\ndeveloping squid that readies the animal, upon hatching, to interact with\r\nenvironmental V. fischeri cells.  Within minutes to hours following\r\nhatching, the juvenile host is colonized, and this benign infection\r\ntriggers a dramatic morphogenesis of the host light organ.  Most notably,\r\nan extensive, bacteria-induced program of cell death ensues that targets\r\nspecific host epithelial cells.  Most notably, bacteria-induced cell death\r\nresults in the loss of superficial epithelial structures that appear to\r\nensure a rapid, successful colonization of the nascent light organ.\r\nSubsequently, the bacterial light organ forms those tissues essential for\r\nthe mature, functional symbiosis; i.e., tissues that will function to\r\nmodify the bacteria-produced light are elaborated that allow the host to\r\nuse the luminescence in its behavior.  These three morphological stages in\r\nhost organ development, i.e., embryogenesis, infection and maturation, are\r\ncoordinated with changes in gene expression of the bacterial symbiont.\r\nDuring the infection, the host light organ environment induces the bacteria\r\nto luminesce, lose their flagella, and decrease in size.\r\n\r\nTaken together these complex developmental changes in both host and\r\nsymbiont suggest the presence of a coordinated, reciprocal interaction\r\nsimilar to that described for the development of the leguminous plant\r\nsymbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria.  The work proposed herein will be\r\namong the first studies that will examine the signals underlying such\r\nreciprocal interactions in an animal-bacterial association.  The specific\r\nobjectives of the current project are to :  1) determine the identities of\r\nthe bacterial signals that induce cell death and inhibit further cell\r\nproliferation of the host's superficial epithelium; 2) define the factors\r\nthat mediate bacterial attachment to crypt cells that are responsible for\r\ncrypt cell development; and, 3) identify the bacteria-induced host genes\r\nthat are differentially expressed during the early developmental stages of\r\nthe symbiosis.",
