Orthopaedics Division, Memphis, TN), which aims to improve fundamental understanding of the process bio-integration of coated orthopaedic devices, such as hip and knee replacement prostheses which are implanted into some 250,000 patients yearly in the U.S. alone, and the adherence of coatings to the underlying metal alloy of the prosthesis.  Coatings such as the calcium phosphate compound hydroxyapatite encourage the bonding of bone to such osteo-implants, while deliberately grown oxidation scales such as zirconium oxide provide superior wear properties in joint locations.  Mechanical failure of such coatings can occur at the coating/bone interface or at the coating/alloy interface (or nearby within the coating itself), either loosening the implant or contributing irritating wear particles.  \r\n\r\nThe program comprises an investigation of the integrity of both interfaces, in the first case focusing on bone-bonding to bioactive hydroxyapatite coatings deposited by both plasma spraying and ion-beam assisted deposition methods, with primary application to cementless hip-replacement prostheses, and in the second on the adhesion of hard-wearing zirconia oxidation scales to Zr-Nb alloy components, of primary interest in total knee replacements.  Both in vivo  (live) implantations into dog femurs and tibiae for times between 3 hours to 10 days and in vitro  (test tube) experiments in appropriate simulated culture fluid are being pursued.\r\n\r\nThe primary investigative tool is high-resolution electron microscopy, providing high-resolution structural and chemical information about the coatings and interfaces and the progress of bone mineralization at coating surfaces.  Labeling techniques are being employed on the same specimens to identify various proteins which serve as precursors to bone formation  These techniques are being supplemented by X-ray determinations of coating stress states and measurement of coating surface roughnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
