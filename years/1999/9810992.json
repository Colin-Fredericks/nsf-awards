The two plan to develop predictive maintenance management software to aid industries in Egypt and in the United States in implementing superior condition-based maintenance strategies.  In addition to the software, they will investigate communication channels and data base structures for condition monitoring and maintenance management software, and will also investigate the decision support mechanisms to provide work order initiation based on machinery condition.\r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow collaboration between Egyptian and US scientists who have significant complementary technical background and expertise to carry out the proposed project.  The Vibration Institute is a main source of information on available technologies for vibration analyses and its staff has extensive experience in machinery analysis and condition monitoring.  The Egyptian scientist leads a strong team in vibration analyses and software development.  This project will provide a new advanced tool to manufacturers and machinery maintenance organizations to efficiently schedule maintenance and reduce costs for services and for replacements of expensive machinery.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas that benefit both sides.   This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. \r\n\r\n",
