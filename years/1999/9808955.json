That is, the basic building blocks are considered\r\nup to ambient isotopy (not homotopy or homology).  For example, one\r\nstarts from knots in 3-manifolds, surfaces in 4-manifolds, etc.  This\r\nis a far-reaching program.  Until now, one has been limited to 3-manifolds,\r\nwith only a glance towards 4-manifolds.  The principal objects of the\r\ntheory are skein modules.  One of the simplest skein modules is a\r\nquantization of the first homology group of a manifold.  In general,\r\nskein modules of 3-manifolds are quotients of free modules over ambient\r\nisotopy classes of links by properly chosen local (skein) relations.\r\nThe situation is somewhat reminiscent of that of ``classical'' algebraic\r\ntopology 100 years ago (before Poincare's fundamental paper ``Analysis\r\nSitus,'' in 1895.  Even three years ago one was able to compute only a\r\nfew isolated examples, with the hope that the theory would rise in the\r\nfuture to a beautiful and powerful theory (the only exception was the\r\nTuraev-Przytycki construction of the Hopf algebra on the third skein\r\nmodule of the product of a surface and the interval).  The situation\r\nhas started to change in the last three years, and most of the progress\r\nconcerns the Kauffman bracket skein module and its relation to character\r\nvarieties of the fundamental group of a 3-manifold and the hyperbolic\r\nstructure on a manifold.\r\n     Topology, as foreseen by Leibniz in 1679, is the art of analyzing\r\ngeometrical figures taking into account their position only; it does not\r\ntake magnitudes into consideration (Leibniz called this art ``geometry\r\nsitus'').  In more modern language, topology describes spaces up to\r\nstretching and bending (but cutting and pasting is not allowed).  Because\r\nof their flexibility, topological spaces are hard to analyze.  In his\r\nfundamental paper of 1895, Analysis Situs, Henri Poincare associated\r\ntopological spaces with algebraic objects that are invariant under space\r\ndeformation (he called his objects homology and homotopy groups).  The\r\nfield of algebraic topology arose from the work of Poincare.  Knot theory\r\nis the oldest branch of topology, first considered by A. Vandermonde in\r\n1771.  It studies the position of a circle (say a piece of rope with ends\r\nglued together) in space.  Knot theory also has its roots in physics.\r\nW. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) proposed, in 1867, a theory of vortex atoms:\r\nthat atoms were knotted tubes of ether.  It was an aim of his friend P.G.\r\nTait to describe the physical and chemical properties of particles in\r\nterms of the properties of related knots.  Although the vortex theory\r\nwas soon rejected, knot theory quickly developed to become an independent\r\nbranch of topology.  By the 1970's, some thought knot theory was out ot\r\nsteam.  Thus it came as a surprise when in 1984 Vaughan Jones discovered\r\nnew algebraic invariants of knots (i.e., Jones polynomials).  Jones'\r\nwork was a breakthrough, providing solutions to old conjectures.  In the\r\nsame spirit as Leibniz, one would call the branch of mathematics that has\r\nits roots in Jones' construction, and Drinfeld's work on quantum groups,\r\n``algebra situs.''  It encompasses the theory of quantum invariants of\r\nknots and 3-manifolds, algebraic topology based on knots, q-deformations,\r\nquantum groups, and overlaps with algebraic geometry, non-commutative\r\ngeometry, and statistical mechanics.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
