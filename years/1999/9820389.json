 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each summer, 10 undergraduates will be selected from a pool of 600-700 applicants to spend three weeks learning basic molecular biology techniques in an intensive laboratory course. Following the course, each student will spend seven weeks completing an independent research project, which involves the application of many of the techniques, learned in the course. The research project is conducted under the direction of one of the more than 80 faculty members affiliated with the program. The mentors are basic scientists who have a common interest in research, which involves the use of recombinant DNA technology. During the ten-week period, students also will participate in interactive seminars which focus on responsible conduct of research and ethical issues in the rapidly changing research environment.  Supplemental activities include weekly student seminars and evening workshops designed to strengthen future applications for postgraduate studies.  All students will attend a campus-wide research conference at the end of the program where they will present the results of their research project through a scientific poster and/or a scientific paper. At least one-half of the participants will be from underrepresented groups women, students of color, and students with disabilities and will be from institutions other than the University of Minnesota.",
