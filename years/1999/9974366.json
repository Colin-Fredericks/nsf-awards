 "awd_abstract_narration": "9974366\r\nComposto\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will focus on the dynamics of phase separating thin film blends.  These studies aim to develop a comprehensive understanding of thin film kinetics by measuring the wetting layer growth at both the air / polymer and polymer / substrate interfaces, phase morphology immediately beneath the wetting layer, domain coarsening, surface roughness, and the roughness between the wet and non-wet phases.  To probe underlying principles, dynamics will be studied as a function of materials parameters including molecular weight and composition, process dependent variables including film thickness and temperature, and substrate surface energy.  To test for universal behavior, a range of model blend systems will be investigated including blends with a lower critical solution temperature and an upper critical solution temperature, in addition to copolymer blends.  To directly test the interplay between phase separation and wetting, AFM will be used to directly image the near-surface morphology after selective etching of the wetting phase.  Wetting layer growth will be followed using low-energy, forward recoil spectrometry, LE-FRES, and neutron reflectivity.  Furthermore, LE-FRES will be developed for the analysis of laterally non-uniform samples.  To quantify lateral phase composition and possibly the interfacial width at curved interfaces, analytical TEM will be developed in-house and near edge x-ray adsorption fine structure spectroscopy will be performed in collaboration with NIST.  In addition to homogeneous substrates, studies will aim to control lateral profiling studies, wetting properties will be measured using a contact angle goniometer and AFM.  An important component of the proposed research is to extend fundamental studies on model systems to advanced materials involving ionomer adhesion promoters and patterned dielectric materials.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research on polymer films and coatings will provide fundamental scientific understanding that could impact advanced technological applications in the health (e.g. contact lenses, membranes) and microelectronics (e.g. dielectrics and resists) fields.  Undergraduates (4/year) will continue to participate in the research program, along with public high-school teachers during the summer.\r\n",
