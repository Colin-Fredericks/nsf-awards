Tenses, like pronouns, must be linked to suitable antecedents-time intervals, for tenses-that are salient in the context. With the advent of compositional theories of dynamic context change (Groenendijk & Stokhof 1990, Kamp & Reyle 1993, Chierchia 1995, van Eijck & Kamp 1997, etc), the theory of temporal anaphora in English has reached an impressive level of explicitness and generality. These results are rapidly being generalized to tensed languages of less familiar types by recent developments in dynamic CrossLinguistic Semantics (developed by the PI)-a universal type-driven system for translation into dynamic update logic. The problem is that the theory that is emerging is unduly centered on tense. It therefore fails to extend to languages like Eskimo, which are tenseless but still convey temporal information as briefly and precisely as English. Even for tensed languages, undue theoretical bias in the direction of tense is liable to impede further progress on temporal anaphora because it may obscure or distort significant parallels with non-temporal domains.\r\nThis three-year project is designed to generalize the current theory so that the temporal facts of tensed languages (like English) and tenseless languages (like Eskimo) are correctly predicted by a universal set of compositional principles applied to independently motivated syntactic structures. Towards this goal, the research plan includes a detailed empirical investigation of temporal anaphora in Eskimo, a typologically unusual language whose temporal interpretation has never been studied. This fieldwork is to be carried out by the PI, who has already done the requisite syntactic research (in a prior NSF funded project) and has extensive fieldwork experience. To avoid undue Eskimo-centering, the PI will also investigate, with the help of native speaker GAs, the temporal facts of three other unfamiliar languages-including Chinese, which likewise has been reported as tenseless. Finally, an obviously relevant phenomenon is presupposition. Recently there has been a flood of new advances, including much work that is still unpublished. A one-week course on this topic to be taught at Rutgers in the first year of the project by a leading authority, Hans Kamp (Stuttgart University), is therefore also an integral part of the research plan.\r\nThe theoretical issues to be investigated in this project range from natural language metaphysics (e.g., the conception of time that underlies the use of temporal expressions) through all the details of compositional semantic interpretation. The results of this project should therefore be of interest to researchers in a correspondingly wide range of fields-not only formal semantics, but also computational linguistics, formal syntax and philosophy of language and mind.\r\n",
