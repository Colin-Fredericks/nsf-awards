 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent genetic research on chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) of the Tai forest, Ivory Coast reveals that half of the offspring in the study community were sired by males from another group.  This is remarkable because females are thought to Remain primarily within their own territory, and extra- group males are rarely seen to mate with these females.  These surprising results have challenged many of our prior expectations regarding chimpanzee reproductive success and suggest that females may have more influence on paternity than previously thought.  The proposed 24 month study of chimpanzees in the Tai forest will directly address the extent to which females 1) express mate preference for particular males, 2) influence the outcome of sexual interactions, and 3) demonstrate greater influence on the outcome of sexual interactions during the time when they are most likely to conceive.  By following females throughout the duration of their estrous cycles, this study will examine female reproductive behavior at various stages of estrous.  It will elucidate factors that most influence a female's ability to affect the outcome of a sexual interaction, in light of the inherent conflicts between male and female mating strategies.  Results from this study will contribute to our understanding of the genetic and behavioral reproductive patterns of chimpanzees in the wild, assist in elucidating the factors responsible for differential reproductive success in chimpanzees, and provide essential information for informed decision-making regarding the conservation and maintenance of the genetic diversity of this species.",
