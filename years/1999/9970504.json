 "awd_abstract_narration": "ULRICH,  9970504\r\n\r\nThe first part of the project aims at understanding blowup algebras of \r\nideals, which include Rees rings and associated graded rings. One of the \r\nmain objectives is to characterize the Cohen-Macaulayness of these \r\nalgebras in terms of reduction numbers. The principal investigator also \r\nintends to describe blowup algebras by means of the equations defining \r\nthem. This is closely related to determining the equations of the image of \r\na rational map between projective varieties. The second part of the \r\nproject concerns Rees algebras of modules and their applications. One of \r\nthe questions deals with the defining ideal as well as the \r\nCohen-Macaulayness and normality of varieties of commuting matrices. In \r\nessence, this is a problem about Rees algebras of certain modules of \r\nprojective dimension two. Another question concerns the Gauss image of \r\nprojective varieties and local analogues thereof. Phrased in terms of Rees \r\nalgebras of modules, the objective becomes to establish a lower bound for \r\nthe analytic spread of the module of differential forms. \r\n\r\nRees algebras of ideals are algebraic objects that describe the \r\nblowup of a variety along a subvariety. Although blowing up is a \r\nfundamental operation in the birational study of varieties, an explicit \r\nunderstanding of this process remains an open problem. The aim of the \r\nproject is a detailed investigation of the algebras that arise in this \r\ncontext. In addition, the wider class of Rees algebras of modules will be \r\nstudied, with a view towards various applications to algebraic and \r\ngeometric problems.\r\n",
