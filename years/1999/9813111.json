 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813111\r\n     The project will develop neutron computed tomography for use in various scientific and industrial applications.  The theoretical part will focus on developing improved image reconstruction algorithms that are best suited for reconstructions from neutronic projections.  The experimental part will consist of a series of tests using data obtained from Monte Carlo simulations as well as data from actual experimental measurements.  The project will address one of the most important and challenging problems in neutron tomography due to the multiple scattering of the neutron ray inside the object.  The neutron scattering can cause considerable image blurring.  To overcome this limitation, more recent approaches such as the slow-evolution-from-the-continuation-boundary method will be investigated and the performance of the newly developed methods will be compared with those obtained from the classical methods.  Other aspects of importance to image reconstruction from neutronic projections will be investigated.  These include the application of wavelets to edge detection and the development and implementation of parallel algorithms.\r\n     The significance of this research emanates from the growing need for nondestructive evaluation techniques with certain desirable properties.  Neutrons have attractive properties including strong attenuation by hydrogenous materials, high penetrability through metallic and highly dense materials, and inherent sensitivity to elemental and isotopic variations.\r\n",
