For example, increased rainfall and moisture along the California coast may influence plant survival and productivity directly, and influence animal species indirectly through the food chain. This research concerns the impact of El Ni=F1o on aggregative behavior of typically solitary animals. Increases in prey insect abundance during El Ni=F1o years have been demonstrated to result in higher density of spider populations, creating conditions favorable to aggregation and social behavior. The recent discovery of aggregations of the colonial web-building spider Metepeira spinipes on the Monterey peninsula in California, linked to the El Ni=F1o phenomenon, presents a unique research opportunity to understand the mechanism(s) responsible for group-living in spiders. The goal of the proposed research is the collection of pilot data on genetic structure of populations, to address hypotheses concerning group formation related to the El Ni=F1o cycle.  This will be accomplished with field studies, specimen collection, and the development of molecular techniques to analyze genetic similarity among colonies, and genetic relatedness among individuals within colonies. As social behavior is extremely rare in spiders, research on the few species that are \"an exception to the rule\" may yield valuable insights about the evolution of social behavior in=\r\nanimals.",
