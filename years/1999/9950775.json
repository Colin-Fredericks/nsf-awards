 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to create a power distribution systems curriculum through the adaptation of concepts and materials from several other institutions.  The power distribution systems curriculum is designed to educate students in the operation and planning of electric power distribution systems. The curriculum centers around a distribution automation and control equipment laboratory coupled with software programs to visualize collected data and to control the distribution system.\r\n\r\nThe proposed curriculum adapts and implements electric power distribution concepts that have been developed at other universities and further developed at Drexel University into an overall system approach. The curriculum centers on a laboratory that adapts software concepts, such as visualization, and experiments pertaining to capacitor placement and control, and implements improved hardware sensors and signal conditioning boards based on foreseen improvements to the distribution automation laboratory at National Taiwan University.  The designed curriculum has the following advantages by:\r\n1) introducing students to mathematical models for components with different system connections and grounding,\r\n2) approaching distribution networks from a system viewpoint where individual component models are applied to perform rigorous circuit analysis techniques,\r\n3) utilizing Hall Effect Devices for advanced monitoring of physical network conditions, and\r\n4) integrating signal conditioning boards for isolating varying phenomena - such as surges or spikes.\r\n",
