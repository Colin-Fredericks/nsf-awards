Each teacher will receive a minimum of 118 hours of instruction over the five years.  A facilitator-teacher in each school receives over 270 hours of inquiry-based science and methodology, technology, applications and leadership skills, in order to provide continuing school-site professional development.  The training is conducted by a consortium of New York City agencies, including NetTech, Lehman College, CCNY, and informal sites such as the Bronx Zoo.  Over 40 hours/year of training are in the use of NSF-supported materials (Insights and STC).  Up to 4 district staff members and the 27 facilitators will provide continued training, technical assistance, coordination, science kit distribution, and refurbishment.  In addition, parents at each school will be involved in science inquiry activities with the informal science partners.  A dedicated space in CES 4 houses the District Science Center where workshops and resources are located.  The project is an outgrowth of the district's involvement with the NYC and Bronx Urban Systemic Initiatives.\r\n\r\n",
