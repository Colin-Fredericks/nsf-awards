 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to adapt and implement techniques used in industry to a new senior level course and the senior design project laboratory, based upon remote data acquisition and control over the Internet.  The purpose of the project is to improve the laboratory experiences of senior computer science engineering students by implementing a suitable hardware/ software environment for multi-platform computer-based monitor and control of the environment to better prepare them for their professional work.  \r\n\r\nThe project incorporates the use of platform-independent languages such as Java to remotely control and monitor the environment from any computer connected to the Internet.   It uses the National Instrument's data acquisition software and hardware to provide a uniform representation of the physical environment across multiple computer platforms.  The project provides students with the novel opportunity to integrate their knowledge from different courses such as computer networks, microcomputers, signal processing and software languages into a real-life, hands-on experience to prepare them to be successful computer engineers.   \r\n\r\nThe institutional impact of this project is to greatly enhance the senior year educational experience of computer science engineering students.  An evaluation that includes a senior exit survey, feedback from an Industrial Advisory Council, and site visits from engineers from National Instruments is being conducted for the duration of the project.",
