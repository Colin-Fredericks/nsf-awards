Bucknell's initiative will focus on five primary areas of the curricula -- first-year engineering courses, the first discipline-specific courses, core engineering science courses, component analysis courses, and system design courses.\r\n\r\nThe project will involve a core of six faculty members from Bucknell's College of Engineering committed to developing and teaching courses designed around the principles central to this initiative.  Finally, Bucknell's faculty team will work actively to recruit 10 additional internal faculty and 30 faculty from other institutions to participate in two, one-week summer workshops during the third summer at Bucknell.  These workshops for the external teams will plant the seeds for systemic change at other institutions.  Each team will be assigned a Bucknell mentor/collaborator, and a team will collaborate regularly through video conferencing and email with that mentor and other Bucknell faculty during the academic year.\r\n",
