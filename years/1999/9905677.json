Such habitats are widespread on the planet.\r\nSulfonic acids are not only biosynthetic products of a variety of animals,\r\nplants and microbes, but are products of chemical commerce (for example,\r\nhousehold and industrial detergents, dyes, and soaps).  These compounds\r\nthus enter into both the carbon and sulfur biogeochemical cycles\r\non the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has recently been recognized that household and industrial detergents\r\nknown as sulfonic acids can be degraded, or cycled, by bacteria that\r\nthrive in habitats in which molecular oxygen is in limited supply.  This\r\nmetabolism of sulfonic acids results in release of sulfide, a chemical\r\nthat has the smell of \"rotten-egg\" and is, in addition, corrosive to metal\r\npipes, for example.  How these particular bacteria bring about this\r\nbiodegradation is the focus of this research project.  The results of the\r\nstudy may be of value in furthering our understanding of metal deterioration\r\nand how to minimize it, as well as to deepen our understanding of\r\nsulfonic acids' roles in contributing to the crucial cycling of carbon\r\nand sulfur compounds on the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
