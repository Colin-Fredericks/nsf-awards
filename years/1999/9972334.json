 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater has made considerable strides toward achieving the necessary infrastructure to provide instructional and research opportunities using modern biological methods and equipment.  Implementation of this project is completely restructuring and integrating our laboratory instruction in modern Physiology and Cell Biology.  We have assembled an integrated cross-disciplinary instructional team to address a specific set of goals designed to expand the depth of physiological principles our students encounter at all levels of their training.  The core of the project is the acquisition of six MacLab computer-based physiographs which modernized traditional experimental offerings in several courses.  The MacLab units also provide hardware to conduct new laboratory exercises in Introductory Cell Biology, Animal Physiology, Human Anatomy & Physiology, and Developmental Biology (for biology majors).  These exercises involve measurement of membrane potentials under a variety of physiological conditions, and the laboratory exercises build on one another to provide students with growth experiences.  The MacLab units are also utilized in basic physiological laboratory exercises in our introductory science courses (Biological Foundations, Science and Technology in Society; for non-science majors.)  These units include Macintosh computers, bridge amplifiers, intracellular probes, myographs, spirometers, electrical stimulators, blood pressure transducers, and other small transducers.  These units provide the ability to investigate most of the major areas of physiology:  cell biology, muscle, nervous, circulatory, cardiac, respiratory, and reproduction.  The PIs are active mentors of undergraduates and these units are used as a tool to strengthen involvement in undergraduate research.  Results of the assessment of implementation will be presented to appropriate professional meetings and distributed through regional and national organizations.  The current effort is an adaptation of and builds upon comparable activities that have been successfully implemented at Alverno College and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
