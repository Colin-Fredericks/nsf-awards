 "awd_abstract_narration": "Self-Explaining Learning Environments\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the centrality of explanation in science, one of the most compelling forms of learning environments revolves around explanation. Self-explaining learning environments could constitute a new frontier of educational software that combined two complementary explanation functionalities.  First, animated explanation generators could enable students to pose questions to objects and processes in 3D worlds, which in response would dynamically generate clear cinematic and narrative explanations of their own structure, function, and causality.  Second, explanation construction systems could pose problems to students about the phenomena they were actively investigating.  To solve the problems, students could employ a graphical explanation construction system to build explanation structures, which would then be semantically analyzed.  In these  mixed-initiative explanatory dialogues, students' misconceptions would be quickly identified and corrected, and gaps in reasoning would  be quickly filled.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research on self-explaining learning environments therefore has two major thrusts:\r\n \r\n1. Develop a full suite of self-explaining learning environment technologies.  To promote rich constructivist learning processes and outcomes, we will develop 3D animated explanation generation and explanation construction technologies for self-explaining learning environments.  To do so, we will build on the results of previous work on foundational intelligent multimedia technologies: 3D animation planners, multimedia explanation generators, discourse planning systems, intelligent constructivist learning environments, natural language generation systems, and intelligent virtual cinematography systems for 3D learning environments.  All design and implementation activities will be carried out in a 3D learning environment testbed for high school physics, PHYSVIZ, which is being developed in collaboration with a local science magnet school.\r\n \r\n2. Provide a comprehensive account of the cognitive processes and results of interacting with self-explaining learning environments by conducting extensive empirical studies.  Self-explaining learning environments serve as an ideal arena for studying constructivist learning.  To understand the cognitive mechanisms by which constructivist learning occurs, we will take multiple measures of both the process and the outcome of learning.  These studies will investigate the central issues in constructivist learning including the roles of multiple representations, guidance, visual realism, and multimodal coordination.  To assess conceptual change, special emphasis will be given to both near transfer and far transfer dependent measures.\r\n \r\nThe net result of this work will be two-fold: (1) a suite of intelligent, state-of-the-art learning environment technologies whose communication abilities and, hence, whose educational effectiveness, significantly surpass current-generation educational software, and (2) a comprehensive theory of explanation-based constructivist learning that furnishes a data-rich set of principles for guiding the design of future-generation learning environments.\r\n \r\n",
