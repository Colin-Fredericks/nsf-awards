Ion migration under electric fields will be used to inject charged additives in order to stabilize soils via cementation.  This project will demonstrate the potential use of ion migration to improve soil characteristics such as compressibility and shear strength.  Because the technique does not depend on pore fluid flow, it can be used effectively in soils with low hydraulic conductivity with little or no associated soil volume change.   \r\n\r\nIf proven out, this technique will permit in situ stabilization in a reasonable time period without causing large volume changes.  In this study, the grouting methodology will be applied to clay samples, and mechanical testing will be performed before and after grouting to assess the degree of mechanical property improvement.  The electrochemical properties of the soil will be evaluated and the impact of pore fluid chemistry and Ph on the rate of electroosmotic flow will be assessed.  This step is necessary in order to control electroosmotic flow during the electrochemical stabilization tests.  Batch tests will then be conducted without the application of electric fields in order to assess the effectiveness of additives on improving soil mechanical properties.  Finally, bench-scale tests will be conducted using electric fields to demonstrate the effectiveness of soil cementation by ion migration under electric fields. \r\n***",
