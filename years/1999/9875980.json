Infrared spectroscopy  will be used as the primary experimental tool. Instrumental innovations which the PI has recently implemented allow for a series of ambitious experiments which the technical limitations of standard infrared equipment had previously rendered impossible. Specific goals of the proposed research include:  i) a detailed survey of the phase diagrams of cuprate  high-Tc superconductors and of  two-dimensional (2D) organic compounds; ii) an investigation of possible fundamental differences between electron-doped and hole-doped cuprates;  iii) a survey of the interlayer electrodynamics in cuprates and organic compounds. Experimental work is closely linked to educational activities focused on the development of an undergraduate  program in Materials Physics at UCSD. \r\n%%%\r\nThis CAREER program combines research and educational activities in Materials Physics. The research component is focused on the systematic investigations of the exotic electronic  properties of several classes of intermetallic superconductors by means of infrared spectroscopy. A series of ambitious  experiments will help to resolve the key issues related to new physics of unconventional superconductivity. The educational part supports the development of a new undergraduate program aimed to  prepare students for a career  in industry. An analysis of the job market indicates that there is a demand for  graduates with specialization in Materials Physics and with  a solid science background.  The new program seeks to facilitate a tight  link between local industry and the educational process. \r\n ***                           \r\n\r\n\r\n",
