 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to advance econometric modeling in two directions. In the first direction, tools are developed that (a) significantly expand the universe of data sets that can be used for testing and estimation models of economic behavior and (b) drastically reduce the time and effort required to conduct formal statistical inference in newly formulated models. Tn. the second direction, econometric models are formulated that (a) impose assumptions that are closer to those of economic theory and (b) permit greater flexibility in those aspects of models to which economic theory does not speak, than is now the case.\r\n\r\nTwo aspects of the methods to be employed are common to these objectives. The first aspect is that inference in econometric models is Bayesian, conditioning on the data and maintaining consistency with the likelihood principle. The second aspect is that simulation methods are used to solve key technical problems that cannot be attacked analytically. In the first direction of advance, forward simulation from prior and data densities will be used to permit inference about models, parameters, and functions of interest conditional on selected features of the data. The ability to use selected features of the data enables expansion in the universe of data sets that can be used. As opposed to backward simulation methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo or simulated method of moments, these forward simulators are very easy to construct. This simplicity greatly reduces the development time in econometric modeling. In the second direction of\tadvance, very flexible distributional assumptions will be used to permit the data, as opposed to arbitrary but technically convenient assumptions, to drive inference. These assumptions include multivariate normal mixture models with conditional dependence on covariates or state variables. Restrictions from economic theory, such as concavity, can be\r\nimposed in these models by means of appropriate prior distributions and Markov chain\r\nMonte Carlo posterior simulation methods.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project significantly enhance the capabilities for empirical work in economics, and related disciplines like sociology and political science. The outcome of the project will include state-of-the-art, user friendly software that will be made freely available. This software, in turn, will become part of a web-based educational and software system being developed in this and related projects. Graduate student participation in the project is essential to these outcomes, and will be complementary to\r\nthese students' dissertation research.\r\n",
