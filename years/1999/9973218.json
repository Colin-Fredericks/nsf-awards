 "awd_abstract_narration": "9973218\r\n\r\nThe proposer's main objective is to resolve some theoretical and computational issues in developing innovative and efficient numerical methods for solving constrained minimization problems that can be reformulated as unconstrained minimization of piecewise quadratic functions.  More specifically, the proposer's objectives are the following: (i) identifying constrained minimization problems that can be converted to the unconstrained minimization of convex piecewise quadratic functions; (ii) designing numerical algorithms for solving the unconstrained reformulation problem that take advantage of the structure of the original problem; (iii) developing matrix factorization and matrix updating techniques for solving symmetric (but possibly singular) systems of linear equations; and (iv) establishing error bounds that are useful for convergence analysis of numerical algorithms for solving certain minimax problems for convex quadratic functions.  The potential impact of the project is an innovation on how quadratic programming problems should be solved in sequential quadratic programming methods as well as in trust region methods for solving constrained minimization problems.  The theory on new merit functions will provide a completely new perspective on how constraints should be handled in solving constrained minimization problems.  The new penalty function theory also serves as a theoretical basis for developing new methods for solving constrained minimization problems.  New techniques for finding a descent Newton direction when the Hessian of an objective function is only positive semidefinite will significantly advance the theory on Newton methods and allow people to use Newton methods to find a minimizer of a convex piecewise quadratic function in finitely many iterations, even though the set of all minimizers might be unbounded.  New error bounds will provide new ways to establish convergence results for some numerical algorithms.\r\n\r\nQuadratic programming is the key for solving constrained minimization problems that have significant applications in many areas such as bio-engineering, chemical engineering, aircraft design, etc.  For example, a faster and more accurate way of solving certain constrained minimization problems means a shorter and more efficient design cycle in developing new aircraft for Boeing.  This project aims at using an innovative approach for solving large-scale quadratic programming problems that can be used to obtain accurate solutions of constrained minimization problems efficiently. This will lead to better software tools for solving many engineering application problems.\r\n",
