 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of new chiral catalysts.  Neutral bis(oxazoline) bidentate and pyridine-bis(oxazoline) tridentate ligands will be employed in conjunction with cationic copper (2+) and tin (2+) for the generation of new families of chiral Lewis acids.  These chiral complexes will be investigated in the enantioselective catalysis of ene reactions, hetero Diels-Alder reactions, Michael reactions and sigmatropic rearrangements.  In addition, chiral metal complexes having a tailored binding pocket for catalysis of the aldol reaction will be pursued as will general strategies for the catalytic generation of chiral metal enolates. Enantioselective methods for the reduction of alpha- and beta-keto esters will also be developed.  Extensive use of X-ray crystallography will be carried out in order to probe catalyst structure.  \r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. David A. Evans of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University.  Professor Evans will focus his work on developing new stereoselective reactions with an emphasis on absolute stereochemical control through asymmetric catalysis.  Relevant target-oriented natural products syntheses will be pursued to illustrate the generality of the reactions being developed.  The work has important implications for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and  in the fields of medicine, biology and materials science.",
