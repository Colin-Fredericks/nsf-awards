 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chabot Observatory & Science Center (COSC), located in Oakland, California, will work closely with a Planning and Advisory Council of educational organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The goal of this work will be to plan a multi-year collaboration aimed at increasing the involvement of middle and high school girls in academic and extracurricular activities relating to technology.\r\n   Planning will be done in collaboration with the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), California State University,  Hayward (CSUH), Community Resources for Science, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and the Autodesk Foundation.\r\n   The goal of the project to be planned - tentatively named Techbridge - will be to create a learning environment that is likely to succeed in getting girls interested in technology.  The program will use a variety of strategies to create or reinforce support systems across the girls' daily experience and will include the girls' teachers, parents, counselors, as well as role models and mentors from industry.\r\n   Special attention will be paid to collecting, analyzing,  and applying to the program, data regarding the influence of culture on girls' involvement in technology.  In Oakland, one of the most diverse cities in the Nation,  this issue is critically important, as it is in urban centers nationwide.\r\n   The core activity for the students will be after-school clubs at each of the participating middle and high schools.  Girls in each club will work with a team of two teachers from their school.  Each club will choose a project that uses various applications of technology to help address a need or answer questions related to the community.\r\n   COSC will conduct intensive training for the teachers at the participating schools, and training for and interaction with school counselors.  Special focus will be given to enhancing a Career Explorations and Technology course required of all ninth graders in OUSD.\r\n",
