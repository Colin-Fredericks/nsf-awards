 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to use the bilingual as a vehicle to \r\nilluminate basic cognitive processes that serve as the interface between \r\nmemory and language. Because bilinguals typically have at least two \r\nwords available for any given concept, one in each of their languages, \r\nthe process by which they select the appropriate word to speak provides \r\na useful tool for investigating language production and competition \r\nacross cognitive systems. Recent research on the way in which bilinguals \r\nunderstand and produce words in their two languages suggests that both \r\nlanguages are always active to some degree. How then do bilinguals \r\nmanage to speak words in the intended language most of the time? The \r\nspecific focus of the planned research is to examine the factors that \r\nmodulate the competition that occurs when the bilingual's two \r\nlanguages are active. The experiments have two aims. One is to identify \r\nthe conditions that give rise to cross-language competition. Each of the \r\nproposed experiments involves spoken language production in the first \r\nlanguage (L1), the second language (L2), or under mixed conditions in \r\nwhich the two languages are directly competing with one another. A \r\nsecond aim of the proposed experiments is to identify the factors that \r\nmodulate the activity of each language. These factors are hypothesized \r\nto include external cues that serve to signal one of the bilingual's two \r\nlanguages as well as internal attentional strategies that function to \r\ncontrol the consequences of activation from the unintended language. \r\nThe results of this work will have specific implications for models of \r\nbilingual language processing but will also provide important \r\nconstraints for understanding the way in which skilled performance is \r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\n",
