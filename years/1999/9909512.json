The competition is being managed by the CSIDC Committee of the IEEE Computer Society.  The competing teams are tasked with design and implementation of a selected prototype system that addresses a common problem.  Teams are made up of three-to-five full-time undergraduate students who attend the same college or university.  Each team receives a project kit, which consists of a number of hardware and software components, given by co-sponsoring technology companies.  Teams work under the supervision of a faculty advisor over a three to four month period.\r\n\r\nThe projects are judged according to the team's ability to achieve the design objective; the creativity of the project; the project's usability, marketability, and maintainability; the choice of trade-offs made; and other factors.  The detailed judging criteria are published in advance of the competition and each project is judged by one of several three-person evaluation teams.  Each evaluation team evaluates five submissions and identifies the top two to a nine-person judging panel.  The panel selects the top ten teams who advance to the Finals.  The top five winners and five honorable mentions receive monetary awards.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides partial funding to assist with the costs of administering and running the competition for its first two years.  It is planned that the project will become self-sufficient in future years.\r\n",
