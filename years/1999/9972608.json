Recent work suggests that habitat is the most important determinant of  presence and abundance of animals. Animals usually use a variety of habitats and may depend on use of low-quality areas, areas in which they are not abundant or which do not appear to support production and rearing of young. The proposed research will test several ways in which use of lower quality habitat may benefit animals. Low-quality habitat may temporarily support survival of juveniles that subsequently reside in higher-quality habitat, may provide habitat for males that mate with females that live in nearby higher-quality areas, or may vary in quality in years of differing weather and sometimes be better than currently high-quality areas. The research goals will be achieved by following the behavior and reproduction of pikas (Onchotona princeps) through the use of radio-telemetry to monitor long-distance dispersal or death. The result will be to learn how animals differ in use of habitats and what the consequences of those differences are for survival and reproduction. Age- and sex-specific measurements of birth, death, and movements will be analyzed using population models to estimate the benefits of different patterns of habitat use. \r\n\r\nThis work will improve understanding of the value of a variety of habitats to a small mammal that  provides a model system for studying animal habitat use. Additionally, the work provides valuable information for game and non-game wildlife managers, other natural resource decision-makers, and land-owners who must understand the ways in which land sustains populations of animals. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
