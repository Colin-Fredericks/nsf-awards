Specifically, a volumetric frequency domain object representation (VFR) introduced by the PI will be used, which encapsulates both viewer centered and object centered  representations. The VFR includes a continuum of the views of the objects as 2-D slices of  the original  representation. This  view representation is based on the Fourier Slice Theorem. Previous frequency   domain representations were developed  for  two dimensional images and did not consider the three  dimensional object structure. Conventional  2-D frequency domain or spatial domain image representations for vision tasks is limited to 2-D interpretation. On the other hand,  the proposed approach considers  the  full  three dimensional object structure and  therefore can  handle  diverse  problems  such  as  viewpoint or\r\nillumination independent  recognition,  articulated  3-D motion, etc.  The VFR includes not only a continuum of object appearances but also 3-D structural information. Thus, 3-D object structure can be  derived  from  single images.  Pose  invariant  and  illumination  invariant object  recognition can be implemented using the VFR by directly indexing  into a complex  (real and imaginary) volumetric eigenvector  space. Two approaches  are  proposed  for  motion estimation.  The result  would be either a temporal sequence of  3-D poses  which  explicitly  define  the motion or a 3-D motion flow field. This 3-D approach avoids the problems of 2-D flow fields, especially  in the estimation of 3-D rotational motions where the actual motion vectors exhibit themselves as projections onto the image plane.  It is also planned to extend the VFR model towards several vision applications, such as image segmentation based  on 3-D  structure, pose invariant and illumination invariant object and face recognition, 3-D surface recovery  from  single image and  articulated motion recognition.\r\n",
