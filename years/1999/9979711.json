 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of a method to improve automated design procedures through use of a diagnostic methodology to help designers handle situations where the computer simulations used in the design are not exact.  Modern design methods use computational simulations from a variety of disciplines simultaneously.  In principle this leads to much better designs in much less time.  In practice, the computer simulations are not completely accurate, and the accuracy will vary for different designs.  When embedded in automated systems it becomes difficult to assess the level of uncertainty arising from these simulations.  The uncertainties often appear as irregularities in the results.  Numerical optimization procedures have problems in this situation, unknowingly exploiting the weaknesses of the simulations to produce poor designs.   The research will develop a method to use discrepancies between simulations of varying fidelity and empirical data to identify when the design process is using poor simulation results to make design decisions and suggest means to correct the situation.  The method will use modern statistical methods and simulation models to identify areas of high uncertainty and to attempt to repair the simulation. \r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of the research will lead to procedures that can be incorporated into an automated design process to improve confidence in design quality, provide an indication of the uncertainty associated with the design and reduce product design time.  The method will be developed for vehicle design using simultaneous fluid dynamics and structures as the key disciplines for multidisciplinary shape and structural design.  The uncertainty techniques will be applicable to design in related areas where the design methodology is based upon computer simulations.",
