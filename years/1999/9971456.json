This theoretical project will apply the methods of statistical mechanics and nonequilibrium dynamics to elucidate the statistics and phase diagram of DNA and protein sequence matching problems.  In a series of recent studies it has been found that the widely used sequence alignment algorithms, e.g., the Smith-Waterman algorithm, are analogous to some familiar problems in statistical physics, namely, the pinning of a directed path in random and correlated media, and the nonequilibrium roughening of growing surfaces in a noisy environment.  This analogy suggests an approach to sequence alignment that is very different from the current one taken in computational biology.  New analytical methods will be developed to calculate the approximate form of the phase diagram and the magnitude of various charcteristic scales for the alignment of random and mutually correlated sequences.  The shift in phase diagram due to sequence correlations will be used to pinpoint the optimal parameter regime for detecting homologous sequences.  Also, an empirical method will be used to extract the rare-event statistics quickly from the alignment of individual sequence pairs (rather than collecting statistics from an ensemble, say, via the random shuffling of sequences).  This method should lead to efficient determination of the statistical significance of each alignment. Subsequent optimization of this significance value by varying score parameters should then yield the desired high-fidelity alignment sensitive to weak sequence homologies.  Extension of existing algorithms to take into account long-range intra-sequence correlations, long segments of insertion/deletions, and multiple regions of near-optimal matchings will also be studied.  Lastly, the conceptual approach and mathematical methods being developed for sequence alignment can also be applied to understand the physical association of long DNA molecules.  The latter suggests a number of novel problems of statistical mechanics which are interesting to study in their own right.  This subject provides an excellent training ground for a new generation of interdisciplinary physicists, who will learn and apply the sophisticated methods of modern statistical mechanics, and at the same time, appreciate and discover interesting current problems in molecular biology.\r\n \r\nThis is a new grant funded jointly by the Divisions of Materials Research and Molecular and Cellular Biology with the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Science's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
