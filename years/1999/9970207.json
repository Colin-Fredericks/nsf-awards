The facility will be established on the Homewood campus of the Johns Hopkins University, where there are currently no such facilities.  The equipment will enable the researchers to  collect x-ray diffraction data from macromolecular crystals.  From this data, three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and complexes of proteins or of protein and nucleic acid can be determined.  Analysis of the structures will provide insight into the functions of the molecules, and this structural information will complement data collected using a variety of other techniques.  Among the topics being\r\nstudied by the research groups include:   How the binding of certain proteins leads to development of neural cells and the nervous system.   How to identify compounds that can prevent gelation of sickle cell\r\nhemoglobulin, which may lead to a treatment for sickle cell anemia.  How proteins involved in bacterial conjugation, a DNA transfer mechanism, combine their activities to transfer genes between bacteria .  How proteins can recognize and bind DNA and thereby activate or repress gene expression.  How proteins can recognize and bind RNA.  How proteins work together to allow bacteria to take up sugars from their environment.  How proteins can remain stable despite large modifications such as  large insertions or charges within the protein core.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
