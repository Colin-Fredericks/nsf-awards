 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to construct courses at University of Missouri-Rolla, by adapting best practices of other institutions in modular engineering curricula development.  Each module consists of background material and technical information on a particular engineering-related topic. The modules also contain related simulations and visual effects for graphically observing basic concepts related to the technical information.  Using a modular approach, courses are rapidly updated to include new topics, incorporate research findings, and introduce information from industry or other universities. \r\n\r\nIn this project, a modular-based approach is adapted to develop hardware experiments to educate undergraduate students in the design of power electronic based systems (PEBS). The hardware-based modules are to be used in the undergraduate power electronics and machines/drives laboratories to introduce students to the fundamental semiconductor devices, converter topologies, electric machines, and control techniques used in PEBS design. In addition, they are to be used in a senior-level elective machines and drives course and an introductory electromagnetic compatibility course to introduce topics in system stability, power quality, high frequency parasitic characterization of machines and power electronics, and EMI/EMC mitigation techniques. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the hardware-based modules are to: \r\n1.  provide experiments and an environment for students to develop the knowledge and skills required to design and implement power electronics based systems,\r\n2.  provide a means of transferring faculty research into the undergraduate curriculum, and \r\n3.  increase interest in power engineering by exposing students from other areas of electrical engineering to the multi-faceted area of power electronics based system design.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these goals, innovative hardware and software that has been designed by faculty and graduate students are built by undergraduate students and incorporated into the instructional modules. Results are to be disseminated to other institutions through on-line module manuals, circuit schematics, and models.  \r\n",
