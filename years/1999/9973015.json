 "awd_abstract_narration": "Next generation networks will support transmission rates that are orders of magnitute higher\r\nthan current rates.  Moreover, they will support a large variety of applications with different band-\r\nwidth and quality of service (QoS) requirements.  In particular, they must have the capability of\r\nsimultaneously supporting highly bursty delay-insensitive data traffic (e.g. file transfer), high-rate\r\ndelay-sensitive sessions (e.g. high quality video), and a large variety of heterogeneous services and\r\napplications in between.  To meet these requirements, next generation networks would need to\r\nbe implemented using packet switches that can scale to very high speed (e.g. aggregate speed of\r\nmulti-terabit per second) and can simultaneously support heterogeneous QoS for a large number\r\n(hundreds of thousands) of ows.\r\n     While traditional packet switches based on shared-memory or output-queued architectures can\r\nhandle today's bandwidth (multi-gigabit/sec) requirement, they cannot scale to a large number of\r\nflows and to very high speed (e.g. multi-terabit/sec).  On the other hand, input-queued architectures\r\nhave much better scalability properties and perhaps are the only feasible design option to implement\r\nswitches at very high speed.  However, supporting heterogeneous QoS to a large number of fl ows\r\nwith input-queued switches requires more complex scheduling algorithms, which can become the\r\nperformance bottleneck.\r\n     The proposed research project aims to design and analyze scalable scheduling algorithms for\r\npacket switches that can support heterogeneous QoS to a large number of flows at very high\r\nspeed.  In particular, the project will focus on fundamental scheduling issues involved in input-\r\nqueued switches with the switch fabric being a crossbar or multiple crossbars.  In addition to the\r\nstudy of QoS (e.g. delay, bandwidth guarantee, fairness) to individual flows, the project will also\r\naddress issues in scheduling multicast flows, the interaction between scheduling and queue over flow\r\nmanagement, and packet discarding algorithms.  Theoretical and simulation studies will be involved.\r\nThe proposed research will yield a new understanding of the performance limits in packet switching\r\nand the fundamental tradeoff between the scheduling complexity and the achievable QoS.",
