The first involves careful experimental characterization of well chosen systems and the second invokes atomistic level simulations of molecular motions.  Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy is the principal experimental tool to be employed as it allows measurements over an extremely broad temporal range.  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which generate atom positions over a time trajectory are to be used to study molecular motions in the same systems as studied experimentally.  The specific probems to be addressed concern the following.  The aromatic polyester poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has prominent relaxation below it glass transition.  The molecular motions underlying it are not understood.  Its close relative poly(ethylene naphthylate) (PEN) has two such processes and thus is even less understood.  Thorough dielectric characterization of both the subglass processes and the glass transition region is to be carried out on both polymers and their copolymers.  Special attention is to be given to the high frequency, short time region where direct comparisons with MD simulations on the same systems can be made.  Another system for study will be linear aliphatic polyester copolymers.  Both the subglass processes and glass transition region where direct comparisons with MD simulations on the same systems can be made.  Another system for study will be linear aliphatic polyester copolymers.  Both the subglass processes and glass transition region will be investigated.  Companion MD simulations are to be made.  Simulation efforts on liquid crystalline wholly aromatic polyesters will be continued as well.  In all of these areas a considerably more detailed understanding of how relaxation processes and molecular motions are connected will evolve.\r\n\r\nThe chemical industry of the United States is an important segment of the nation's economy.  It is one of the segments that continues to contribute a positive balance in international trade.  Its backbone is the manufacture and processing of polymers.  These materials have become interwoven into every aspect of everyday life.  Their behavior, and hence the choice of a given material for a given application, depends sensitively on the presence of relaxation processes.  The latter are well defined regions of temperature and time over which properties change, often dramatically.  The presence of the processes is due to the onset of various types of molecular motions with increasing temperature.  In order to rationally tailor existing materials for new applications and design new ones, it is important that relaxations be understood at the most fundamental level possible.  This requires understanding of the underlying molecular motions.  Achieving this insight is an important goal of polymer science.\r\n",
