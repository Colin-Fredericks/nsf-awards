 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a perception among certain members of the artificial intelligence community that the logic-based approach to AI has not been sufficiently recognized as important at  NSF. This workshop will bring together leading researchers in the logic-based AI community, to provide them with an opportunity to exchange information in their sub-disciplines, to learn about related work in logic-based AI, and to assess the direction of the field as a whole. A report to NSF will describes important current themes in the field which are worthy of research support, and will provide an assessment of an area of research that some of the leading figures in artificial intelligence believe to be among the most promising for significant future advances.  NSF funds will be used to partially support attendees who do not have sufficient funds to come otherwise, as well as a small number of student attendees; no funds will be used for overhead or for the PIs. The University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies will contribute approximately $5,000 to defray the charge for use of the conference rooms, to provide preprints of papers, and for other incidentals.",
