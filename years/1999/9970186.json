 "awd_abstract_narration": "Award Abstract - 9970186\r\nThis multi-user group award funds the acquisition of equipment at Eastern Michigan University (EMU) for the digitalization of images from electrophoretic gels, the accurate quantification of the DNA, RNA, and proteins in those gels, and the production of high quality figures for the dissemination of results.  EMU has facilities that support research in most aspects of molecular biology, including cell biology, genetics, developmental biology, immunology, and microbiology.  Prior to this award, however, there was no rapid, economical method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of DNA, RNA and protein.  The new equipment will not only allow such quantitative and qualitative analysis, but the versatility of the equipment will also allow investigators to develop alternative methodologies to radioisotope detection of macromolecules.  This is a very important consideration, given the increasing participation of undergraduate students in research at EMU. \r\nThe principal  investigators from the departments of Biology and Chemistry who will use this equipment comprise a multidisciplinary group with research interests in the fields of developmental biology, ecology, molecular evolution, immunology, cell biology, and microbiology.  The major research projects that will utilize this equipment include: a) an investigation of receptor function in early amphibian development, b) a study of the genetic parentage of a hybrid cattail, c) an analysis of the evolutionary history of interspersed DNA elements in rodents, d) an examination of immunosuppression by an animal papillomavirus, and e) a study of the structural organization of eukaryotic detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450.  In addition to supporting faculty research, this instrument will enhance the training of undergraduate and Master's level students in the application of molecular biology tools in a wide variety of fields.  Thus, the equipment will have a profound impact on the research infrastructure of the EMU.  \r\n",
