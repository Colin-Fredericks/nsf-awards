Based on the conclusions and progress of this research, it is expected that we will be able to determine future paths of research, especially directed toward commercialization of products that incorporate analog VLSI-based pre-processing onto existing auditory processing systems. It is certainly possible that conclusions of this research might suggest a degree of futility in combining analog VLSI with DSP for these applications. Even in this worst case sce-nario, however, we expect that valuable insight into the potential of analog-VLSI circuits for auditory and other non-visual processing applications will be gained from the research.\r\n\r\nThe exploratory research we propose is divided into:\r\n\r\nUnderstanding and applying a particular DSP Architecture (Analog Devices 2100 series) to simple auditory processing problems\r\nImproving the design and implementation of compact, highly tunable bandpass filters in analog VLSI to suit the strengths of the DSP.\r\nCombining the DSP and improved analog VLSI front-end to process simple auditory signals\r\nComparing the performance of analog VLSI, DSP, and mixed signal systems in processing these same auditory signals in terms of power, space, anticipated cost, and recognition accuracy.  \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
