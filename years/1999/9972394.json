 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the current education of engineers in the subjects of applied mechanics and materials science. Although these two fields are  increasingly linked in the research and industrial communities, this trend has not filtered down to the engineering curriculum in most universities. Applied mechanics and materials science are often taught by different departments, each with vastly different goals, focus, and language; direct relationships between these intrinsically connected subjects are infrequently included in course material.\r\n\r\nThis project links these disciplines in the engineering curriculum through 1.  a model for integrating currently disparate courses in the typical undergraduate engineering curriculum, building on successful preliminary results; 2.  courseware for use in engineering courses that takes advantage of recent innovations in scientific research and instructional technology; 3.  foundation basis for developing, at a future time, graduate curricula that based on the integration and synthesis of mechanics and materials; and 4. use of the Internet, interactive media, and workshops to bring the two communities in instructional academe together in content and effective learning methodologies.\r\n",
