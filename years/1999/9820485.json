 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Sciences at Duquesne University will establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site involving ten students per summer for three years. Through their participation in research and other activities, our undergraduate researchers will gain an understanding of the process of science, the activities and duties of scientists, and the importance of cellular and molecular approaches in addressing questions across broad areas in the biological sciences. Mentors for the participants are an enthusiastic and qualified team of faculty who have the resources and facilities necessary for outstanding research in cellular and molecular biology. They are all committed to working directly with students, and all have a proven record of mentoring undergraduate researchers. Because of this experience with undergraduate research, our faculty mentors have designed a number of projects that will take students with little or no research experience to a point where they may become independent. In our recruiting, we will target a diverse pool of potential participants, early in their undergraduate education, and mainly from small regional colleges and universities. Special efforts will be made to continue our success in recruiting underrepresented minority students and women to our summer research program. Weekly meetings will take place during the ten-week program to exchange ideas about scientific, philosophical, and practical aspects of research and careers in research. The program will culminate in a Summer Research Symposium modeled after scientific meetings, and attended by students and faculty from Duquesne University and other regional institutions. By providing a rigorous and rewarding experience for our summer research students, our program will have a positive impact by encouraging them to continue toward careers in biological research. The effectiveness of the program will be assessed by student participant and faculty evaluations and through the long-term monitoring of the students' careers.",
