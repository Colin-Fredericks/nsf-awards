 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tomorrow's system software must provide efficient resource management across\r\na range of operating environments, and hence needs to adapt its policies\r\ndynamically to suit its changing environment. Currently such adaptation is\r\nhampered by modular software architectures that prevent informed adaptation\r\nby hiding all implementation details. This proposal advocates a new\r\napproach to building software that enables cooperative adaptation by the use\r\nof symbiotic interfaces. A symbiotic interface extends a system's\r\napplication programming interface (API) to incorporate high-level\r\nabstractions designed to both better support the application's needs while\r\nsimultaneously giving the system the information it needs to adapt its\r\npolicies. A symbiotic interface encapsulates user level semantics to improve\r\nsupport for the application, and thus improves usability of the\r\nsystem. Capturing user-level semantics through the interface discloses\r\ninformation to the system, so it can make informed decisions on how to adapt\r\nto better suit the application's needs. Like symbiotic relationships in\r\nnature, the symbiotic interface allows mutually beneficial cooperation\r\nbetween the application and system. Professor Steere's educational plan\r\ninvolves creating advanced courses in systems architecture that focus on\r\nbuilding adaptive and predictable systems, beginning with a survey course on\r\nmobile computing that concludes with a project in building adaptive software.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
