 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a research-based developmental biology program affecting students in introductory, intermediate, and advanced courses at Macalester College.  The primary objective of this project is to support the design and addition of research-based laboratories in Developmental Biology throughout the biology curriculum, but especially in the new intermediate and advanced level classes, Developmental Biology, and Research in Developmental Biology.  Laboratory modules are adapted from \"The Developmental Biology Teaching Laboratory\" workshop led by L. Johnson at the Darling Marine Center which introduced several developmental investigations.  By using research-grade microscopes with a video-imaging system dedicated to student research, this project supports enhanced demonstration capabilities in a minimum of three courses, greater comprehension of scientific methods and principles by potential science majors in an introductory cell biology course, proficiency in several sophisticated techniques in the intermediate developmental biology course, and the enhancement of senior level research (enrolling up to a total of 42 students per year).  In the courses affected by this project, students are introduced to one or several model organisms and contemporary techniques used to study the organism's development, including vital dye staining, immunocytochemistry, microsurgery, in situ hybridization, and reverse genetics.  The comprehension of developmental and cell biology is being enhanced by the use of video-imaging capabilities that can demonstrate and store for retrieval, study, and comparison the different stages of the life cycle of the organism under study as well as microsurgical and staining techniques.  Improved comprehension and mastery of these techniques result in increased technical expertise later in the course and in potentially more sophisticated developmental biology research.  Finally, the research grade microscopes with imagining capabilities enhance the quality of undergraduate research publications and presentations.",
