 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861082\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase l project will explore inherently low cost, mass-producable conductive composite materials for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Current PEM fuel cell bipolar plates often achieve good overall technical performance, but have some combination of high materials, manufacturing and assembly cost. This high cost is a barrier to market penetration of fuel cells. In order to develop a fuel cell bipolar plate, which has acceptable technical performance as well as low cost, novel composite materials amenable to low cost manufacture needs to be developed. These novel materials will be used to design exceptional bipolar plates through an integrated, interdisciplinary engineering design approach. In Phase I, novel composite materials amenable to low cost manufacture of fuel cell bipolar plates will be identified through a material-testing program. This program will specifically include the effects of low-cost manufacture on the material properties.\r\n     Successful completion of the project will lead to low cost, mass-manufacturable fuel cell stacks, thereby enhancing United States competitiveness in the emerging markets for fuel cells and leading to greatly accelerated market penetration of fuel cells, especially in low cost applications such as light duty vehicles.\r\n",
