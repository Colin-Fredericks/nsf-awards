 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Pseudomonas 1999- The Seventh International Congress on Pseudomonas: Biotechnology and Pathogenesis\" is to be held September 1-5, 1999 at Maui, Hawaii. The goal of this conference, is to bring together scientists from around the world with different sub-specialties that are relevant to Pseudomonas research. The genus Pseudomonas applies to gram-negative, nonenteric, generally non-fermenting, motile, aerobic bacteria. P. fluorescens, P. syringae, and Ralstonia (formerly Pseudomonas) solanacearum, are significant for their effects on plants. Some of these can infect plants and cause disease, while others can protect their hosts by the production of antibiotic compounds that prevent fungal infections. Additional environmental Pseudomonads, such as P. putida, can degrade various pollutants, including chloroaromatic and nitroaromatic compounds, and thus these bacteria have potential bioremediation applications; the metabolism of some of these compounds can also lead to the production of reagents of commercial value. Thus, the general topic of Pseudomonas research spans a number of disciplines, including plant pathology, environmental microbiology, metabolism, cell biology, and gene regulation. Many of the approaches, techniques, and analyses used span across these disciplines, however few venues are available to promote the interactions between the scientists in these diverse fields. At Pseudomonas 1999, the session topics and poster presentations will be organized to integrate these various topics, rather than to separate them.  It is anticipated that the format of this International Congress on Pseudomonas, as with the six previous meetings, will encourage the intermingling of scientists to find common interests, share new technologies, and develop fruitful collaborations across the various fields related to Pseudomonas. A concerted effort is being made to include younger scientists, women, minorities, and persons with disabilities \r\n",
