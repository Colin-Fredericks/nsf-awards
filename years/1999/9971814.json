The proposed research is concerned in particular with the exploration and development of new principles for the design of statistical software to take advantage of modern computing power.  This work explores the use of compilation and multi-threading in statistical computing.  It examines the advantages of different language forms, including graphical languages, for expressing statistical ideas. Principles for developing effective systems for dynamic graphical explorations are also explored.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to improve the ability of researchers, instructors, and other users of statistical methodology to apply statistical methods in new problem areas.  The proposed research is concerned in particular with the exploration and development of new principles for the design of statistical software to take advantage of modern computing power.  This work examines how to build on new developments in computer science to allow statistical data analysis to take full advantages of the speed and graphics capabilities made available by advances in computer hardware.  The insights and methods developed in this research will lead to improvements in the practice and the teaching of statistical ideas within mathematics, engineering, and other areas of technological education.\r\n",
