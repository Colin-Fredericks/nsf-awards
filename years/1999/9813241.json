 "awd_abstract_narration": "Viscoelastic fluids are fluids which in addition to possessing viscous and elastic properties, also have memory. They abound in a wide range of technological  applications such as molten plastics, polymer solutions, paints, and  body fluids.  Due to their complex microstructure, the equations describing these fluids are also very complex. Only in the recent past  have fundamental analytical questions of existence, uniqueness, and qualitative behavior of solutions  been systematically addressed. Many of these insights have\r\ndirectly contributed to successes in numerical simulations.   Although great strides have been made during these years many challenges still remain.\r\n\r\nMichael Renardy's research on the mathematical modeling of viscoelastic fluids places him at the forefront of this very important subject. He has an international reputation  and  possesses both a very broad view\r\nand profound  knowledge of the subject.  As a coauthor  of the research monograph \"Mathematical Theory of Viscoelasticity\" (1987) and the graduate text ``An Introduction to Partial Differential Equations'' (1993), as well as numerous research articles on viscoelastic flows, he is uniquely qualified to provide an overview of the major developments in the subject during the past two decades and to indicate  directions for the future to an interdisciplinary audience.\r\n\r\nThis conference is expected to stimulate interest and spur activities in research on  the mathematical and computational  analysis of viscoelastic fluids by bringing together both established researchers and newcomers from academia and industry.\r\n",
