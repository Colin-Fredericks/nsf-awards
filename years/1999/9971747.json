In \r\nthe first part sufficient conditions for optimality of abnormal extremals \r\nwill be investigated in the context of field theory. A generalization of the \r\nperturbation feedback control law that allows incorporating abnormal \r\ntrajectories into the classical framework will be used to construct a local \r\nregular synthesis around an abnormal reference extremal. These \r\nconstructions should shed some light on the connections between optimal \r\nabnormal extremals and singularities (including discontinuities) in the \r\nvalue function for the problem. It is expected that this part of the project \r\nwill contribute to both theory and application of perturbation feedback \r\ncontrol, regular synthesis, and sufficient conditions of optimality by \r\nproviding generalizations that complement the classical results and \r\nbecome important new tools in applications. The second part addresses \r\nprecise and complete solutions to a class of nonlinear optimal control \r\nproblems in low dimensions arising in mathematical models for cancer \r\nchemotherapy. In the models the cell cycle is controlled by clustering its \r\ndifferent phases into compartments and using phase specific killing agents. \r\nIn this project a full analysis of two- and three-compartment models will \r\nbe pursued. So far these models were only analyzed numerically, but no \r\nqualitative or analytic results about the structure of optimal controls have \r\nbeen obtained. It is expected that these results, interesting also from a \r\ntheoretical point of view, will find applications in mathematical models \r\nfor scheduling cancer chemotherapy protocols.\r\n\r\nThe project consists of two parts which both address the question of \r\nfinding full solutions to optimal control problems arising in applications. \r\nThe first construction is motivated by the perturbation feedback control \r\nscheme, a classical tool in engineering, especially in aircraft control \r\ndesign. The proposed construction aims to incorporate so-called abnormal \r\ntrajectories for which the conventional scheme is ineffective. It is expected \r\nthat this part of the project will contribute to both theory and application \r\nby providing generalizations that complement the classical results and \r\nbecome important new tools in applications. In the second part of the \r\nproject models of optimal control of cancer chemotherapy will be \r\ninvestigated. The goal is to maximize the number of cancer cells that a \r\ncytostatic agent in the drug kills while keeping the toxicity to the normal \r\ntissue acceptable. Some of the models that were only analyzed \r\nnumerically before will be investigated in this project with the aim of \r\nobtaining a full analytic solution.  It is expected that these results, \r\ninteresting also from a theoretical point of view, will find applications in \r\nmathematical models for scheduling cancer chemotherapy protocols.\r\n",
