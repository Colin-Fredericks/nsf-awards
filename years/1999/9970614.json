 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9970614\r\n\r\nThe main interest of the PI is the study of resonances and of the wave \r\nequation. Resonances which are described by complex numbers constitute \r\na replacement of eigenvalues for problems on noncompact domains and they \r\nappear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics. The real part \r\nof a resonance describes the energy (or frequency) of a state and the \r\nimaginary part its rate of decay. This constitutes a more realistic model \r\nthan an eigenvalue which provides energy only and assumes eternal existence \r\nof a state. A new wealth of phenomena appears and our understanding is still \r\nrather fragmentary. Linear and non-linear wave equations describe many \r\nphysical phenomena often closely related to resonances. In the contexts \r\nof propagation, spectral and scattering theories the PI will investigate \r\nthem further. The specific directions include: understanding of the dynamical definition \r\nof resonances and their appearance in the long time behaviour of solutions \r\nof the wave and Schroedinger equations, obtaining lower bounds on \r\nthe number of resonances in terms of dynamical quantities, developing \r\nthe theory of the FBI transformation on non-compact manifolds with  \r\napplications to resonances and to the study of propagation for Schroedinger \r\nequation in mind, estimates of resonances at low energies, understanding of \r\n\"quantum chaos\" in scattering theory.\r\n\r\nFor a broad range of phenomena, a physical state can be described by two\r\nparameters: its rest energy and its rate of decay. This information is \r\nelegantly encoded in a complex number, whose real part is the energy and \r\nthe imaginary part, the rate of decay. This description of a state, called \r\na resonance, appears naturally in mathematics, physics and chemistry: from \r\nthe Riemann zeta function to experimental scattering data.\r\n\r\nThe PI studies general principles in the distribution of resonances,\r\ntheir relation to wave propagation, and their behaviour in various specific\r\nsituations. He is also interested in \"quantum chaos\", the study of which \r\nraises questions in many areas: from number theory to mezoscopic systems \r\nof physics. The main issues are universal relations between the classical \r\nand quantum views of the world -- one of the yet unresolved central themes \r\nof the 20th century.\r\n",
