Particular projects involve: (1) new techniques for rapid catalyst screening by adding catalyst directly onto the high temperature catalyst with instantaneous measurement of performance changes, (2) use of catalyst deposited directly onto parallel plates to achieve efficient heat transfer in very short time reactors and to run exothermic and endothermic reactions on opposite sides of a plate, (3) use of stratified and staged monolith reactors, and (4) new methods to obtain oxygenates directly by exploiting homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions by control of geometry, flow patterns, catalysts, and heat transfer in short contact time configurations.  This project involves the interplay of heterogeneous catalysis and homogeneous reactions along with reaction engineering issues to understand and develop new processes for the partial oxidation of light alkanes in small reactors at short contact times under conditions of very high reaction rates where the gradients in temperature and concentrations are extremely large.\r\n",
