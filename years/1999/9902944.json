 "awd_abstract_narration": "9902944\r\nGonsalves\r\n\r\nElectron projection lithography and, to some extent, X-Ray lithography suffer from electron proximity effects, which is highly detrimental to the critical dimension in integrated cirduits no matter how sophisticated the machines are.  The proposed new concept to virtually eliminate the electron proximity effects and to attain sub-100 nm resolution relies on the use of anisotropic resists based on inorganic nanotubes-polymer composites (NANOCOMPOSITES).  The original solution is to strongly reduce the lateral scattering of the secondary electrons by forcing them to follow vertical paths imposed by the columnated microstructure of the nanocomposite.  Three interrelated phases in the nanocomposite development can be distinguished: PHASE 1: the chemical synthesis of a series of high contrast, high sensitivity resists (core of the project).  Processing silicate-metal-surfactant mesophases by established liquid crystal mehtods and then polymerizing the inorganic component will be investigated for producing ordered organic-inorganic resists.  Nanocomposites will be prepared based on metal oxide/liquid crystal cores/nanoparticles with functionalized sufaces onto which PMMA oligomers can be grafted and engineered into 3D crystal like non-agglomerated structures.  The alignment  of the mesoscopic structures will also be examined in fluid media, such that the organic-inorganic resists can be spun on to a wafer, magnetically aligned and then frozen in the desired orientation after drying, i.e., in the direction of the e-beam.  The latter meets the criterion for strongly reducing the lateral scattering of secondary electrons by forcing them to follow veritcal paths imposed by the columnated microstructure of the anisotropic resis.  PHASE 2: resist characterization and fundamental study of radiation-nanocomposite interaction.  These materials will be characterized via thermal analysis, viz DSC and TGA for detemining their Tg and thermal stability, molecular weight by GPC; adhesion by peel and blister tests; rheology by viscometry; film formation by spin-coating and film thickness by ellopsometry and profilometry.  The stability of the resist materials will be analyzed for their resistance to acids and bases by IR spectroscopy.  SEM, TEM including HRTEM, AFM/STM will contribute to invaluable insight into the 3D structures of the inorganic-organic nanocomposite materials.  Fundamental radiation effects will be essentially followed by in situ FTIR spectroscopy of the nanocomposite maintained at variable Temperatures (LN2 to RT) and pressures.  PHASE 3: high resolution lithographic tests of the resists (Concurrent with 2).  Drawing a series of parallel lines (akin to a grating) separated by decreasing distances in the resist with a finely focused e-beam of a HRSEM will give an estimation of the resolution and, thus of the proximity effects in the resist.  Then a parallel broad e-beam (or X-Ray) flooding a mask will be used to test the resist.\r\n\r\nA major challenge facing the microelectronic industry is the mass production of integrated circuits having sub-100 nm critical dimentsions.  A clear-cut advantage of the proposed resist is that it might enable sub- 100 nm resolution to be readily attained by electron projection lithography and X-Rays lithography without modifying the existing industrial machines, which considerably could save development time and investment.\r\n",
