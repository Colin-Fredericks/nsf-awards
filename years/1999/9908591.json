Unfortunately, vein grafts often fail within months to years due to atherosclerosis. In spite of extensive investigations, it remains unclear why vein graft atherosclerosis occurs within such a short period. Recent research has demonstrated that a vein graft is exposed to a stretching force due to arterial blood pressure. This force is associated with early vascular cell death, followed by massive vascular cell growth, which contribute to vein graft atherosclerosis. This project is designed to investigate the mechanisms related to these events by using a cultured vein graft model.\r\n\r\nTo clarify how a stretching force induces vascular cell death and growth, rat jugular veins will be perfused with culture media to various pressure levels using a pulsatile cardiac pump to simulate vein grafts in a cell incubator. A relationship between the stretching force and the rate of cell death, as well as between the stretching force and the rate of cell growth, will be determined using a biomechanical approach; and the role of biochemical factors in the mediation of stretch-induced cell death and growth will be examined using biological approaches. The influence of the stretching force on cell death and growth will be distinguished from that of other factors, such as surgical trauma and altered blood flow. Attention will be also given to the relationship between vascular cell death and growth.\r\n\r\nData from these experiments will be analyzed and used to answer these questions: whether a stretching force plays a role in vascular cell death and growth; how cell death is related to cell growth; and what mechanisms are possibly involved. This project will provide fundamental information into the mechanisms of vein graft atherosclerosis and failure.\r\n",
