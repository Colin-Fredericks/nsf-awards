The launching point for this project is the principal  investigator's recent proof that may nonlinear dynamical systems con adaptively achieve a noise-based \"stochastic resonance\" where external noise improves the system signal-to-noise ratio or other performance measure.   The project will explore the nature of noise and how it affects many feedback (and perhaps feedforward) systems.  \r\n\r\nThe technical basis for this project rests on three claims:\r\n\r\n1. Noise can sometimes help computation: New research in \"stochastic resonance\" and elsewhere show that noise can help computation as well as hurt it;\r\n2. Noise is a free and local source of energy: Noise occurs at all scales in the universe and affects all physical systems involved in computation;\r\n3. Noise computation promises new algorithms and computational techniques: Signal \"crosstalk\" is a common source of noise in communication, biological, neural, financial, optical and many other systems.  The proposed research will explore many of these natural and engineering systems and attempt either to optimize the signal structure to best fit the noise benefits of the background crosstalk or to optimize or to at least shape the background crosstalk structure to best fit the signals that pass through it.\r\n",
