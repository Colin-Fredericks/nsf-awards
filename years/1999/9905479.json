 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the extent to which US industrial firms in the machine tool  (MT)  sector have been  adjusting to global competition  via  business  strategies  that  emphasize export-expansion  and/or  import-containment.  Particular  attention  is given to the role of product design and  product  policy  in  the commercial  performance  of  MT  firms  (both  exporters and non-exporters).  A national survey of US-owned MT manufacturers  will be  conducted  with  a view to constructing taxonomic models that can  accurately  discriminate  between  successful  versus   less successful firms in this industry.  A key hypothesis to be tested is that superior export performance and/or import-containment can be  traced  to  product  design  strategies  that emphasize close customer  involvement  at  the  early  stages  of   new   product development.  A related hypothesis is that regional variations in the  business  performance  of MT firms are likely to be present, reflecting  geographic   differences   in   local   techno-market conditions.  Specifically,  firms  located outside major clusters of  MT  production  are  expected  to  exhibit  weaker   business performance  than their counterparts located in core regions that contain large numbers of firms in similar or related industries. Data for the study will come from a postal survey of the entire national population of MT producers, as well as from follow-up interviews with a representative subsample of firms. Logistic regression and/or discriminant analysis will be used to predict successful versus less successful trade adjustment among respondents.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the project is  to  identify  those business strategies that best contribute to the commercial viability of US firms  in an import-competing sector (machine tools).  This is an important topic at this point in time,  if only  because  the  US machine  tool  industry  is  widely  viewed as being of strategic importance to other US industries  (notably  the  automotive  and aerospace sectors).  The project will highlight the effectiveness of different types of business  strategies  in  terms  of  export success  and/or adjustment to import competition.  The results of the project will be made available to  all  project  participants (i.e.  firms),  as  well  as to public policy agencies and the US Federal  government.  Ultimately,  the  project  is  designed  to supply strategic blueprints to US machine tool firms that want to compete successfully in the international marketplace.  \r\n\r\n",
