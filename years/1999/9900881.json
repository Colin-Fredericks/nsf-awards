 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on embedded systems design tools for building custom\r\napplication-specific instruction processor (ASIP) architectures that are no\r\nbigger, or no more complex than necessary. Developing an ASIP, not only\r\nrequires hardware design, but also requires the use of a set of evaluation\r\ntools such as an assembler, compiler and simulator. This investigation uses\r\na processor description to serve as a common starting point for the\r\ndevelopment of these tools, as well as for hardware synthesis. The ISDL\r\nlanguage, being developed at MIT, for exactly this purpose is being used in\r\ndeveloping a complete software development environment, as well as hardware\r\ngeneration. The simulator is used to obtain clock cycle estimates on\r\napplication code, and to evaluate the overall architecture performance.\r\nSynthesis of processor datapaths enables hardware generation and provides\r\naccurate, cycle-time estimates. To support software compilation, a\r\nretargetable assembler, code generator and optimizer will be developed that\r\nreceive as input both a machine description in ISDL, and the program to be\r\ncompiled onto the described machine. New optimizations to produce code of\r\nthe highest quality in a reasonable amount of time are being evaluated. The\r\nbase of our retargetable compiler is SPAM, an embedded compiler framework\r\nthat has been developed by researchers at MIT, Princeton and UNICAMP,\r\nBrazil. In many cases, application code is not written in high-level\r\nprogramming languages, and it is necessary to deal with assembly or legacy\r\ncode. Thus automatic methods for optimized binary-to-binary translation are\r\nbeing investigated. To do this, the legacy binary/assembly code is\r\ndecompiled to intermediate forms used by our compiler infrastructure and\r\nthen using the optimizing compiler technology to generate high-quality\r\nassembly for the target architecture.\r\n",
