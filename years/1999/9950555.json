 "awd_abstract_narration": "While nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is widely used in chemical research for purposes ranging from structural determination to measurements of dynamic processes, student access to such instruments at the undergraduate level is often limited due to high initial costs and ongoing expenses for cryogen and maintenance. In this project, the NMR is being used throughout the chemistry curriculum beginning in the first semester of general chemistry with simple measurements and progressing to more sophisticated experiments in the Advanced Chemistry Laboratory course, in undergraduate research, and in collaborations with local industry. Furthermore, faculty and students in organic chemistry classes at Kirkwood Community College and Mt. Mercy College, two nearby institutions that do not have NMRs, also are using the instrument. Students in an Advanced Placement (AP) Chemistry class from a local high school are gaining hands-on experience with the instrument as part of a unit on modern methods of structural determination which are being developed in collaboration with the AP Chemistry teacher. If successful, this collaboration will be expanded to AP Chemistry classes at other local high schools. Acquisition of this instrument is enhancing teaching and research, providing additional teaching resources to other local colleges, and providing opportunities for enhanced interaction between faculty at local colleges and secondary science educators.",
