 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nResults of more than sixty years of scientific investigation at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory have established the LTER site as a national and international center for forest ecosystem and hydrologic research.  When combined with other research activities, more than 150 investigators are currently conducting studies at Coweeta.  This tremendous site use by visiting investigators has greatly out-paced logistical support and there is a need to improve all aspects of Coweeta facilities.  A comprehensive multi-phase facilities plan has been developed to meet current and future research, education, and training needs.  The 2185-ha laboratory site, located in the southern Applalachian Mountains of North Carolina hosts cooperative research jointly administrated by the Southern Research Station (SRS) and the University of Georgia (UGA).  Within the past five years, the research program has substantially broadened to include regional analyses of causes and consequences of land-use change in the southern Appalachians as part of the LTER program.\r\n\r\nThis project will support the implementation of the Facilities Development Plan for the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory.  Specifically, the project will expand and renovate the present dormitory which will increase living space to accommodate 24 investigators and also better utilize existing space. \r\n",
