 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project employs a sophisticated research technique, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), to enhance undergraduate teaching.  PIV is more commonly used as a research tool to study fluid mechanics and convective heat transfer.  The techniques for the use of this tool to make full field, instantaneous, quantitative velocity measurements, after those of researchers at the University of Minnesota, Florida State University, and Lehigh University, will be adapted to undergraduate courses and laboratories in the thermal sciences.  These adaptations of courses and laboratories support Union College's philosophy of three stages of investigative learning designed to prepare students for collaborative research with faculty by the senior year.  This three stage program  includes introductory courses emphasizing hands-on activities as well as the fundamentals, mid-level courses focusing on research-like experiences through open-ended projects, and senior research experiences designed to sharpen inquiry skills.  The improvement of student ability to perform fluid mechanics and heat transfer design, the development of student intuition about the effects of fluid mechanics on heat transfer, and the potential to excite students about the thermal fluid sciences are expected project outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe PIV system will be integrated throughout the mechanical engineering curriculum at Union College and will serve as a model for enhancing the instruction of the thermal sciences throughout four year undergraduate mechanical engineering curricula.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
