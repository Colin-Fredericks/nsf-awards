Using\r\nfluorescent in situ hybridization techniques to paint various\r\nchromosomes different colors reveals a rich variety of simple and\r\ncomplex aberrations, each putatively indicative of two or more\r\nDNA double strand breaks involved in one over-all misrepair\r\nreaction.  The investigator undertakes calculations on the\r\nbiophysical implications of current data on aberrations, and of\r\npulsed-field gel-electrophoresis data on DNA double strand break\r\nclustering along chromosomes, relevant to the early stages of\r\naberration formation.  Three basic molecular models for DNA break\r\nmisrejoining are compared.  There are so many combinatorial\r\npossibilities for this misrejoining that theorems, equations, and\r\ncomputer simulations are needed for systematically interpreting\r\nthe extensive, elaborate current data.  The main methods are: (1)\r\nsuitably adapting standard results of probability theory and\r\nstochastic process theory, mainly on Poisson cluster point\r\nprocesses; and (2), extending CAS (chromosome aberration\r\nsimulator) computer software.  Collaborations with many different\r\nexperimental groups world-wide are continued.  Models that assume\r\nrandomness of break induction and misrepair can characterize with\r\nreasonable accuracy, using only two adjustable parameters, the\r\nrelative frequencies of many different types of aberrations and\r\ntheir dependence on genomic content of the chromosome arms\r\ninvolved.\r\n     Understanding the effects of ionizing radiation on cells is\r\nan important part of fundamental biology.  Chromosome aberrations\r\nare complex cellular endpoints, copiously produced by ionizing\r\nradiation and informative about basic mechanisms of DNA damage\r\nproduction, repair, and misrepair.  Aberrations are also robustly\r\nimplicated in the main areas of applied radiobiology, including\r\ncancer risk assessment, estimating cell killing during\r\nradiotherapy, and biodosimetry (i.e. judging past exposure of an\r\nindividual to radiation, e.g. after a radiation accident or an\r\nastronaut's mission).  Due to increased current interest and to\r\nimproved experimental techniques, there has been a flood of new\r\ndata on radiation-induced aberrations.  The investigator studies\r\nthe underlying biophysics of chromosome aberration formation,\r\nusing state-of-the-art mathematical and computer methods.  His\r\nmethods discriminate between the three current molecular models\r\nof aberration formation, which are needed mainly to predict\r\nlevels of radiation damage in situations not yet measured\r\nexperimentally, such as doses too low to be readily tractable in\r\nlaboratory analyses but nonetheless of possible concern for large\r\npopulations.  Mathematical and computer modeling is a\r\ncomparatively inexpensive way to maximize biological information\r\nobtainable from the rapidly increasing databases and to help\r\nguide experiments.\r\n\r\n",
