 "awd_abstract_narration": "Huntington\r\n9908449\r\n\r\nThis project is to support a workshop and synthetic research addressing the nature of Arctic biodiversity.  The Arctic biotic environment is increasingly characterized in terms of its biodiversity: the range, variety, variability, stability, and interactions of Arctic species and ecoregions.  A complete characterization of Arctic biodiversity is equivalent to a full unerstanding of the specis present, their cyclical and directional changes in distribution and abundance, their interactions, and the structure of the arctic environment.  The workshop is intended to outline the scientific requirments for evaluating the status and trends of biodiversity throughout the Arctic, emphasizing the extend and limitations of current knowledge.  Based on these requirements, the participants will bring together all of the relevant literature and knowledge--scientific and traditionally based--and focused on selected key species and regions.  These will be used subsequently to describe and characterize aspects of the Arctic environment and its systems, while identifying gaps in current knowledge and it application.  The workshop will outline how an understanding of the Arctic environment in terms of its biodiversity can contribute to sound, long-term conservation actions.  Expected outcomes of the workshop include target summaries on the current understanding of Arctic biodivers, case studies of selected species or ecoregions, a summary of current conservation concerns in the Arctic with regard to their implications for biodiversity and how biodiversity illuminate key conservation needs.",
