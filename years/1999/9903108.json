Using single crystal samples, the atomic positions and elemental compositions of the first few atomic layers are measured.  The main characterization method employed is low energy electron diffraction.  The energy of the incident beam is varied and the diffracted beam intensities measured using video imaging and digitization technology.  The desired information is extracted from the data since the structure and composition of the surface determine the variation of the scattered intensity with energy.  All experiments are performed on clean, annealed surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum.  Experiments are performed on the three major low-index faces of the silver-gold alloy crystal.  In this way, the influence of the bulk termination on the composition and structure of the surface can be explored.  The surface composition is not expected to be the same as the bulk composition due to surface segregation; the influence of the metal vacuum interface will alter the composition in the near-surface region.  Likewise, the surface structure is not the same as the simple bulk termination.  Silver-gold alloys are particularly interesting in this respect since the pure gold surface is more prone to reconstruction than the pure silver surface.  Both of these phenomena (surface structure changes and surface composition changes) are greatly affected by the particular crystal face that is exposed.  In this work, the (100), (111), and (110) crystal faces are investigated.\r\n%%%\r\nThe significance of this work is based on the contribution it will make to overall understanding of the properties of alloy surfaces.  The silver-gold system is chosen for its relative simplicity; complicated chemical interactions are not expected since these elements are noble metals and the lattice constants of the two metals are similar.  The similarity of the lattice constants implies that lattice strain effects are minimal.  These characteristics make silver-gold alloys a good model system on which to build a fundamental understanding of alloy surfaces.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
