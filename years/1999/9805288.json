 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Gary Feinman and his collaborators will conduct archaeological research at the site of El Palmillo, located in the Valley of Oaxaca in central Mexico. The goal is to look at a poorly known and understood period in Middle American prehistory known as the `Classic-Postclassic transition.` Across a number of cultures the Classic period witnessed the height of state development and major cities and monumental constructions in both the Mayan lowlands and Mexican highlands date to this time. As the term `Classic` suggests, archaeologists see this time as the high point in Mesoamerican civilization. At the end of the Classic period many large sites were abandoned large scale monumental construction ceased and people dispersed into smaller settlements. For this reason the transition to the Postclassic is often referred to as a `collapse.` In the Valley of Oaxaca this general pattern holds true and the Classic period site of Monte Alban was one of the major centers of power in Mexico. Extensive research has been conducted at Monte Alban but the Postclassic prehistory of the region is poorly known. Dr. Feinman's research will help to remedy this situation.  Dr Feinman notes that although political fragmentation took place in the Oaxaca Postclassic, population growth occurred, economic specialization appeared to have increased and both local and long distance trade flourished. In this region at least, the concept of `collapse` is likely inappropriate. In 1997 Dr. Feinman has located a large site which spans the Classic Postclassic at El Palmillo and with NSF support he will conduct excavations there. In Middle America the local household served most often as the locus for craft production. Dr. Feinman will excavate a series of these to determine the range of manufacturing activities which took place, their intensive and their distribution across households.   This research is important because it will provide insight into a major transition in the history of the development of civilization. It will supplement extensive work in the region and provide data of interest to many archaeologists.",
