 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Desjarlais is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the Molecular Biophysics program to develop and experimentally evaluate the use of computational methods for the design and engineering of proteins.  Algorithms will be developed using a combination of combinatorial optimization methods and atomistic force fields for the evaluation of protein designs.  The proposed experiments will be used to evaluate the effects of designed changes on the properties of proteins such as stability, dynamics, structure, and most importantly, function.  The protein currently under investigation is the cold shock protein B from Bacillus subtilis, chosen for its small size, ease of production, and readily measurable properties.  Desjarlais' teaching plan involves the development of new courses on Biophysical Chemistry and Computational Biology.  The courses will be developed and taught in conjunction with the Penn State University Life Sciences Consortium.\r\n\r\nThe field of protein design has continued to grow since its inception in the 1980's.  The design, production, and biophysical characterization of novel proteins or variants of natural proteins has provided a wealth of insight into the qualities of amino acid sequences required for the folding of proteins into well defined, stable structures.   Recent developments in the combination of computational and experimental methods for protein design has opened up exciting opportunities for the future of protein design and engineering.  This promise may ultimately lead to the design of novel proteins or modification of the properties of existing proteins, such as increased thermal or chemical stability.  Success in these efforts will also create new avenues for the design of nanotechnological devices and molecules with therapeutic or industrial value.",
