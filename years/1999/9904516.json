Related techniques, such as electronic absorption and infrared spectroscopy, will also be utilized, and theoretical models that account for the experimental FCS measurements will be developed. FCS signals, induced by rapid photoinduced biochemical reactions, will be  used to  extract key parameters that quantitatively model the  level crossing dynamics describing the  reaction.   Variations of external conditions such as  temperature, viscosity, and magnetic field  will be  used to probe the effects of protein relaxation and spin-state selection rules on the reaction dynamics.  Use of site directed mutants and chromophore replacements will probe the effect of protein amino acids and chromophore peripheral substituents on the FCS signals.  Quantitative studies and comparisons of field and reaction driven coherent motions will be carried out using variations in laser pulse shape, optical carrier frequency,  and monochromator detection frequency.  Measurements of the  relative phases of the oscillatory signals will be used to test for the presence of intermediate spin-states  on the Fe-L dissociation  pathway.  Heme-ligand binding and dissociation reactions involving  NO, CO and O2 will be compared. Further experimental and theoretical studies involving the dynamic effects of protein distributions and conformational interconversions  will be carried out. Laser mediated  thermal perturbations will be followed using pump induced changes of the Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering.  \r\n\r\nOverall the project's objectives are to achieve a better understanding of  the optical properties  of biological molecules, both in and out of  equilibrium, and to apply this knowledge to elucidate  their mechanism of action. These studies are significant not  only in their relationship  to the biological sciences, but also in their connection to the understanding of basic light-matter interaction associated with complex systems in the condensed phase. This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Divisions of Physics and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
