These type of materials are excellent candidates to replace steel reinforcing bars and prestressing tendons in MRI applications, marein environments, and many ofther civilian and military infrastructure uses. These materials show great promise because they are non-metallic and therefore are believed to be generally free of the corrosive problems to which steel has been suseptible. The objectives of the reserch involve additional innovative short-term laboratory tests that allow accurate, reliable prediction of long-term performance of FRP materials. FRP reinforcing bars constructed using long-fiber glass strands embedded in a vinyl ester matrix will be examined. This research will examine the fundamental nature of the deterioration and damage proceses in FRP materials when exposed to concrete environments and moisture absorption desorption cycles which will be used to look at innovative ways to model the behaviro of these processes and accurately predict the long-term behavior by accelerated aging techniques. Steps involve in studying the long-term durability of FRP reinforcement in concrete include characterizing the nature of concrete porewater and comparing this added model to previously  developed models. The scope of this investigation involves studying the effects of FRP reinforcing bars exposed to common environmental conditions within concrete. This involves the test and analysis of FRP reinforcing bars, including control specimens. The scope includes subjecting specimens to stress under assumed aging conditions as well as unstressed specimens. Following subjection to the aging process, specimens will be failed in tension and flexure to determine the loss in strength due to the environmental conditions.\r\n\r\n",
