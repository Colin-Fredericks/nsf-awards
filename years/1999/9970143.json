Knowledge of the molecular basis of life has grown considerably more detailed since the inception of electron microcopy for the examination of ultrathin sections of resin embedded tissues.   The need to be able to examine particular molecules at subcellular sites has driven the development of a means to make ultrathin sections of frozen cells and tissues.  Such cryosections can be labeled robustly with antibodies and other molecules such as fusion proteins and derivitized RNAs, and immunogold to localize these molecules to regions of specialized cellular activity.  City of Hope investigators have vigorous programs that can take advantage of this type of information in their studies of cell function.  Projects include studies of synaptic transmission; CD44a and its role in a morphogenetic model; the fate of products of transgenes such as Bcl-XL and mdr1; the fate of the major histocompatibility complex encoded B-G molecules in virally-infected cells; and localization of p53.  The equipment being acquired will make possible the quantitative analysis of cellular localization and co-localization in these and other projects at the City of Hope using a combination of ultrathin cryosections and immunogold labeling.",
