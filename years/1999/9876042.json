It involves the fundamental measurement on an atomic scale of frictional forces present at the surface of atomically clean metals and conducting oxides.  The studies will entail measurements of friction for single asperity contacts under conditions in which the chemical, phonon, and electron structure of the interface is well understood. The work will establish the conditions under which frictional energy can be dissipated through the excitation of electrons of the contacting bodies.\r\n\t\r\nThe educational activities involve the development of an undergraduate introductory chemistry curriculum designed specifically for engineering students. Both lecture and laboratory resources will be developed which focus on an atomic or molecular view of materials and their relation to physical properties. The objective of this effort is to meet the currently changing curriculum needs of the chemistry and engineering programs at the introductory college level.\r\n***\r\n",
