 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation, provides support for a special conference, sponsored jointly with NASA, on building and deploying autonomous systems in extreme environments. Autonomous Systems are defined as permanent geophysical or astrophysical installations that are self-sustaining over periods of months and years. They acquire data on a regular time interval or upon a triggering event and either store that data or transmit it to a data center. Many investigators conduct research in polar, sea floor, or other extreme environments that require autonomous systems. Because of the burgeoning scientific potential for such systems, the present is a good time to bring the community together during a workshop in order to discuss the special challenges associated with developing these systems for extreme environments so that past mistakes can be minimized and past successes can be built upon toward better scientific output. The conference venue will be the Von Karman Auditorium at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the tentative conference dates are August 31- September 2, 1999. The goals of the workshop are to promote dialogue on autonomous system design, make recommendations on power, thermal, data, communications, and packaging systems, and to decide on standardization for future systems. The workshop will also include discussion of, and possible recommendation of, testing criteria that should be met before systems could deployed in extreme environments.\r\n\r\n",
