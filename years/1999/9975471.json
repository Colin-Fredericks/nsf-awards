 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made to Polytechnic University in support of the research of Prof. Mark M. Green by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the Polymer Program in the Division of Materials Research. The objective of the research is to develop stereochemical approaches for elucidating the nature of polymers and the materials states they form. The material states investigated will be single polymer chains in solution, lyotrophic liquid crystals from concentrated solutions, thermally reversible gels, and the amorphous glassy state. Single chain studies will show how polymers amplify chirality.  Liquid crystal studies will probe the mechanism of how nematic states are converted to cholesteric states. Studies with thermally reversible gels will define the responsible aggregate states unique to stiff chains and how to predict and control polymer properties. In all cases, chiral pendant groups attached to the polymers will be used as probes to influence and modify polymer properties.\r\n\r\nThe study of the role of chirality on polymer properties will have both fundamental and technological impact. Chiral amplification in polymers can provide a basis for optical switching, how conversion of liquid crystals between the nematic and twisted nematic states relates to LC display devices, and how the effect of temperature on polymer chirality can be used to optically measure temperature. More broadly, chiral amplification may provide clues to the relationship between circularly polarized light in outer space and the origin of optical activity on earth.\r\n",
