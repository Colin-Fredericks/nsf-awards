 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nSES 99-06044 - Margaret Jacob (UCLA)\r\n\"Scientific Culture and the Making of the Industrial West:  Part Two\"\r\n\r\nThe approach presented in Part II of the study of scientific culture and its role in industrialization expands significantly upon the models and insights, as well as it advances the chronology, laid out in Scientific Culture and the Making of the Industrial West (Oxford UP, 1997). That book explored the period before 1800, before the term \"industrial revolution\" became part of common speech. It examined situations throughout northern and western Europe where the goal was profit and actors were either unaware, or dimly aware, of their participation in what would be seen in retrospect as a movement with enormous historical implications. By 1800 that naivete had largely disappeared; this project covers the period from 1800 to 1830.\r\n\r\nBy the first decade of the nineteenth century state bureaucracies throughout Western Europe had become deeply concerned about the British lead in industry and the need to compete. In their concern the French revolutionaries led the way. Astute observers believed that having a population educated toward industrial activity and accepting of its consequences, made for profit and national wealth. Did some regions of northern and western Europe instill that message more effectively than others? If so, why did they? Can their efforts be tied to achieving earlier, rather than later, advances in industrial activity of a mechanical sort? How did the educational systems of the period from 1800 to the 1 830s change under the impact of a growing awareness of industrial development? How and when does curricular content, both scientific and ideological, change in the period? A set of related questions inform the first set of questions: How do would-be entrepreneurs perceive what they must know and value in order to succeed? Are there national differences, even between the Dutch and the Belgians -- particularly before and then after 1830 when The Netherlands and Belgium are once again separated -- as to how to approach economic development? Do differences in religion matter, particularly in the Low Countries where Catholics and Protestants are so closely interspersed, or in France where tensions between Catholic educators and secularists were endemic to the period from 1800 to the reforms of the 1830s and beyond? We do not have a detailed and comparative picture of the science and mathematics being taught in the daily curricula of primary and secondary schools in English, Dutch/Flemish and French-speaking Europe. Case studies of clerical and non-clerical schools, colleges and academies in all four countries are proposed as one key element - but by no means the only element - in the research here proposed. Attention also needs to be paid to the inculcation of ideologies about time, work and social prestige as instilled by textbooks and teachers. We need to know more about the informal sources of industrial education, for workers and employers, and especially about the role of women in that process. In particular voluntary associations in all four countries need to be examined. For example, in Middleburg in The Netherlands the PI has discovered the records of a scientific society for women that met for more than 100 years beginning in 1785. One goal of one year of the project will be the production of a monograph about the first women's scientific society in the West. Throughout the three-year project comparative questions will dominate the research agenda. Did markedly industrial areas like Birmingham, Lille, or Liege put in place a different set of informal societies and formal educational practices from what can be seen in markedly under-industrialized areas like East Anglia, or Maastricht, or the region around Cahors? Can differences in curricula be found between Flemish and French-speaking areas of Belgium? Are cultural factors at work in creating the disparity in wealth evident by 1830 between various geographic and linguistic regions?\r\n\r\n",
