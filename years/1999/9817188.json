This study focuses on a natural four-chain\r\ncoiled coil model motif from Lac repressor to quantitate sequence-structure\r\nrelationships in a systematic fashion.  A mutational approach is used to\r\nstudy the effects of different amino acid sidechains at specific positions\r\nin the Lac repressor coiled coil.  Experimental strategies involve\r\nsynthesis of peptides by solid-phase synthetic methods, purification by\r\nreversed-phase chromatography, and biophysical characterization.  Coiled\r\ncoil stability is measured by the oligomeric states during temperature or\r\nchemical denaturation, peptide concentration titrations using circular\r\ndichroism spectropolarimetry and   analytical ultracentrifugation.  Using\r\nsuch approaches, a series of experiments will systematically explore the\r\nrelationship between coiled coil stability and several defining\r\ncharacteristics of coiled coils. Sequences chosen for study will test the\r\nrelationship between helix length and stability, the role of hydrophobic\r\namino acids on stability and oligomerization, the importance of side-chain\r\ninteractions at other heptad positions on tetramer stability, and the\r\nability to design simplified sequences based on rules so learned.\r\n\r\nWith an understanding of the determinants that define coiled coil\r\nstructure, it will be possible to design novel structures that may be of\r\nuse in nano-engineering, particularly for the synthesis of long\r\n\"nanoropes\", and with appropriate modifications, may even be converted into\r\nconducting materials such as \"nanowires.\"  This project is well-suited for\r\nan undergraduate laboratory since the synthesis and characterization of\r\neach peptide described herein is a project unto itself and can be\r\naccomplished easily within the constraints of a one-year senior research\r\nproject. Important skills that will be learned by undergraduate students\r\ninclude rigorous quantitative methods in protein biochemistry using\r\nbiophysical methods and cross-cutting interdisciplinary methods that span\r\nfrom biology and chemistry to physics and mathematics.\r\n\r\n",
