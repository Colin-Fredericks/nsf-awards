 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for research on how to use haptic interfaces (which provide force-feedback and the sense of touch) as a possible alternative to the traditional purely visual interface for simulating assembly and disassembly operations on a computer.  Specifically, the  research seeks to answer the question whether a haptically enabled assembly and disassembly simulation environment that allows the user to literally feel the objects in the virtual computer world provides a significant improvement over purely visual simulation feedback in assembly and disassembly simulations.   A haptically enabled assembly and disassembly simulation environment will be developed and compared with a number of different available assembly and disassembly simulation environments that provide only visual feedback.  Case studies with different levels of visual and tactile complexity will be employed.\r\n\r\nThis award will provide for a direct understanding of the utility of using haptic interfaces compared to purely visual feedback in assembly and disassembly simulations.  Part of the results will be a haptically enabled assembly and disassembly simulation environment that can be used for benchmarking and educational purposes.  The research will provide a clear understanding of the advantages as well as limitations of haptic technology in this area, as well as the potential of applying this technology in industrial settings.",
