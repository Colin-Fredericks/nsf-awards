The spilt coil configuration is required in order obtain magnetic fields at rotated at different orientations relative to the experimental probe.  A range of projects will benefit significantly from\r\nthe acquisition of  this instrument.  These projects, which will impact the research efforts of several groups at Montana State University, , include: i) thermodynamic studies of the unconventional (non-Fermi liquid) conducting states in quasi-one dimensional molecular conductors; ii) electronic specific heat of bulk quantum Hall systems; iii) thermodynamic investigations of magnetic relaxation processes in nano-scale magnetic clusters and molecules; iv) critical phenomena in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic perovskites; and v) the soliton contribution to the magnetic specific heat in two-dimensional magnets.  All of the materials of interest are highly anisotropic and, therefore, necessitate studies for different magnetic field orientations.  In addition, the magnet will be used in combination with other techniques for which the experimental probe cannot conveniently be rotated within a conventional axial magnet, for instance, electron paramagnetic resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, dielectric and microwave conductivity measurements.\r\n\r\nMajor Research Instrumentation funding is being used to obtain instrumentation that will be used to study a variety of materials that exhibit low-dimensionality.  The instrument will have a great impact on the research infrastructure at the university as it will impact research projects from investigators from several departments at the university as well as from other institutions.  This instrumentation will have a large impact on student learning, as it will be used to demonstrate magnetic phenomena at the K-12 level as well as being used by undergraduate through post-doctoral students for research projects.\r\n\r\n",
