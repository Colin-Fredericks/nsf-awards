 "awd_abstract_narration": "9978561\r\nZvanut\r\n\r\nFor switching technology involving metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices,  SiC is a promising candidate to replace  Si because it may be thermally oxidized to form the insulating SiO2 layer, and it lattice matches well with an alternative insulator, A1N.  Most SiC studies show that devices built on the C-face (000-1) are inferior to those produced on the Siface (0001), but there are few investigations that address methods of improving the C-face. The PI's will conduct electrical measurements on MOS capacitors formed from the C-face and Siface of SiC, and they will investigate a variety of oxidation and post-oxidation treatments to look into the possibility of improving C-face MOS devices.  Recognizing the tendency for the C-face to graphitize more readily than the Si-face will provide a starting point in their search to find conditions which optimize the structural and electrical quality of carbon-face devices.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work has potential for advancing high power device technology in several ways.  Ultimately, the work should produce a recipe for making C-face MOS structures free from the difficulties which plague Si-face structures.  In the process, the PI's likely could improve Si-face devices; thus, they open the way to a variety of SiC-based MOS devices utilizing both the Si- and C-faces.  On a more fundamental level, the systematic series of controlled experiments proposed should reveal a better understanding of the differences between the two faces.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
