 "awd_abstract_narration": "Singular integral operators is a vast modern branch of Analysis, which\r\nnow attracts many strong analysts.  Particularly intense development\r\nfor the last several years has been in the field of averaging\r\noperators and Fourier integral operators associated to singular\r\ncanonical relations. Andrew Comech obtained several general results in\r\nthis field; in particular, the classification of singular canonical\r\nrelations and regularity properties of the associated Fourier integral\r\noperators in the Sobolev spaces.  The approach was based on\r\nincorporating certain curvature assumptions into the modern tools of\r\nHarmonic Analysis.  Among the applications of these results are the\r\nregularity properties of the Radon Transform of Melrose-Taylor and\r\nsmoothness of restrictions of solutions to hyperbolic equations.  In\r\nboth cases Andrew's methods lead to the optimal conclusions.  The\r\nfuture research is aimed at the properties of solutions to non-linear\r\nhyperbolic equations, such as long-time behavior and soliton\r\nasymptotics of solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic equations.  Questions\r\nfrom the very foundations of Harmonic Analysis, which are related to\r\nthe proposed research, include the regularity properties of the\r\naverages taken over lower-dimensional varieties (most importantly,\r\naveraging operators over curves).  \r\n\r\nAndrew Comech is going to continue his research on the wedge of the\r\ntwo fundamental mathematical fields: Harmonic Analysis and the Theory\r\nof Hyperbolic Equations.  The research grows far into the modern\r\ndevelopment of the mathematics, being intimately related to nonlinear \r\ndifferential equations, attractors, and solitons.  On the other hand, \r\nthe research has its roots deep in the natural sciences and technology. \r\nParticular interests of Andrew Comech are related to the properties of \r\nnonlinear wave equations of relativistic Quantum Physics, which are \r\nnow widely investigated both in Physics and in Mathematics.  Not less \r\ninteresting are the opportunities open due to applications to Tomography, \r\nas well as aspects of numerical computations involving Fourier Analysis.  \r\nThese are active and promising areas of today's scientific research.  \r\n",
