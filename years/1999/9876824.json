 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, the distribution and use of biological data has assumed a position of great importance.  More than ever scientists are required to draw upon autonomous and disparate sources of data to address biological questions that fall under the umbrella of systematics and ecology. Two of the limiting factors affecting the scientist's ability to use such data are the electronic availability and format accessibility of the requisite data.  The Oregon State University Herbarium (OSC)is actively involved in developing databases that address these issues with respect to the OSC's holdings.  The short-term goal at OSC is to have the entire mycological collection electronically databased in a format that is easily integrated with other databases and accessible via the World Wide Web (WWW).\r\n\r\nThis project will computerize the biological information associated with approximately 60,000 fungal specimens housed in the OSC mycological collection.  The computerization of the collection will allow all interested users access  to the collection's holdings which includes numerous invaluable collections (e.g. world's most comprehensive collection of truffles and false-truffles, types of VAM fungi from around the world as well as removal ascomycetes and lichens).  OSU has long been recognized as a center for the study of systematics and ecology of fungi.  The vast majority of voucher specimens from eight decades of mycological research at OSU are housed at OSC and computerization of the collection will make this information more readily available to fungal ecologists and systematists around the world.  Also, OSC holds a large collection of vouchered, recent specimens from the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest/LTER.  Computerization of this data will allow ecologists and other researchers at HJA and throughout the LTER network access to critical biological information regarding the organisms responsible for much of nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.",
