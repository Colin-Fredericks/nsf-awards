 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the critical need of better equipping the emerging engineering technologists with technical skills that are current with the recent advances in industrial power electronics and machine drives. This in turn is expected to help close competency gaps in both technical and communication areas. \r\n\t\r\nThe multimedia team of the NSF-supported Greenfield Coalition (NSF-GC), working with this PI, developed several visualization and simulation examples as part of a project in electric machines for a manufacturing curriculum. This project enhances several of these multimedia components and adapts them into the 'Electric Machines and Power', a senior-level core course at the Division of Engineering Technology (DET) at Wayne State University (WSU). \r\n\r\nDrive experiments, instead of mere characterization studies on individual machines, are to provide industry-relevant hands-on experience. Finite element based visualizations are to enable observation of fundamental phenomena that cause machine functionalities.  Flux distributions due to differing geometry and material can be observed. Pspice/Saber-based interactive simulation types of animation examples are to be developed further in order to enable concept clarity and observation of aftermath of motor faults. Authorware/Flash animation examples are targeted towards better student understanding of concepts such as slip and power factor correction. Equipping the traditional offering of this course with these multimedia components implemented is expected to impart better student learning.\r\n \r\nThe impact of the project on the educational community is very significant.  All electrical, electromechanical, and manufacturing technology students at WSU-DET will benefit from this project. Several of the components are to be used during Detroit area K-12 student visits during Engineer's day, K-C-P program and Open house. Dissemination includes publications and demonstrations at conferences. The provision of the developed material on the division's web page is expected to trigger interest from and use by other engineering institutions.\r\n",
