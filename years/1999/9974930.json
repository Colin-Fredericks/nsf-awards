 "awd_abstract_narration": "The systems for non-self recognition in invertebrate internal defense systems remain poorly understood.  Invertebrates rely exclusively on innate or non-adaptive immunity.  They lack the ability to  rearrange immunoglobulin superfamily genes to generate the specific immunoglobulins and antigen-receptors which typify the acquired immune systems of jawed vertebrates.  Rather, invertebrates employ carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) which recognize the carbohydrates displayed by many of their pathogens.  Despite recent progress, few invertebrate recognition factors have been characterized.  This project is based on preliminary experiments in which a novel category of non-self recognition factors have been found in a mollusc.  The M line strain of Biomphalaria glabrata (Gastropoda, Planorbidae) when exposed  to a parasite (Echinostoma paraensei) responds by producing a family of 65kDa lectins that bind both the parasite and its soluble antigens.  These lectins comprise a novel combination of variable (V)-type immunoglobulin domains and fibrinogen-related domains. These lectins have been named fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs).  Both the individual fibrinogen-like and V-type  immunoglobulin domains vary among the multiple FREP genes.  Currently, B. glabrata is the only invertebrate known to employ V-type immunoglobulin domains within the structure of a defense-related protein.  However, molecular data indicate that FREP genes are found in other planorbid snails.  The discovery of FREPs raises several research questions.  This project will address the functional role of FREPs in the immune system of B. glabrata.  Functional aspects that will be studied include (1) binding of FREPS to parasites and hemocytes, (2) tissue sites of FREP production, and (3) FREP involvement in the encapsulation of parasites by hemocytes.  The project will also examine the genetic diversity of FREPs among different molluscan species.  The fibrinogen-related and V-type immunoglobulin domain sequences will be compared to other members of these gene families to investigate the evolutionary relationships of the individual domains.  This study will provide knowledge regarding the functional role of FREPs in the internal defense system of molluscs and the relationship of FREPS to the evolution of immune systems in other animals.\r\n",
