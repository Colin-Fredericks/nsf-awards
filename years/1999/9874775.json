 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is the thorough understanding of \r\nfundamental phenomena in dynamic fracture of homogeneous and bimaterial systems \r\nsubjected to high shearing loads. Recent experimental evidence during shear \r\ndominated crack propagation along interfaces, has shown the development of \r\nsupersonic crack speeds and crack face contact. In addition, theoretical \r\nevidence predicts supersonic speeds even in homogeneous materials, under high \r\nshear loading, if the homogeneous material exhibits a cohesive type failure \r\nresponse. Here, experimental and numerical analysis will be conducted to \r\nscrutinize the physical details of the contact zone and of limiting crack speeds\r\nin bimaterial interface and homogeneous material systems. Special emphasis will \r\nbe placed on the issue of crack face friction and subsequent heating during \r\ncontact. The educational part of this proposal describes a plan for improvement \r\nof teaching practices in current courses and enhanced undergraduate \r\nlaboratories, including animated classroom presentations as well as physical \r\ndemonstrations of counter-intuitive dynamical systems.\r\n\r\n",
