 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Brian Laird is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research on the simulation and theory of crystal-melt interfaces.  Laird's prior work in this area has been focused on the solid-liquid interface for idealized hard sphere systems.  The proposed continuation will extend this work to more realistic systems such as metals and metal alloys and to systems with orientationally dependent interactions.  Density-functional theory in conjunction with formal statistical mechanics will be used to: 1) calculate the interfacial free energy; 2) predict the solute segregation at the interface for mixtures such as metal alloys; and 3) predict the structure and dynamics for solid-liquid interfaces of molecular systems.  Since there is a significant lack of experimental data in this area of research, the simulations will provide \"experimental\" data with which to evaluate and develop analytical theories for such systems.\r\n\r\nIn order to fully understand such technologically important phenomena as crystal growth, homogeneous nucleation, equilibrium crystal shapes or equilibrium solute segregation, it is necessary to have detailed information on the microscopic properties of the interface between a crystal an its melt.  Unfortunately, there is nearly a total lack of experimental data on such systems making these studies difficult.  Thus, computational methods such as the computer simulation techniques proposed by Laird go far beyond their usual roles in the interpretation of experimental data and become important data upon which to base analytical theories for these important processes.",
