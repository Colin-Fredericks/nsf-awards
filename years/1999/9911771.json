It will bring 35 teachers (five from each district) for a three-week summer workshop for intensive content, pedagogical and leadership training.  The workshop will increase the teachers' knowledge of the atmospheric sciences and mathematics, enable them to develop activity-based teaching strategies, show them how to use current educational technologies, increase their leadership skills and provide them with laboratory and field experiences as they work with UCAR scientists.  During the school year these teams of lead teachers will work with 21 teachers in their district (for a total of 182), aided by UCAR scientists, instructors from Colorado's Science Discovery Program and the Annenberg/CPB Internet training program.  The atmospheric science curriculum will be based upon the materials developed by the original Project  LEARN  program and includes modules entitled \"Atmospheric Dynamics,\" \"Ozone in Our Atmosphere\" and \"Cycles of the Earth and Atmosphere.\"\r\n",
