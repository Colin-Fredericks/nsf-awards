This work is of interest to a widespread condensed matter community studying the roles of disorder, correlations, and dimensionality in quantum transport phenomena.  The project is focused on two areas. The first is parallel magnetic field studies of thin film superconductors where coupling of the magnetic field to the electronic spins drives the system into the normal state via a first-order phase transition.  Associated with this transition are some novel and as of yet poorly understood non-equilibrium behavior such as avalanches, state memory and reentrance.  The goal of this part of the project is to more fully investigate the roles of disorder and dimensionality on the non-equilibrium behavior and to look for possible applications of the state memory effect.  The second area of study involves magneto-transport and density of states measurements of very high resistance metal films.  The ultimate goal is to make the first measurements of the Coulomb gap (Efros-Shklovskii gap) in a 2D system and then correlate the gap behavior with the observed magneto-transport behavior in the insulating phase.  Ultra-thin, homogeneously disordered Be films will be used for these studies.  These projects afford excellent opportunities for training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-docs.  This research, in fact, bridges a gap between esoteric quantum physics and more technologically oriented material science.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research project investigates the electronic properties of ultra-thin, low atomic mass, metal films and wires in extreme environments.  Since the project involves both the fabrication of samples and measurements on those samples, it offers unusually broad educational and research opportunities for students and post-docs. Two projects will be pursued: One involves the behavior of thin film superconductivity in very high parallel (to the film surface) magnetic fields. This transition is fundamentally quantum in nature and displays unusual quasi-static non-equilibrium behavior such as avalanches and memory effects.  The microscopic origin of these effects is still not understood but is expected to impact the general field of quantum phase transitions. The other concerns the role of electron-electron interactions in the electron transport properties of very high resistance Be films. It is believed that the non-granular character of the Be films will allow progress to be made on this very important problem that is now known to be relevant to a wide variety of condensed matter problems.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
