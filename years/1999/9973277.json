She will participate in a research project which involves the constitutive and fracture characterization of quasibrittle materials subjected to a variety of leading rates.  Several constitutive and numerical issues will be addressed, including the effect of rate, decohesion,plastic-damage and fragmentation. Constitutive characterization will consist of the development and calibration of a rate dependent constitutive model in the context of damage-plasticity and viscoplasticity.  The model should be capable of representng quasibrittle material behavior over a broad range of rates, from quasistatic to dynmaic, permitting a calculation of damping.  Fracture characterization will be studied based on the use of cohesive interface finite elements.  Crack initiation, slow and dynamic growth data and arrest measurements on marble specimens will be used for the appropriate choice of cohesive traction laws describing the decohesion process.",
