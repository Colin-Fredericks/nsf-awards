 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sometimes, restricting the domain of interest makes a hard problem easy.  For example, one can find the minimum vertex cover of a bipartite graph in polynomial time even though the general problem is NP-hard.  Sometimes, restricting the domain does not make a problem easier.  For example, finding the minimum vertex cover of a planar graph is NP-hard.  \r\n     This project is to study issues relating to problems whose instances come from classes obtained by natural restrictions on more general classes.  Many subtleties which arise naturally in dealing with such problems have been glossed over in the literature.  Perhaps the most common interpretation of solving a problem on a retricted class is the \"promise\" version, in which there is a guarantee that the input is in the class, and an algorithm to \"solve\" the problem need not function correctly (or even terminate) if this guarantee is not met.  This research is based on different definition, one in which the algorithm must produce correct output even if the input is not in the restricted class; such output may either be \"the input is not in the class\" or the correct solution to the problem. \r\n     The new definition of solving proglems on restricted domains requires algorithms to be \"robust: in the face of invalid input, a more stringent requirement than \"don't care.\"  Robust algorithms are amenable to manipulation as building blocks of more general algorithms; in contrast, \"promise\" algorithms are not.  Furthermore, there exist problems which are in P in the \"promise\" version of solving a problem, while being NP-hard under the new definition.  Arguments can be made that the hardness results are sometimes more meaningful, necessitating a revamping of the notion of restricted class NP-completeness.\r\n     Graph classes provide interesting and natural restricted domains; the project will also study many problems on graph classes which satisfy the twin requirements of being:\r\n\r\n.  Easy to solve given a special and natural representation of a graph (i.e., a \"model\")\r\n\r\n.  Open with respect to complexity if the graph is given in a general form such as an adjacency list.\r\n\r\nWhile some of these open problems appear to be quite hard, they are not easily classifiable as \"really\" being hard.  This is because the model provides a certificate for the problem to be in NP and in co-NP; consequently, such problems can be NP-hard only if NP = co-NP.  An operational notion of intractability is needed for several such problems and the project will investigate possibilities\r\n",
