 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to study, using theoretical analysis and laboratory experiments, the interaction between two issues in voting and information aggregation in environments of incomplete information. The first issue is strategic participation by voters. The second is the partitioning of voters into jurisdictions. In particular, we are interested in the positive and normative implications of alternative electoral partitions when voters have an incentive to behave strategically.\r\n\r\nBuilding on earlier theoretical research on voting we develop model of electoral participation under two information structures, common values and private values. This approach connects our work with the literature on competitive bidding and auctions. In our model, voters behave strategically and respond to informational environments, costs of voting, and the jurisdictional structure. Such dependency allows the investigation of the positive and normative aspects of alternative partitions of the electorate into different jurisdictional structures. This provides an analytical framework for ranking jurisdictional structures based on the underlying informational environment. A simple model is presented for motivational and illustrative purpose.\r\n\r\nAll theoretical predictions will be tested with experiments; a sketch of the design and treatments is provided. Naturally, for any normative conclusions regarding electoral systems to be valid, the predicted behavior leading to these conclusions must mirror real behavior. Of particular interest is how experimental subjects respond to different incentives. For example, parameterizing the direct costs of voting and the informational factors referred to above and varying their values across experimental treatments will allow inferences about the strengths of these factors relative to those that are predicted. The performance of different jurisdictional structures within the same environment can also be observed directly in the experimental data collected.\r\n\r\nThe desired impact of this project includes an improved perspective on the factors influencing voter participation, and scientifically corroborated prescriptions for what kinds of issues should be resolved at a highly centralized level of authority and what kinds at a localized level. As the federal government turns welfare policy over to the states and debates national school curriculum standards, this topic is of particular significance to current United States political economy.\r\n\r\n",
