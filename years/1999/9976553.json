 "awd_abstract_narration": "The idea that environmental quality management can be more efficiently accomplished through the use of pollution permit trading systems is not new. However, the implementation of such systems is new. The design of pollution permits being exchanged and the market in which the permits are traded requires the integration of environmental economics, game theory, operations research and experimental testing. To date only a few major attempts at trading pollution rights have been implemented; for example, lead reduction in gasolines, Emissions Trading Program (ERC), S02 emissions trading, and the Southern California's Regional Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) program. In general, the trading volume in these emissions trading programs have been significantly below the predictions made at the beginning of these programs. At least two studies have pointed out that the market design has been a factor in the low volume of trade in these markets.\r\n\r\n     This proposal is intended to examine variations in institutional trading rules in pollution permit environments. There are specific difficulties in the trading of pollution permits which need attention. Due to temporal persistence and spatial dispersion non-trivial external effects result from trading in one market on adjacent markets. Wind and water flows constrain how permits should be traded, as do local ambient standards. Permits are also often required to be purchased in packages; for example, a firm might need to acquire permits over a five-year period to plan production. Also, the markets currently being used are not designed to handle 'thinly' traded assets.\r\n\r\n     A series of laboratory controlled experiments will employ cash motivated human subjects to trade pollution permits, under realistic economic and environmental constraints. These agents will be highly trained in multiple experiments to ensure their competence and to allow them to develop any strategic behavior that might exploit weaknesses in market design. Institutional variations will include computer assisted combinatorial auctions.\r\n",
