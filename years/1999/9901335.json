The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Ross H. Nehm with support for twelve months to work with Dr. Peter Jung at the Naturhistorisches Museum in Basel, Switzerland.\r\nTheir project will be a comparative study of speciation and extinction in an abundant and richly preserved group of Neogene gastropods from the Limon Basin and Bocas del Toro Basin on the Caribbean coast of Central America through closure of the Panamanian Isthmus and the Plio-Pleistocene mass extinction.  Their goal is to investigate the processes that generate biodiversity during episodes of major geological and faunal change.  This project will work within the context of the Panama Paleontology Project (PPP), which is a large-scale multidisciplinary research program that has been investigating the geological and paleobiological changes in the Neogene of Tropical America for over a decade.  The PPP has laid the foundation for exploring the links between the rate and scale of geological and evolutionary change.\r\nThe Naturhistorisches Museum is the center of Panama Paleontology Project (PPP) mollusk research and contains the fossil material from the extensive geological surveys of the Caribbean coast of tropical America necessary for this research.  Dr. Jung is a member of the PPP who is actively involved in research on the evolution and extinction of the Caribbean mollusk fauna in tropical America.\r\n***\r\n",
