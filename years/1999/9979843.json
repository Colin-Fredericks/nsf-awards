 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns the investigation of  whether teacher training in triarchic (analytic, creative, practical) teaching results in improved student performance in grades 1-4. The study will involve rural, suburban, and urban schools drawing populations from low, medium, and high socioeconomic levels. For each of the 6 settings there will be 3 experimental and 6 control schools.  There will be at least 216 teachers involved in the study with an expectation that up to 324 teachers will participate. \r\n\r\nAll conditions will cover the same basic skills. The duration of the intervention will be the same for each condition. The conditions will differ in the methods teachers are given for teaching skills. These are triarchic instruction (experimental), critical thinking or analytic instruction (control), and convention (memory based) instruction (control). The success of the intervention will be measured using multiple dependent variables including conventional evaluations by teachers and students, performance evaluations of teachers and students, and affective evaluations of teachers and students. It will be possible to compare gain scores in the experimental versus the control groups as will as in the two control groups compared to one another. The instructional intervention is in teacher training which will be for 40 hours (5 working days) and 10 hours of inservice instruction and monitoring of their implementation of learned materials.\r\n",
