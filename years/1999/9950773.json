The project will produce a Communication Training Handbook supported by Video Modules. These products will also be available in shortened form on a website and as downloadable files.\r\n\r\nThe communication program, known as CONNECT, consists of a series of intensive, experiential workshops that deal with fundamental issues and then transitions into a menu of advanced topics and professional engineering scenarios. The workshops are complemented by a series of seminars in graphical communications and workplace, entrepreneurial or international issues. The program has been in development since 1994 and was expanded to the whole engineering school in 1997.  It is administered by the engineering school and linked to specific courses, thereby, integrating it into the curriculum.",
