 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe goals of our proposed project are to develop meshfree-particle methods, which provide: \r\n\r\n1. multiple length and time scales capabilities; \r\n2. the abilities to treat shear failure bands, damage evolution, fracture, crack growth, fragmentation, and large deformation problems; \r\n3. the capability to establish simulation-based acquisition, dramatically reducing the amount of live-fire testing, which is expensive and time consuming; and \r\n\r\nTo this end, the following objectives will serve as milestones as well as assist in the accomplishment of the above stated results: \r\n\r\n1.   The development of an adaptive micro-macro material length scale bridging methodology based on wavelet multiresolution analysis of shear bands so that refinement can be introduced in areas of high gradients; and \r\n2.   Collaboration with DOE and DOD personnel for validation and refinement of the procedures by comparison with experimental results. \r\n\r\n",
