 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation's Innovation and Organizational Change Program, this study examines whether the implementation of \"high performance\" workplace practices ensure better firm performance.   It is based on the Educational Quality of the Workforce National Employers Survey (EQW-NES), a new database from a nationally representative sample of businesses from 1993-1996 that provides cross section and longitudinal information on workplace practices such as total quality management systems, benchmarking, reengineering, the diffusion of computer usage among non-managerial employees, recruiting strategies, the use of profit sharing and the extent of employee participation in decision making. Combined with wage and human capital information on employees, the study matches data from the survey with other characteristics of the business such as its age, its exporting activities, whether or not it is unionized, employee turnover, the age of the capital stock, gender and race composition of the workforce, and the capital intensity and performance of the business.\r\n\r\nThe study looks at the impact on labor productivity of worker characteristics (gender, race and turnover), educational background of the workforce and hiring and training practices.  These are analyzed along with establishment characteristics (age of capital stock and technology) and innovations in workplace practices such as profit sharing, teamwork, employee involvement in decision making. \r\n\r\nThe findings will increase our understanding of the impacts of high performance workplace practices on better firm performance and of the educational characteristics of the workforce that underlie high performance.\r\n",
