 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Arabidopsis, two floral homeotic genes, APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI), are required for the formation of petals and stamens.  AP3 and PI are both expressed in petal and stamen primordia, consistent with their proposed organ identity roles.  AP3 and PI both encode MADS-box proteins; the MADS-box is required for DNA binding and has been found in a number of other yeast and mammalian transcription factors.  AP3 and PI bind to DNA as an obligate heterodimer, and several lines of evidence suggest that the specificity of AP3/PI action may depend on interactions with other cofactors as well as on protein modification.  This proposal aims to investigate how the action of the AP3 and PI proteins is regulated.  A modified one-hybrid screen is proposed to identify cofactors that interact with AP3 and PI to modulate their biological specificity.  Since both AP3 and PI contain a conserved potential phosphorylation site, it is possible that protein modification may also play a role in modulating AP3/PI action.  Immunoprecipitation experiments and transgenic studies will be used to ascertain whether the phosphorylation status of AP3 and/or PI plays a role in modifying their function.  Finally, AP3 and PI may act in a non-cell autonomous fashion, indicating that these gene products may play a role in intercellular signaling.  Plants mosaic for AP3 (or PI) will be generated using a modified Ac/Ds system.  Mosaic patches generated at different times in floral ontogeny will define the temporal parameters of AP3 (or PI) action.  In addition, anti-AP3 and anti-PI antibodies will be used to assess whether AP3 and PI proteins actually traffic between cells to effect their non-autonomous functions.  Using complementary biochemical, genetic, and developmental approaches to elucidate the mechanisms by which AP3 and PI act will provide a framework for uderstanding how these floral homeotic gene products attain functional specificity.  Furthermore, these analyses should be valuable in beginning to define the mechanisms by which plant cells communicate with each other to coordinate their growth and differentiation. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
