 "awd_abstract_narration": "A method for increasing the rate of slag-metal reactions during iron and steel manufacture on an industrial scale, will be demonstrated.  The method involves creating an external electronically conducting circuit and applying an electric field across the slag layer to increase the current through the external circuit.  This technique has been demonstrated on a lab-scale for the reaction between iron oxide in slag and carbon in liquid iron, and the reaction rate was increased by over 100%, even at low concentrations of iron oxide in the slag. The method will be tested on other oxides that are relevant to the stainless steel producers, such as Cr2O3 and MnO.  Since scale-up of the process is an important goal, a comprehensive mathematical model will be developed employing software for fluid flow and chemical thermodynamics. This will yield a prediction of fluid velocity, temperature, and composition as a function of position and time in the slag phase.  The lab and mathematical modeling results obtained during this program, along with earlier results obtained on iron oxide reduction, will be used to conduct larger-scale tests. \r\n     Success of this technology will maximize metallic yield, limit or decrease coke (reductant) requirements, decrease refining time and consumption of refining agents, improve yield of alloying elements and minimize waste generation.  In essence, it will lead to significant energy and cost savings along with environmental benefits for the iron and steel producers.  An economic benefit analysis of industrial implementation will be performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
