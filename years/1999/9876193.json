 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n9876193\r\nPolysaccharides, large polymers of sugars, serve structural and communication roles in animals, plants, and microbes.  These molecules are also major raw materials for the production of many foodstuffs, industrial\r\nreagents, and consumer products.  The physical and the biological properties of polysaccharides are dependent on their chemical structure.  Many of the molecular details surrounding the polysaccharide synthases, the enzymes that polymerize these carbohydrates, are not known.  The long-term objective of this research project is to develop model systems for the production of biomaterials and biomimetics for use in the food and industrial fields.  The process of polysaccharide biosynthesis will be characterized, modified, and controlled using the tools of molecular biology, biochemistry, chemistry, and genetics.  A combination of basic science characterization and application-driven approaches will be employed to create novel hybrid biomaterials and to construct new polysaccharide synthases. Also, alternative polymer structures not normally found in nature may be created in some cases.  These new biomaterials are expected to be more resistant to biological degradation or possess altered physical properties.  Microbial hosts will also be metabolically engineered to\r\nsupport the production of large quantities of desired polysaccharides.  Overall, these complementary goals promise to illuminate the catalytic mechanism of these intriguing enzymes and to develop sources of new biomaterials.  A series of education initiatives will expose students from the high school through the graduate level to the vistas and the realities of biotechnology with a focus on career development. The courses and workshops should enhance efficient technology transfer and improve human resources.\r\n\r\nThis research will enhance understanding of the enzymes responsible for polysaccharide biosynthesis. The resulting information should also allow the design and the production of new biomaterials with improved or different properties for use in the biotechnology, food, and industrial fields. In the initial phase, enzymes that produce carbohydrates found throughout the human body will be studied with a focus on developing biocompatible polymers.  In the long-term, explorations of other polymers may yield, for example, industrial lubricants that survive longer in the field, or food polymers that are rendered indigestible and calorie-free.  The ultimate goal of the project's multi-level education aspect is to accelerate the conversion of laboratory discoveries into useful applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
