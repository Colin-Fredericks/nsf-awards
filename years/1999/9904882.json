 "awd_abstract_narration": "When animals produce characteristically different behavior, it is understood that the neural circuits underlying the behavior must have differences.  The focus of this project is to discover, in the context of sexual differences in behavior, how the nervous systems of males and females are differently organized.  A model insect system will be utilized to detail structural and functional properties of individual nerve cells.  Previous work showed that females have a neural circuit that supports a \"female only\" behavior, but recent work has shown that males also have most of the same nerve cells and that these cells can be induced to produce electrical activity similar to that of females.  This study will attempt to resolve how nervous systems with common elements and functional potential nevertheless produce different behaviors.\r\nThe significance of this project is in its contribution to the understanding of the biological basis of behavioral diversity, and in the insight it will provide into the evolution of variation in behavior.  The study will be conducted in collaboration with undergraduate students where it will provide an important, early opportunity in their education as scientists\r\n",
