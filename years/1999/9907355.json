 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation, provides support for a special conference, the Cassidy Symposium, which has been organized to honor Dr. William Cassidy, the founder of the NSF sponsored Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET). The objective of the Cassidy Symposium is to provide a forum for discussion of the impact that the collection and analysis of Antarctic meteorites have had on research in planetary science and on studies related to the Antarctic ice sheet. The timing of the symposium coincides with the retirement from the Department of Geology and Planetary Science at the University of Pittsburgh of Dr. William A. Cassidy, who founded ANSMET and led 15 expeditions to Antarctica beginning in 1976 that resulted in the collection of 7500 meteorites. To date, ANSMET has collected about 10,000 meteorites and is an exceptionally valuable scientific resource for researchers worldwide. Funds from NSF will be used to defer the costs of attendance at the symposium by undergraduate and graduate students and to provide travel expenses for two of the invited speakers.\r\n\r\n",
