 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) provides funding to create four different teams combining faculty and graduate student scholars at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst with Kollmorgen Technology Specialists by bringing the latter to the campus for a two month, full time assignment at the University and subsequent six month period of part-time interaction.  Each team will focus on a different technology taking advantage of an existing alliance to advance innovative concepts that could serve as a model for other institutions in developing stronger ties between industry and academe.  The technical areas to be undertaken will include:  (1) Motion Technology-Components and Systems; (2) Digital Video Processing; (3) Imaging Sensors;  (4) Human-Machine Interfaces; (5) Real Time Software, Embedded Computer and Logic Devices; and  (6) Advanced Structures and Materials.  Industry/Academic teams will expose faculty and students in the industry perspective and the integrative skills needed by engineers in the market.  The University will gain short-term research participants who have been designated by Kollmorgen to be in-house experts in the technologies undertaken during the project.  The presence of industry specialists in the laboratories and the integrative program support will act as a catalyst for faculty and graduate student teams to broaden their scope and consideration of research applications at the same time.  \r\n\r\nThe industry residency and team creation program is designed to help bridge the gap between practice and scholarship in rapidly changing fields of technology.  The research includes an assessment component to examine the milestones of the effort at the nine-month and eighteen-month points of progress.  The lessons learned will be shared with other research and academic organizations upon which to build long term research and support models.\r\n",
