The project, conducted in partnership with NSF-funded research efforts, will link scientists and experts to on-site and online audiences, providing the public with the opportunity to directly experience seismic research and to interact with experts in the field.  This project is intended to explore the use of new interactive technologies to develop a connection between geoscientific research and the Exploratorium's audiences, which include the general public visiting on field trips and using Exploratorium Internet resources.  The objectives of the twelve-month project are 1. To produce a multi-episode Webcast program from points along California faults using innovative remote communications technology, in which geoscience experts and interesting geologic sites are remotely connected to museum visitors and Internet visitors for interactive presentations and discussions moderated by Exploratorium scientific staff; and 2. To develop Internet content, including original materials, interactive online exhibits, archives of the live Webcasts, and links to other sites, that enable Internet users to access in-depth information about earthquakes.  The Exploratorium will enlist the support of partner organizations, including the American Geological Institute, the Southern California Earthquake Center, the U.S. Geological Survey, and geoscientists engaged in seismic research to develop Web resources, produce the Webcast programs from remote science research stations and geologic formations, and to promote the project to a wide public audience.  Evaluation will include tracking Internet visitor patterns of use and responses to an online questionnaire regarding educational value.  Results of the project will be disseminated through the Exploratorium Web site, to partner organizations, and through presentations at national science and museum conferences.  The project will serve as a pilot project for a full-scale Webcast program linking the public with scientific research activities around the world.\r\n",
