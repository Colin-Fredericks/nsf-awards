 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry provides partial support for travel and participation costs for graduate students, post doctoral research associates, and young faculty to attend the Twelfth International Workshop on Ion-Surface Collisions, South Padre Island, January 24-29, 1999.  Topics to be covered at this meeting revolve around the fundamental interactions of ion beams with surfaces.  An objective of this Workshop is to expose chemists and physicists from this country to important topics in this area that has been dominated by European and Japanese scientists.\r\n\r\nThis Workshop on Ion-Surface Collisions will focus on fundamental interactions of ion beams with surfaces and include a diverse participant cohort from physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering disciplines.  A focus of this Workshop will be to bolster this important area in this country to improve the position of this country relative to the more active programs found in Europe and Japan.  Young scientists and students will be supported to attend this Workshop through this project.\r\n\r\n",
