 "awd_abstract_narration": "NJ Tublitz\r\n99-05989\r\n\r\n\tThe long term goal of this research project  is to obtain a mechanistic understanding of behavioral plasticity, the ability to vary the performance of an individual behavior depending upon the internal state \r\nof the organism or on environmental conditions.  This behavioral plasticity is the result of subtle variations in the motor output due to small changes in the motor network both centrally and peripherally.\r\n\r\n\tThe issue of behavioral plasticity will be explored experimentally by studying a unique behavior, Body Patterning Behavior , in the European cuttlefish Sepia officinalis, a cephalopod mollusc related to \r\noctopus and squid. Cuttlefish and other unshelled cephalopods generate a fascinatingly rich  repertoire of transient and sustained body patterns that are used for numerous purposes such as camouflage, prey capture, \r\ncourtship, and intraspecific communication. One of the most intrinsically interesting behaviors in the animal kingdom, body patterning behavior in cephalopods is unique due to the complexity and variety  of patterns as \r\nwell as the speed of pattern formation, usually within 500 ms. The ultimate objective of this research is to elucidate the central mechanisms underlying the production of these complicated patterns, and to \r\nunderstand the role of neuropeptides in modulating this behavior.  \r\n\r\n\tThe work to be performed in the up-coming year will focus on the role of neuromodulators in mediating chromatophore activity.  We have demonstrated that the FMRFamide family of neuropeptides, known \r\nas FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs), stimulate the chromatophore muscles, which in turn causes expansion of the pigmented chromatophores. Previous work has identified a brain transcript that \r\nencodes FMRFamide and three other FaRPs. One focus will be to determine the spatial distribution of the FMRFamide-coding transcript in the Sepia brain using in situ hybridization methods and to determine the \r\nextent of the overlap between transcript expression and FMRFamide expression as assessed by immunocytochemical techniques. The second goal will be to identify other FaRP coding genes in Sepia using molecular methods. The results from these experiments will provide new information on the role of these peptides in modulating aspects of body pattern behavior in cephalopods.",
