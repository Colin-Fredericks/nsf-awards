 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support the University of Michigan will purchase a state-of-the-art 3 Tesla MRI system: a GE Signa LX Horizon 3 T with an advanced development workstation for real-time processing of fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) data. The proposed system will be capable of acquiring up to 18 image slices/second with 20 cm field of view, 64x64 matrix echo-planar imaging over a sustained period. FMRI measures hemodynamic response as a function of change in neural activity in the face of cognitive challenge in behaving humans and thus has the ability to illuminate the brain bases of cognitive processes. The scanner will form the core of a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Laboratory dedicated to basic research studies of cognitive processes. Co-directed by Drs. John Jonides and Douglas Noll, a  cognitive scientist and biomedical engineer respectively, the instrument will be housed in newly renovated space in the University's Neuroscience Laboratory Building. The laboratory will provide facilities for researchers from cognitive neuroscience, neuroscience, biomedical engineering, physics, biostatistics, linguistics, computer science, radiology and psychiatry to explore basic issues in perception and cognition.  It will thus serve to coalesce interdisciplinary work already underway at Michigan.\r\n\r\nTwo types of research will be conducted at the fMRI laboratory. The first involves numerous interdisciplinary collaborations centered around issues of cognitive process. This work concentrates largely on higher cognitive functions, especially memory and executive processes. The basic thrust is to understand the nature of storage mechanisms involved in memory and the relation of these storage mechanisms to processes used to manipulate information in memory. The second class of studies proposed for the new Laboratory center on methodological issues of data acquisition and analysis involving fMRI. One focus of this work will be on continued development of new pulse sequences that are specialized for functional data collection. Expansion and testing of new non-parametric data-analysis tools should also substantially expand the resources currently available for data treatment. The University has developed a number of programs to introduce students to fMRI research and to train scientists in use of the machine. It will actively work to attract under represented groups. The University of Michigan has allocated significant resources both the assist in purchase of the instrument and renovate a laboratory to house it.\r\n",
