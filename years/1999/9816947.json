Technical\r\n\r\nAs a result of the success of single-molecule optical detection and\r\nspectroscopy, first at low temperatures, and more recently at room\r\ntemperatures, a particular opportunity exists to apply these methods to the\r\nelucidation of important outstanding problems in the understanding of\r\nprotein dynamical and functional behavior.  Single-molecule methods\r\ncompletely remove ensemble averaging, thus allowing direct observation of\r\nheterogeneity that is normally hidden.  True distributions of measured\r\nproperties over members of the ensemble may be measured, allowing a\r\ndetailed picture of complex and inhomogeneous environments.  For\r\ntime-dependent processes, following individual proteins one at a time\r\nthrough the enzymatic cycle removes the need for synchronization of the\r\nensemble.  Finally, since the single-molecule limit is a previously\r\nunexplored regime, new and unexpected behavior is likely to occur, such as\r\nthe blinking and switching of single copies of green fluorescent protein\r\nmutants observed recently. This study is an interdisciplinary effort to\r\ninvetigate several aspects of protein and enzyme dynamics and function\r\nusing optical single-molecule detection and spectroscopy with in vitro\r\ntechniques. The important advantage of the single-molecule regime is that\r\nsignatures of the conformational state which are normally buried in large N\r\n(N = number of copies) experiments will become uniquely accessible to\r\nstudy.  The principal biological problems of interest are the photophysical\r\ndynamics of green fluorescent protein and its mutants, the mechanochemical\r\ncycle of kinesin motor protein, and the protein association and enzymatic\r\nbehavior of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.  The stuidy utilizes\r\ndiffraction-limited confocal, total internal reflection, and far-field\r\noptical microscopy and spectroscopy to explore the biophysical behavior of\r\nsingle copies of proteins and enzymes, specifically to fully characterize\r\nand understand the mechanism for the unexpected blinking and switching\r\nbehavior recently observed for single copies of green fluorescent protein,\r\nand to apply single-molecule imaging, polarization, and energy transfer\r\nmethods to explore protein conformational states associated with the\r\nmechanochemical behavior of motor proteins in the kinesin superfamily, and\r\nutilize single-molecule optical spectroscopy and microscopy to detect and\r\ncharacterize the enzymatic action and protein subunit association and\r\ndissociation for cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. To accomplish these ends,\r\nthe PI's physical, chemical, and optical expertise will be combined with\r\nthe molecular biological and biochemical expertise of several talented\r\ncollaborators.  In the final analysis, owing to its multidisciplinary\r\norganization, the fundamental research in this program will not only\r\ngenerate new knowledge about the biophysical properties of several\r\nimportant protein systems, but, in addition the advances in instrumentation\r\nwill provide novel groundwork for technology\r\ntransfer to other relevant disciplines, and the increased knowledge about\r\noptically driven changes in state of fluorescent proteins like green\r\nfluorescent protein may lead to the engineering of mutants capable of use\r\nas optical recording and storage elements.\r\n\r\n2. Non-technical\r\n\r\nThis study reaches into a new realm: that of observing and understanding\r\nindividual, single copies of proteins.  The methods utilized are optical,\r\ni.e., using light to probe individual molecules, which allows us to probe\r\ntime-dependent, dynamical events as each protein copy performs its function\r\nas an enzyme. A key difficulty encountered in most conventional experiments\r\nwhich look at a huge number of protein copies at the same time, is that\r\nsynchronization of the different copies is not easily possible.  This means\r\nthat any inhomogeneity is obscured.  For an analogy, assume that many\r\npeople are in a room, all reading the same text such as the Bill of Rights,\r\nbut that they did not start together.  (In the protein world, this might be\r\nan assembly of proteins each at different stages in the enzymatic cycle.)\r\nSince all the individuals are marching to a different drummer, the net\r\neffect is something like the cacophony that one hears in a crowded\r\nrestaurant.  By developing and using the new methods of single-molecule\r\nspectroscopy, one is effectively able to listen to each person in the room\r\nseparately.  It will then be possible to discern different dialects that\r\nmight be spoken by the different individuals, or even to tell if some of\r\nthem are actually reading the Preamble to the Constitution instead.\r\nReturning to the protein world, this study is expected to learn important\r\ndetails about the exact cycle the protein follows to perform a useful\r\nfunction, and in particular, if some individual copies are intrinsically\r\ndifferent due to the fold of the protein or to some other unforeseen\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\n",
