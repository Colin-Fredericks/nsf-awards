 "awd_abstract_narration": "9903533\r\nGrande and dePinna\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to examine the historical relationship between the Clupeomorpha (e.g., herrings and anchovies) and the Ostariophysi (e.g., carps, minnows, catfishes) with some intriguing new character information. We will conduct a comparative study focusing on the anterior vertebral-otophysic complexes of these fishes.   Our rationale for examining the anterior vertebral regions of these fishes is that, from our preliminary investigations, and from those of other researchers, this region appears to be a source of phylogenetic information potentially fundamental to understanding the relationships of several major clupeocephalan groups.  One important fish group that we will focus on is the Pristigasteroidea.  This is an important group scientifically because it appears to have the diagnostic clupeiform mechanics used to enhance near-field hearing.  Further, the skeletal modifications are strikingly similar to those used by ostariophysans to transmit high frequency sound vibrations.  The Pristigasteroidea may thus hold the key to understanding the origin of clupeomorphs and ostariophysans, two of the largest fish groups in existence today.  If clupeomorphs and ostariophysans are related, then so, too, are their otophysic modifications.  In this study the P.I.s will survey all genera of pristigasteroid fishes for modifications of the anterior vertebrae-gasbladder complex, and describe this morphology in detail for the first time. We will survey and examine representatives of all major clupeomorph subgroups for modifications of the anterior vertebral column as seen in pristigasteroids, and to assess their anterior vertebral modifications. They will construct a data matrix of their findings based on their survey of clupeomorph and ostariophysan taxa.  As a test of character congruence, and to truly test the monophyly of Clupeomorpha, this new character set will be added to those characters already proposed in the literature and analyzed cladistically. \r\n",
