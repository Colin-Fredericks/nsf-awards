The study employs the use of neural network systems and fuzzy estimating logic to indicate the condition of the underground utility. Sanitary sewer systems are selected to test the proof-of-concept, since the maintenance of sewer systems is an increasing priority worldwide. \r\n\r\nSupport from the commercial co-developer of the system and from the Civil Engineering Research Foundation will enable the PI to access field data collected using the new multi-sensory data acquisition technology.  The POWRE award will also enable the research team to observe the operation of the first multi-sensory sewer data acquisition technology in the U.S and to use the automated interpretation scheme to analyze data from different types of sewers, operating under different conditions.  Support is provided under POWRE because the experience with the new technology is considered to provide a significant enhancement of the PI's technical expertise and corresponding career prospects.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
