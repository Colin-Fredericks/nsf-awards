 "awd_abstract_narration": "Novel techniques for the analysis of molecular weight distribution and polydispersity of polymeric materials are proposed.  The primary technique to be developed is time dependent static light scattering (TDSLS), which can be used to continuously monitor absolute weight average polymer mass and static polymer dimensions.  An auxiliary capillary viscometer in conjunction with the other detectors will provide the degree of monomer conversion.  The project aims at developing the instrumentation and techniques for monitoring the widest classes of step-growth and chain-growth reactions possible and to use the best available kinetic models to analyze the real-time data.  An appropriate set of representative reactions of these types will be chosen as model systems for developing the technique, applications, and associated analyses.  Real-time monitoring of polymerization reactions will potentially become a valuable tool in several contexts.  Synthetic chemists developing novel polymeric materials may be able to make an immediate determination of the effects of changing reaction conditions on polymeric materials may be able to make an immediate determination of the effects of changing reaction conditions on polymeric materials.  Rapid analyses of kinetic data will be possible, and real-time data from pilot scale operations may be used to optimize reaction conditions.",
