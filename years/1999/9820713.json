Not only do they serve electronic functions, but also they must\r\nmaintain structural integrity during fabrication and use.  The field of\r\nsmall structures is a relatively new one, to which solid mechanics\r\nresearchers can make substantial contributions.  This proposal addresses a\r\nunifying theme for many problems in this field:  structural evolution.  In\r\na solid structure, diffusive processes can relocate mass, so that the\r\nconfiguration of the structure may change over time.  For example, a film\r\nmay break into islands, and an interconnect may grow cavities.  While\r\nstudies of some of such phenomena go back many years, recent technological\r\ndevelopments demand much more sophisticated capabilities.  Today\r\ngeneral-purpose finite element codes can analyze stress fields in complex\r\nstructures.  However, no such a code exists to simulate evolving structures\r\nwith multiple energetic forces and kinetic processes.  A variational\r\napproach developed recently offers an exiting prospect.  It extends the\r\nestablished approach in continuum mechanics by including mass relocation as\r\nan independent kinematic variable, in addition to deformation.  The\r\napproach can include energetic forces ranging from mechanical stress to\r\nelectron wind, and kinetic processes ranging from grain boundary migration\r\nto surface diffusion.  Attention in the past has been focused on specific\r\nphenomena, such as epitaxial film instability and interconnect voiding.\r\nThis proposal addresses several basic issues that will arise in\r\nimplementing a general-purpose code.  Emphasis is placed on aspects related\r\nto surface energy and elastic energy, because both energetics  are\r\nubiquitous in small solid structures, and because their implementation\r\nissues are generic.  Specifically, we will examine the following aspects:\r\n    *  Surface energy anisotropy\r\n    *  Generalized forces due to elasticity\r\n    *  Strain-dependent surface energy\r\nWe will develop their analytic basis for the finite element method,\r\nimplement them in our computer code, and use the code to simulate several\r\nphenomena that highlight their effects.  The study of the phenomena at\r\nsmall length and long time scales will push the envelope of the Solid\r\nMechanics discipline into a field of great scientific and technological\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n",
