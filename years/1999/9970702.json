 "awd_abstract_narration": "HOCHSTER, 9970702\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to study several problems related to tight closure, \r\nincluding the long open question as to whether it commutes with \r\nlocalization, the relationship of tight closure with Hilbert-Kunz \r\nfunctions, the problem of characterizing tight closure in equal \r\ncharacteristic zero in new ways that will produce better insight \r\ninto the phenomenon, and the central problem of extending the \r\nunderlying idea to rings that do not necessarily contain a field, which \r\nwould solve many open questions, including the long standing conjecture \r\nthat regular rings are direct summands of their module-finite \r\nextension rings. \r\n\r\nCommutative algebra and algebraic geometry may be thought of \r\nas studying solutions of many equations in many unknowns \r\nwhen, typically, the solution is not unique. The set of \r\nsolutions can then be viewed geometrically, but one \r\ncan use instead encode all the pertinent information about \r\nthe equations in abstract algebraic objects called commutative \r\nrings. The two points of view interact in beautiful and \r\nproductive ways. A breakthrough method in commutative algebra that \r\nhas had explosive development in this decade is the theory of tight \r\nclosure. Part of the underlying idea is to consider the system \r\nof equations, after suitable modification, or the ring, modulo \r\nmany different prime integers. This is a powerful technique \r\nthat has solved many problems, while opening up vast new \r\nareas for research.\r\n",
