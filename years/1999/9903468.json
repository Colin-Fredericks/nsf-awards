Some the outstanding scientists in the U.S. and abroad will gather to discuss problems of the amorphous state. The meeting will be highly interdisciplinary and both theoretical and practical aspects of materials behavior and properties will be presented.  The conference will be quite unique in terms of its breadth of scope and assemblage of such a diverse group of investigators. As a result, new insights to arise from the melding of ideas from the leaders of several diverse scientific disciplines is anticipated.  The primary topics to be covered include the glass transition, relaxation behavior, nucleation and crystallization, computer simulations, metallic glasses, amorphous polymers, transport phenomena, glass structure, optical processes and optical glasses,  immiscibility and spinodal decomposition, and fracture.  To guide the organization of this conference, and international advisory committee has been assembled. The meeting will consist of invited and contributed talks and poster presentations. It is anticipated that 125 people will attend the meeting.  Publication of most of the presentations in an issue of the Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids is planned.  In addition, the conference proceedings will be published by Elsevier. A special effort has been made to attract students and young researchers to the meeting.  \r\n%%%\r\nThe International Conference on the Physics of Non-Crystalline Solids is held every four years.  The results of this meeting provide a catalyst for continued vigor in this area of increasing technological importance.\r\n***\r\n",
