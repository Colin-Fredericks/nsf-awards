 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1984, faculty in the Department of Mathematics at Auburn University have organized a total of 25 one- and two-day conferences in harmonic analysis, real analysis, and related areas. The main purpose of these meetings was to enable mathematicians and mathematics students in the universities in the Southeast to interact with each other and with mathematicians and students from outside the region who have also been attending the conferences and to provide a forum for presentation of recent mathematical research. The National Science Foundation began regular support of these biannual meetings in 1986. The current award  will be used to continue this conference activity for the period 1998-2001. Three Miniconferences on Harmonic Analysis and Related Areas will be held at Auburn University during the fall semesters of 1998, 1999, and 2000. Three Miniconferences on Real Analysis and Related Areas will be held at Auburn University (spring 1999), University of Louisville (spring 2000), and California State University at San Bernardino (spring 2001), respectively.  Each meeting will feature hour talks by the (usually 2 or 3) Invited Principal Speakers plus contributed 20-minute talks and problem sessions. All of the funds provided by the grant will be used to pay expenses of participants attending the miniconferences.  Expenses for Principal Speakers are paid in full and local housing, local transportation, and some meals will be provided for all participants. Additional support in the form of additional food allowances and some travel support is provided for student participants. There are no registration fees.\r\n\r\nThese conferences have been effective in stimulating research activity of \"professional research mathematicians\" in the areas of mathematics represented.  Speakers have been attracted from over 30 states and as many as 14 foreign countries in the past 13 years.  Possibly of more importance is the impact this activity has had on the faculty and students at the institution where the conferences are held as well as on faculty and student participants from other universities in the state and region.  Such participants usually make up about half the total who attend.  For the meetings held at Auburn, participants regularly come from UA Tuscaloosa, UA Birmingham, Troy State U, U West Ala, Jacksonville State U, U South Ala, Spring Hill Coll, U Mobile, U Montevallo, Ala State U, AU Montgomery, and Tuskegee Institute, as well as from institutions in the neighboring states of Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi.  For many of these  participants, especially the students, this opportunity for contact with mathematicians and mathematics students from other parts of the country is the most intellectually stimulating experience of the year.  The meetings to  be held in Kentucky and California are expected to yield similar regional benefits.\r\n",
