 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most computer science instructors agree upon the importance of using structured laboratories to provide hands-on activities and projects highlighting the applications of computing.   As the consequence, the science of computing, that is, the discovery process, must be addressed by different means.  This proof-of-concept project is developing a series of interactive discovery-based learning modules to augment the introductory computing course for non-majors. These modules are designed to engage the student in a fully interactive pre-lecture exploration of a topic or topics to be discussed in subsequent classroom meetings.  They are deployed using the interactive capabilities of the World Wide Web.  The learning modules allow instructors to incorporate meaningful exploratory experiences in the science of computing without sacrificing the important focus of core content.   They provide a discovery-based learning approach that provides students with a deeper introduction to computing.\r\n\r\nMaterials are being disseminated through a web site and through the development of a textbook.   The evaluation is being conducted as a controlled experiment to assess improvement in student learning.",
