 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major point of interaction among photosynthesis, photorespiration and \r\nmitochondrial respiration is the reaction catalyzed by the mitochondrial \r\npyruvate dehydrogenase complex (mtPDC). This multi-enzyme complex is the \r\nprimary entry point for carbon into the Krebs cycle for energy production \r\nand the generation of biosynthetic intermediates. The plastid isoform of \r\nPDC provides the precursor for fatty acid biosynthesis, branched-chain amino \r\nacids, some isoprenoids and growth regulators. The mtPDC is regulated in \r\npart by reversible phosphorylation of multiple serine residues catalyzed by \r\na novel and specific histidine-like protein kinase (PDK). Objectives: To \r\nestablish the phosphorylation sites on the E1 subunits of plant PDC; to \r\ncharacterize recombinant PDKs with regard to effectors and kinetics; to \r\nestablish the expression of PDK isoforms as function of plant development \r\nand environmental influences; to establish amino acids essential for \r\ncatalysis and binding in the PDK primary sequence; to establish the \r\nphysiological role of PDKs using transgenic plants over- and underexpressing \r\nPDK and by identifying \"gene knockouts\" of PDK in maize and Arabidopsis \r\nthaliana; to characterize events, mechanisms and modulators of PDC activity \r\nduring development and photosynthesis in C4 and C3 plants; to investigate in \r\nvitro assembly of PDC component enzymes and their import and assembly. \r\nExperimental approach: 1) 32P-labeled E1 subunit will be purified from \r\nthe complexes exhibiting various states of activity and the phosphorylated \r\nserines identified. 2) Effectors and kinetics of recombinant PDK will be \r\ndetermined. 3) Specific hybridization probes and antibodies for PDK\r\nisoforms will be used to measure developmental and spatial expression, and\r\nresponses to environmental and nutritional cues.\r\n 4) Standard site-directed mutagenesis methods will be \r\nused to systematically change specific amino acid residues of PDK, and \r\nactivities will be assayed using kinase-depleted PDC. 5) A. thaliana will \r\nbe transformed; down regulation of PDK and PDH will be accomplished using\r\nT-DNA tagged genomic DNA pools. 6) In vitro assembly studies will utilize \r\nsubunits of component enzymes in conjunction with various chaperone systems; \r\nimport and assembly will utilize purified pea mitochondria and subunit \r\nprecursors. 7) Conditions and metabolites that affect reversible \r\nphosphorylation of mtPDC will be determined using purified functional \r\nmitochondria, protoplasts or whole tissues. Significance: The results \r\nobtained will help clarify control of interactions among multiple distinct \r\ncatabolic and anabolic pathways. The mechanisms and structural requirements \r\nof a unique class of protein kinases will be determined. Factors that \r\naffect expression of PDK and of the PDC subunits will be identified. \r\nDetails of the synthesis, organellar import, and assembly of the components \r\nof PDC will be resolved. Finally, mechanisms for controlling the activities \r\nof plastid and mtPDC will be ascertained. Plastid PDC is likely to be \r\nessential for fatty acid biosynthesis, and unique regulatory properties are \r\nrequired in this subcellular compartment. \r\n",
