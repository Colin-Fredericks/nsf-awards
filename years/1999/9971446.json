Lagrangian intersection theory is the\r\ncore of symplectic geometry, and on the cotangent bundle it is\r\nthe symplectification of Morse theory of the base.  Recent\r\nresults by Oh, Chekanov, Seidel and Polterovich demonstrate that\r\nFloer homology, when defined, is a powerful tool to investigate\r\ntopology and geometry of Lagrangian submanifolds. On cotangent\r\nbundles, Lagrangian intersection theory also provides an\r\ninterpretation of Morse theory, and when combined with the Floer\r\nhomology theory, it encodes symplectic rigidity in a canonical\r\nway.  Outside cotangent bundles there are obstructions to\r\ndefining a Floer theory that come from the quantum geometry of\r\nLagrangian submanifolds.  Oh proposes to further develop\r\nfunctorial constructions in the Floer theory and to apply them to\r\nproblems related to symplectic topology and mirror symmetry.\r\nOther research concerns the variational problem of minimizing\r\nvolume of Lagrangian submanifolds on Kaehler manifolds, which is\r\nclosely related to Harvey and Lawson's theory of special\r\nLagrangian submanifolds. Special Lagrangian submanifolds are a\r\nkey to the geometry of holomorphic volume preserving maps, in the\r\nway that Gromov's theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves played such\r\na role in the study of geometry of symplectic maps.  Oh proposes\r\nto study various analogies between the geometry of holomorphic\r\nvolume preserving maps to that of symplectic maps in complex\r\nEuclidean spaces (e.g. a version of non-squeezing theorem).\r\n\r\nThe process of constructing a quantum formulation of a system\r\nfrom a knowledge of a classical approximation is called\r\n``quantization'' in physics. The lesson learned from history is\r\nthat it is hard to quantize mechanics or geometry, and when a\r\nmechnical system is quantizable, it reveals a very particular\r\nphysical and geometrical nature.  However, quantum formulations\r\nof 3 and 4 dimensional topology have been essential ingredients\r\nin recent breakthroughs in low dimensional topology and it was\r\nessential to quantize classical (differential) topology to derive\r\nthe most delicate non-trivial differential invariants.\r\nLagrangian submanifolds are the most important geometric objects\r\nin symplectic geometry and play a key role in the geometric\r\nquantization and in the recent development of mirror symmetry and\r\nstring theory in physics. This research will aim at, on the one\r\nhand, carrying out this quantization program of differential\r\ntopology and, on the other hand, understanding the inter-relation\r\nbetween symplectic, Riemannian and complex geometries.\r\n",
