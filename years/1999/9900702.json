 "awd_abstract_narration": "The belief that cognitions play an important role in health behavior has a long-standing history in social psychology. In his initial statement of dissonance theory, Festinger (1957) discussed the predicament of a hypothetical smoker who had recently learned that smoking was harmful. Festinger proposed that individuals who choose to continue smoking under these circumstances could deal with this information in two ways: They could deny the relation between their behavior and potential negative consequences, or they could engage in various cognitive strategies that would enable them to continue smoking (e.g., decide that the benefits of smoking outweigh the danger or that the risk is negligible in comparison with that of other activities). Either way, the cognition is likely to have a significant impact on the smokers' behavior and health. The last decade has seen an explosion of research on cognitive processes, like those described by Festinger, that are related to health behavior. In this domain some researchers have primarily addressed pressing societal problems, such as the HIV epidemic, while others have been primarily interested in theoretical issues. Until relatively recently, however, few social psychologists have designed research that served the dual purposes of making fundamental contributions to the development of theory relevant to health cognitions, while generating knowledge that is likely to have significant \"real world\" applications. This conference will bring together a select group of 15 to 20 established scholars to critically examine the theory, methods, empirical data, and applications of this relatively new and rapidly expanding area of scholarship, plus five promising junior investigators interested in health cognitions. There are three primary objectives of the conference. The first is to provide a forum for integrating the scientific literature on the relation between health cognitions and health behaviors. The second objective is to focus attention on methodologically rigorous research that has made both applied and theoretical contributions, thus promoting these studies as models for future research. The third objective is to provide an opportunity for junior investigators to interact with established scholars in this new field of health cognitions. In addition, conference participants will contribute to an edited volume characterized by this dual goal of theory development and meaningful application that should have a significant impact on the development of future research on health cognitions.\r\n\r\n",
