Chrisochoides\r\n\r\nRecent feasibility studies for the  next  generation of Teraflops  and\r\nPetaflops parallel architectures  indicate that these machines will be\r\nmulti-layer systems that consist of  many layers of similar components\r\nfor  memory, processors, and   interconnects with different levels  of\r\nperformance.  Such designs will  widen the latency gap  between memory\r\nand CPU access to a point where no form of CPU-initiated data movement\r\nfrom memory will be satisfactory.  To solve this, research needs to be\r\ndirected  towards hardware like  \"smart\"  memories that are pro-active\r\nwith  regard to  memory-transfers, algorithms,   and software.    This\r\nresearch focuses on the development and evaluation of latency tolerant\r\nalgorithms   and run-time   software  support  systems  for   adaptive\r\ncomputations on a multi-layer  parallel platform that  is \"isomorphic\"\r\nto future Teraflops and Petaflops systems.  This  project will have an\r\nimmediate impact on  Petaflops Hybrid Technology Multi-Threaded (HTMT)\r\ndesign by  providing hardware  designers  with feedback  based  on the\r\nbehavioral and structural  analysis of an end-to-end  unstructured and\r\nadaptive application from fracture mechanics.  Also, this project will\r\nprovide a  testbed for training the   next generation of computational\r\nscientist to effectively  use such multi-layer parallel  platforms and\r\nhelp computer  engineers  to understand the  hardware  requirements of\r\nlarge-scale applications.\r\n\r\n",
