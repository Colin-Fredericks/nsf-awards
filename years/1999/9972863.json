 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972863\r\nOber\r\n\r\nIn the proposed research, a study of the surface and bulk properties of a series of semifluorinated (SF) LC-coil block copolymers will be undertaken.  While unconventional as mesogenic structures, semifluorinated groups provide not only liquid crystalline character but also non-reconstructing, low energy surfaces (contact angles vs. water > 120 degrees).  The competition between liquid crystallinity and microphase separation will be examined.  The planned research will involve a synthetic program closely coupled to detailed structural analysis, including the use of near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) analyses to probe molecular level details of the surface region.  Finally, the choice of appropriate protecting group chemistry used for producing the target SF side groups will permit the surface patterning of these polymers with chemically amplified resist chemistry.  The use of lithography to direct the self-assembly process will be examined both as means of controlling surface energy and explored as a possible means of influencing self-organization of the LC phases and the microstructure.\r\n\r\nStudies of these novel fluorinated, Teflon-like materials offer the possibility of creating new polymers with molecular level control of surface structure.  These polymers have prospects in applications ranging from non-stick coatings for anti-icing structures on aircraft to biomedical devices.  Examination of these fluorinated polymers will also lead to a better understanding of photoresists for advanced microelectronics.\r\n",
