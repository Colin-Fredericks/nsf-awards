 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine the relationship between polyandry and\r\npaternity in the Red-necked Phalarope (Phalaropus lobatus): an \r\narctic-nesting, gender role-reversed, non-territorial shorebird with \r\nuniparental male care. Some females can produce up to 16 eggs in one \r\nbreeding season;in contrast, males are able to produce one brood of four \r\nchicks, unless they are able to fertilize eggs that will be incubated by \r\nanother male.  Because sperm storage occurs in many bird species and \r\nbecause the time between clutches can be very brief in phalaropes (3-4 \r\ndays), there is great potential for first males to fertilize eggs in \r\nsubsequent polyandrous clutches.  Such extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs) \r\nshould be most likely in the first egg of a subsequent polyandrous clutch, \r\naccording to the passive sperm loss model.  EPFs will be determined by DNA \r\nfingerprinting (using multilocus probes) of sequential clutches by the \r\nsame female, using blood and tissue samples from both parents and from \r\nembryos. The project dovetails well with behavioral observations of these birds that will document timing of copulation attempts and successful copulations.  This study extends work on sexual conflict / sperm competition by Oring et al. \r\n(1992) to a non-territorial polyandrous species.  \r\n\r\n",
