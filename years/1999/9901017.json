 "awd_abstract_narration": "9901017  Betty Cheng\r\nThis project bridges the gap between formal and informal approaches to embedded systems development by formalizing part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), an object-oriented modeling notation that is quickly becoming the de facto standard.  Three of the UML notations, use cases, class diagrams, and state diagrams will be investigated; these three models sufficiently represent embedded-systems requirements.  Through formalization, the models can be integrated into a single specification that can be analyzed for consistency, concurrency properties (e.g., deadlock, liveness), and constraint satisfaction.  In choosing the representations, an assessment will be made as to how they can be analyzed using simulation, model checking, and a combination of these approaches.  The specifications will also be assessed to determine how well they can be used to construct automated design transformations that refine the diagrams into design-level specifications.  The investigations will yield a framework for systematically and rigorously developing\r\nembedded systems, where informal requirements are formalized and refined with design information to obtain the corresponding implementation.  A prototype will be developed to support the graphical construction of the models, generate the corresponding specifications, and provide access to the analysis tools.  The formalizations will be applied to increasingly complex case studies to ensure that the approach is applicable to real projects from industry.\r\n",
