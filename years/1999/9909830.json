 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to evaluate a recently developed inorganic resin for strengthening reinforced concrete and steel beams.  The new resin has some major advantages over the organic polymers; inclluding: (i) resistance to fire and high temperature, (ii) resistance to UV radition, (iii) easy handling because the resin is water based and emits no odor or toxins during construction or curing period, and (iv) better chemical bonding with concrete.  It is possible to replace the organic ploymers with the inorganic resin for most applications.  In addition, the use of the new matrix will enhance the use of advanced composites in applications that require fire resistance and long-term durability.  The primary objectives of the proposed research is to obtain: basic information for using the inorganic resin for strengthening of reinforced concrete and steel beams; study the behavior of strengthened reinforced concrete beams under sustained loading, and durability of strengthened reinforced concrete beams under wet-dry and freeze-thaw conditions.  The experimental evaluation will be conducted using fairly large size beams so as to simulate actual field conditions.  This project is a cooperate effort between University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) and Rutgers the State University of New Jersey.  Dr. H. Toutanji will be the principal investigator at UAH and Dr. P. Balagure will be the principal investigator at Rutgers.  The structural Lab at NASA's Marshal Flight Space Center at Huntsville, Alabama will be used for some of the work proposed in this proposal.",
