 "awd_abstract_narration": "9815370\r\nMenges\r\nSince 1988, staff at the Archbold Biological Station have collected demographic and ecological data on thousands of plants of 10 Florida scrub species to answer fundamental ecological questions. Among these are whether population viability is affected by population size and fire regimes, whether long-term population dynamics and extinction are controlled by environmental stochasticity and rare events, whether long-term trends can be predicted from shorter-term data, and whether metapopulation persistence is likely even of local dynamics are unstable. Florida scrub populations have been studied at regular intervals over the last 10 years using consistent measurements, resulting in data summarizing survival, growth, fecundity, and recruitment for use in population modeling. This research has been coupled with intensive investigations of genetics, breeding systems, pollination, seed dormancy and microhabitat requirements. These plant data sets are longer-term and consider more populations than most other studies used to model population viability. These long term data sets allow characterization of environmental stochasticity, essential in modeling population viability and extinction. Data collection from a number of populations quantifies demographic variation with respect to microhabitat and the natural disturbance regime (fire) and allows modeling of population viability through the fire cycle and across metapopulations. \r\n",
