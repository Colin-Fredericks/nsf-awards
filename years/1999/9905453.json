Traditional models of saving behavior, such as the life-cycle-permanent income model, have been unable to rationalize many of the recent empirical findings concerning savings, and there is much debate on the effectiveness of the saving incentives proposed by those models. While there have been many theoretical contributions and advances on theoretical models of saving, the empirical work on saving has only concentrated on some narrow predictions of the theory.  One of the fundamental assumptions of the life-cycle-permanent income model is that agents are forward looking and plan for far ahead into the future. However, there is little evidence that agents have both the financial literacy and the cognitive ability to make retirement plans. Many basic models of saving have failed to recognize that planning for retirement is a complex task, and that many individuals may perform it very imperfectly up to the extreme of postponing the decision until it is too late. In addition, there are no correction mechanisms that prevent planners from behaving incorrectly. Poor planners are not pushed out of the markets, or disciplined in any way, and only at retirement will they discover whether they have made mistakes.  This project examines several aspects of household saving behavior. Using data from a new survey, the US Health and Retirement Study, it documents the facts concerning wealth holdings of households whose head is close to retirement, and investigate many of the reasons for the lack of saving and wealth accumulation. In addition to the traditional economic reasons for the lack of accumulation, it will investigate whether agents look into the future and think about retirement.\r\n\r\nThe richness of information in this new data set concerning Social Security and pension wealth, past economic circumstances, expectations about the future, and individual preferences provides a rather unique opportunity to submit the theory to strong empirical tests. It is possible, for example, not only to empirically document the weaknesses of the life-cycle model, but also to show that the lack of planning is pervasive among American households and a strong determinant for why many families accumulate so little wealth.  The project explores whether the provision of information and financial advice through retirement seminars has any effects on saving. It also explores the importance of vicarious experience and the possibility of learning by looking at the experience of other individuals, such as older siblings who have already gone through retirement. Additionally, it examines new models of saving which incorporate concepts from economic psychology, such as models of procrastination, pain-avoidance, and lack of self-control.\r\n\r\n",
