 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing size of the Internet and the emergence of new applications that require Quality of Service\r\nmandate radical changes in the way that network switches buffer data.  This growing demand for bandwidth has pushed the architectures of existing output-buffered and shared-buffer switches to their maximum scalability limits.  Input-buffered architectures overcome scalability limits by evenly distributing the queuing operations over all ports of the switch.  Scaling the aggregate bandwidth of a switch, however, does\r\nnot necessarily guarantee that an individual application's traffic flow is serviced fairly.  Switches that provide per-flow queuing fairly allocate bandwidth and provide bounded delay.  Existing switches provide either scalability or per-flow queuing, but none provide both.\r\n\r\nThis research will implement a new hardware module that enables a scalable switch to provide per-flow queuing.  This new module, called the WU-iiQ, will add enhanced queuing features to the highly scalable Washington University Gigabit Switch (WUGS).  The logic for this card will be implemented with a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device, enabling it to implement a variety of queuing algorithms.  The WU-iiQ will contain high-capacity Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) to buffer ATM cells and Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) to store data structures and pointers for algorithms that perform per-flow queuing.\r\n\r\nThe flexibility of the WU-iiQ has made the card of interest for several applications at this and other academic institutions.  The reprogrammable logic on the WU-iiQ enables it to implement a variety of per-flow functions, including packet scheduling, traffic shaping, and congestion control.  While all of these projects are different, they can all be implemented by using the same hardware.\r\n\r\nThis project proposes to implement the WU-iiQ hardware and distribute it to research institutions that require such hardware to experiment with per-flow queuing mechanisms.  Documentation for this WU-iiQ module will be made available via the World Wide Web.  A library of commonly-needed hardware functions, including those that implement per-flow queuing operations, will be available for download.\r\n\r\n",
