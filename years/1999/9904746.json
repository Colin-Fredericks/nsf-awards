 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daub\r\nThe goal of this project is to identify and characterize genes involved in a novel pyridoxine (vitamin B6) biosynthetic pathway in the filamentous phytopathogenic fungus Cercospora nicotianae, and to determine the role of this vitamin in active oxygen resistance.  C. nicotianae produces and is resistant to cercosporin, a light-activated, photosensitizing compound that in the activated state, reacts with oxygen through electron or energy transfer reactions to produce active oxygen species including 1O2.   While studies of active oxygen resistance have primarily focused on other active oxygen species such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical, the highly toxic singlet oxygen has received less attention, and thus there are few known biological defenses.   In addition to cercosporin resistance, C. nicotianae also exhibits resistance to other singlet-oxygen-generating photosensitizers.  Prior work identified and characterized the C. nicotianae gene SOR1 (singlet oxygen resistance), required by this fungus for resistance to cercosporin and to other photosensitizers.  Although 1O2 resistance is rare in nature, SOR1 was found to be highly conserved in organisms from four kingdoms, suggesting it also had a conserved metabolic function.  It has recently been demonstrated that SOR1 (now PDX1, pyridoxine 1) is required for pyridoxine (vitamin B6) biosynthesis in fungi, and that it appears to be a component of a previously undescribed pyridoxine pathway present in plants, fungi, archaebacteria, and some, but not all, of the eubacteria.  In addition, it has also been established that pyridoxine is a potent quencher of 1O2.    Neither this new pyridoxine biosynthetic pathway nor the role of  pyridoxine in antioxidant defense have been describe previously.  The specific objectives of this research are to 1) isolate additional genes in the new pyridoxine synthesis pathway by a combination of functional complementation, differential expression, and mapping and sequencing, and characterize these genes, and 2) characterize how pyridoxine and its vitamers function to provide active oxygen resistance by measuring levels and further characterizing quenching ability.\r\n\r\nAlthough oxygen is required for life, biological and medical research has strongly implicated a deleterious role for slightly modified, toxic forms of oxygen in human aging and disease and in damage to cells of all living organisms.   It is known that vitamins C and E can protect against such damage, however the role of vitamin B6 has not previously been recognized.  This work will further define the recent discovery of this novel function for vitamin B6.  In addition, a hitherto unknown pathway for vitamin B6 synthesis has been uncovered, and the genes involved in this pathway will be identified.   This work will lead to an increased understanding of how organisms synthesize vitamin B6 and of the mechanism by which this vitamin acts in cell protection against damage caused by toxic forms of oxygen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
