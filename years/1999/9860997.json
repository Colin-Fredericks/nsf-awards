 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860997\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will merge MPI Software Technology, Inc.'s unparalleled MPI implementation experience with a scientific analysis of the entire MPI 2 standard.  This analysis will examine each major functionality subsystem of MPI 2 as well as the interactions among these. This analysis will guide innovations in scalable and dynamic process startup in heterogeneous environments, and in advanced algorithmic and poly-algorithmic approaches to one sided communication, collective operations, and parallel I/O.  This research shall be accomplished in order to create a quality design of the MPI 2 Standard from first principles, targeting a far-reaching range of present and future systems including NOWs and MPPs.   Also, a prototype of key elements of MPI 2 will serve as a basis for providing the scientific, research, business, and other communities with a quality implementation of MPI 2.\r\n     Small to medium enterprises worldwide, as well as academics and large industries that need to perform scientific and engineering computations, can benefit from cost effective, high performance clusters plus MPI.  Data mining database computations, crash test codes, and semi- commercial academic codes have commercial relevance.  The waning of supercomputer cycle access for scientists has increased the importance of high quality software to harness clusters of cost-effective workstations/PCs and emerging gigabit networks.\r\n",
