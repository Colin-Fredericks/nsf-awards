Improvement in the present understanding of exciton decay and intermolecular effects in polymers and other organic macromolecular architectures is needed.  In this work detailed photo-physical investigations will be carried out to probe the dynamics of organic conjugated rotaxane macromolecules in the condensed and liquid phases.  This work will give much needed insight into the macromolecular structure-property relationships and could lead to the creation of superior organic emitting device materials.  The methodology that will be invoked was chosen in order to gain a deeper insight into the material's structure-property relationships.  It first concerns probing different intermolecular organic materials.  Measurements of the singlet exciton decay by emission in a novel organic conjugated rotaxane polymer will be investigated by femto-second time resolved luminescence experiments.  In various solutions (good and bad solvents) the degree of aggregation (and excimer formation) can be measured by the ultra-fast upconversion technique. The ability of the rotaxane molecules to inhibit the interchain quenching mechanisms will be investigated with a set of molecules with varying numbers of rotaxane groups attached.\r\n\r\nThis research could lead to a qualitative understanding of the role of rotaxanes in inhibiting intermolecular quenching of luminescence.  It will provide a base for a program focused on understanding the dynamics of excitons in these electroluminescent polymers, which could find application toward light-emitting diodes.\r\n",
