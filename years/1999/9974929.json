 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to provide funds that will greatly increase the ability of graduate students to attend the 1999 annual meeting of the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology.  This new Society, which has a membership of over 350, fosters communication and interdisciplinary collaboration among research scientists who are studying how hormones act on the brain.  These hormonal actions include: growth and maturation of the brain, the mechanisms by which we respond to stress, seasonal and other rhythmic changes in mood and behavior, effects on brain of hormones and hormone-like chemicals that are released into the environment, effects on brain of hormones involved in the control of reproduction and fertility of humans and domesticated animals, psychological effects related to stress and reproduction, etc.  The Society brings together scientists who are involved at many levels of discovery, including the molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral levels.  The Society has adopted the founding principle that annual meetings will be student-friendly and will emphasize bringing young investigators into the field.  Specific events are directed specifically to the needs of graduate students.  The funds will allow significant reduction in registration fees for students.\r\n\r\n",
