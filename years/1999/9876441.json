The experimental facility requested includes a wireless network consisting of one primary server, one backup server, and ten mobile clients.  The research topics to be explored include bandwidth conservation schemes and wireless communications protocols.  The following major research projects, among others, will benefit from the real-world mobile computing environment that will be provided by the proposed instrumentation: 1) Design, implementations, and evaluation of delta service extension to a mobile file system cache proposed to enhance bandwidth conservation by minimizing the amount of data transferred over wireless communications links.  Bandwidth conservation is an important research direction, since network bandwidth stands as one of the resource limitations impacting the design of mobile computer applications; 2) Design, implementations, and evaluation of communication protocols for Ad Hoc Wireless Local Area Networks.  Applications of such networks include mobile classroom, corporate meetings, press conferences, disaster avoidance and disaster recovery situations.  Such networks will pave the way for enhanced communications capabilities in situations where the cost of having fixed wired networks is not justifiable.\r\n",
