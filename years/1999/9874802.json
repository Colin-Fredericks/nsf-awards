 "awd_abstract_narration": "EPSCoR will build science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) infrastructure in North Dakota that will 1) increase competitiveness for merit-based grants and contracts; 2) improve research productivity; 3) increase the rate and quality of technology transfer from university originated research to the private sector in North Dakota, and, 4) enhance the development of human resources in North Dakota.  A three pronged competitive grants program designed to improve research competitiveness and productivity will be conducted that includes:  1) a program in which Chairs and Deans compete for funds to improve their ability to hire top quality faculty, 2) peer-reviewed seed grants for new principal investigators, and, 3) a graduate student enhancement program designed to increase research productivity as well as the number of graduates from SEM areas.  The project will also conduct a multi-component human resources program designed to achieve the following goals:  1) increase the opportunities available for students of the North Dakota University System to participate in research; 2) increase the numbers of members of underrepresented groups involved in SEM research activities will be implemented.  Undergraduate research and mentoring programs for the summer months and academic year, which target underrepresented groups, will be continued and upgraded.  These include programs designed in consultation with North Dakota's Tribal Community Colleges and a new program targeting potential women scientists and another geared to facilitate the transition from high school science activities to undergraduate research programs.\r\n\r\n",
