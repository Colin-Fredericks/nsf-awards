Computer-based materials largely will be built with the program Bryce3D.  This program allows the creation of detailed and realistic, two-dimensional representations depicting three-dimensional perspectives of simple and complex geologic structures and landscapes.  The 3D models can be rotated, sectioned, disassembled, or successively unburied.  A series of images can be used to depict sequential geologic histories, such as deposition of successive layers, followed by erosion into realistic-looking landscapes.  This approach is an analog of strategies that have been shown in previous research to be effective in the development of spatial reasoning.  This project will embed spatial learning in the context of real-life, complex problems that are authentic.  They will be taken from among actual problems that geologists deal with in everyday life.  The hypothesis is that this will increase the development of spatial ability and improve the transfer to relevant problem solving.  Materials will be designed to encourage various aspects of critical thinking, such as development and testing of hypotheses.  The model used for the treatment will be one in which students are pre-tested, trained to a criterion level of success, and post-tested.  Experimental methods will be both experimental and quasi-experimental, and data will be both qualitative and quantitative.  Support in being provided jointly by the Directorate for Geosciences and the Division of Undergraduate Education/Directorate for Education and Human Resources.\r\n",
