The Fifth International Conference on Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design (FOCAPD '99) is the only international conference that focuses exclusively on computer-aided design for chemical processing.  This is the fifth conference in this series, which brings together engineers,s cientists, faculty, and graduate students from universities government laboratories, processing industries, and technology companies to assess and critique current research trends and to influence future directions of computer-aided process design.  Topics addressed include: state-of-the-art and challenges in process design, fundamental design theories and methods, environments and new tools for more effective process design, emerging areas, and industrial needs.  The support will be used to increase the participation of young faculty and students at the conference.  This conference represents an educational opportunity for future researchers and practitioners in the chemical processing industries.",
