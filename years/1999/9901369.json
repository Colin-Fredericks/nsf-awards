 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Karl Traube, Mr. Karl Lorenzen will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will continue his archaeological research at the site of Tumben-Naranjal, located in the Quintana Roo region of Southern Mexico. The site is important because it experienced two periods of occupation. It was originally constructed during the Classic Maya period and contains temples, ceremonial tombs and other monuments which characterized the height of Mayan civilization. It and adjacent counterparts were relatively abandoned at the end of the Classic period and remained unoccupied for approximately 900 years. During the late Postclassic period which immediately proceeded Spanish immigration, the site was reoccupied, again by Mayan peoples. Mr. Lorenzen is interested in this latter time period and wants to determine how Postclassic leaders may have established ritual ties with both the abandoned buildings and with other features of the landscape to establish power. He believes that by manipulating and claiming symbolic ties with the Classic elite, Postclassic rulers worked to reinforce their own power. Many high status Postclassic family shrines and tombs are spatially associated with their earlier counterparts. Based on ethnographic analogy and analysis of early Spanish documents Mr. Lorenzen believes that this strategy was an intentional tactic employed by displaced Maya kin-based groups who during periods of migration recreated their lineage histories and transplanted them to the sites they reoccupied. The key component of this specialized approach incorporated a potent form of ancestor veneration strategically placed burials created a fictive patrimony which ultimately served to legitimize site title.\r\n\r\n     In past field seasons Mr. Lorenzen has conducted survey and limited excavation at the site. With NSF support he will carry out test excavations around basal platforms of Late Postclassic shrine complexes as well as simple residential foundations associated with ceremonial architecture. Excavation of refuse deposits adjacent to ceremonial structures will recover artifacts used during ritual activities and provide valuable data regarding the use and function of these structures. Residential compounds will be examined for evidence of ritual architecture such as shrines and alters. The underlying question is how large groups of individuals were organized into functional social units and how status hierarchies developed and were maintained. Mayan archaeologists have come to realize that religious ritual served an important function in this regard and the fact that Tumben-Naranjal was reoccupied, makes it possible to gain unique insight into how this process worked.\r\n\r\n     This research is important for several reasons. It will provide data of interest to many regional archaeologists. It will shed new light onto prehistoric social organization and will assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
