The object of this renewal proposal is twofold:  extend earlier work on steady-state models of free-radical polymerization to non-steady state dynamics, and study chemisorption of multifunctionalized polymer chains onto functionalized solid surfaces from dilute solutions and from melts.  The reaction dynamics of free radical polymerization is driven by the competition between radical formation and radical termination processes, which are in turn driven by the statics and dynamics of the product polymer chains.  The proposed research will be coordinated with an interdisciplinary experimental free-radical polymerization at Columbia supported by the NSF Chemistry Division, and with a program in polymer chemisorption conducted at the SUNY Stony Brook MRSEC.\r\n%%%\r\nReacting polymer systems are of great technological importance, being central to many applications of polymer synthesis and processing in the chemical, microelectronics, automotive, and aerospace industries.  They also play a major role in biology, because many chemical processes in living organisms involve reactive species incorporated into complex macromolecules.  The object of this research is to advance our understanding and ability to predict the reaction kinetics of polymers in the two areas of free-radical polymerization and interfacial chemisorption.  This improved understanding of chemical reaction rates should enhance our ability to tailor polymer properties by improved synthesis and processing techniques.\r\n***\r\n",
