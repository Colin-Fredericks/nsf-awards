 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project is establishing the North Carolina Consortium for Logistics Education (NCCLE), a consortium of educational institutions across the State of North Carolina, for the purposes of developing curricula in global logistics to be administered through the North Carolina Logistics Education Training Center at the North Carolina Global TransPark (GTP/ETC). The North Carolina Global TransPark is an innovative new complex that enables just-in-time global operations by integrating multiple modes of transportation, information systems, and the knowledge and commercial support necessary to manage the increasingly complex flow of goods and information on a global basis. The NCCLE curriculum will be modular, deliverable via a wide range of media, and will lead seamlessly to both 2-year and 4-year degrees in global logistics. Project objectives are focused in broad areas including faculty development, diversity and curriculum development/integration of technology in education. The NCCLE-developed curriculum will broaden technical education in logistics across the State in response to the emerging demands of competitive business strategy that is based on speed in product manufacture and delivery. Faculty development will center on the collaboration between multidisciplinary/multicampus education partners for designing and implementing the curriculum. Diversity issues will focus on the aggressive  recruitment and retention of the traditionally under-represented populations. The primary target audience for the curriculum is the post-secondary student enrolled in, or desiring to enroll in, applied global logistics programs.  A variety of delivery and schedule formats will also be offered to accommodate today's diverse adult learner. With respect to curriculum delivery vehicles and formats, NCCLE will support a myriad of electronic distribution methods ranging from simple e-mail to CD-ROM to simultaneous high-resolution ideoteleconferencing deliverable via a range of media.\r\n",
