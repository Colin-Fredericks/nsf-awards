Poulton, Department of Mining and Geological Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona and Dr. Safwat A. Hussain, Department of Geological and Geophysical Sciences, The National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt.  Others participants are Dr. Ken Zonge, President of Zonge Engineering and Research Organization, Tucson, Arizona and Mr. Hesham El-Kaliouby, who is a Ph.D. candidate at Cairo University.  These teams plan to seek an accurate interpretation method for transient electromagnetic (TEM) data that can readily be applied to ground water and mineral exploration.   Conducting rocks and minerals exhibit electrical properties, which are characterized by a dispersive complex resistivity in the low frequency range, called induced polarization (IP).  These IP effects may be detected using TEM methods.  The researchers plan to develop a method to exploit the IP effect and gain valuable information about the electrical properties of aquifers and minerals.  It will be necessary to analyze the forward problem of finding a voltage response due to the presence of a target having different parameters such as electrical properties, shape, depth, and location, and then to find inverse solution through the use of a neural network to find the properties of the target.  \r\n\r\nScope: The US team is well qualified for this project.  Dr. Poulton is especially experienced in the development of neural networks and use of neural network interpretation of electromagnetic geophysical data for environmental applications.  Dr. Ken Zonge has useful practical experience in this area, and his organization, Zonge Engineering, has the necessary resources.   The collaboration between Egyptian and US scientists is particularly useful to achieve the objectives of the project.  The proposed activity would help locate ground water resources, an important issue for Egypt and other Middle East countries.  The project will help the Egyptian scientific human resources through the interaction with US experts.  The data obtained will help US scientists with developing basic and applied sciences.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities\r\n",
