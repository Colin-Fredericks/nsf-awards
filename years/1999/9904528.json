 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\n\r\nCrabs and lobsters grow by periodically shedding the hard exoskeleton through a process called molting.  Molting and limb regeneration is regulated by hormones produced by endocrine organs located in the eyestalks and body.  Previous studies, however, indicate that control of molting is more complex.  If a regenerating walking leg (limb bud) is removed (autotomized) before the animal molts, molting is delayed 2-3 weeks, which allows time for the lost tissue to be regenerated.  Dr. Mykles and associates have shown that limb buds produce a molt-inhibiting protein, termed limb autotomy factor - proecdysis (LAFpro). The overall goal of this project is to understand how this factor suspends molting processes.  The proposal consists of three specific aims: (1) to isolate LAFpro from limb buds; (2) to determine the mechanism of LAFpro action on target organs; and (3) to determine the role of the nervous system in mediating the response to tissue regeneration.\r\n\r\nThis research has broad application to understanding the control of growth in arthropods as a whole.  Suspension of molting by tissue regeneration is not unique to crustaceans.  Regeneration also delays molting in a variety of insects.  This suggests a common mechanism.  If so, he should be able develop entirely new strategies for controlling insect pests.\r\n",
