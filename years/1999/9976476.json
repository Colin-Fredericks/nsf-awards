 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robert Levis of Wayne State University is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for research that focuses on the interaction of polyatomic molecules with intense near-infrared laser pulses of femtosecond duration. The objectives of this project are to elucidate the coupling mechanism between an intense laser and a polyatomic molecule, to understand the factors leading to dissociation during intense laser ionization, and to develop a time-dependent picture of the radiation molecule interaction.  Photoelectron spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry measurements will delineate the coupling mechanisms for various classes of molecules, revealing the experimental observables of ionization and dissociation probability and the electron kinetic energy distributions.  Energy partitioning between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom will be determined from fragment ion kinetic energy distributions and electron-ion coincidence experiments.  Finally, time-resolved experiments will provide a detailed picture of the evolution of a molecule in an intense laser field.  \r\n\r\nExtremely intense light induces far different behaviors in molecules than does the same color, but weaker light.  The ability of intense light to result in unusual dissociation and ionization processes is assisting in the development of novel optical methods such as high harmonic generation devices and x-ray lasers. Outcomes from these studies have potential applications in a universal ionization method for biological mass spectrometry, new detection methods for chemical reaction dynamics, and methods for coherent control. \r\n",
