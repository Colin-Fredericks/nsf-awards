Haddow\r\nInstitution:\tMichigan State University\r\nProposal #:\t9978777\r\nProposal Title:\tNew Metrics for Characterizing Impulsive Events: Automotive\r\nApplications\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nThis GOALI funded project is concerned with detecting and meaningfully characterizing and quantifying impulsive events that are imbedded in signals. Attention is focused on signals that arise in the automotive industry and as such, the work will be undertaken during a prolonged faculty visit to Ford Motor Company's Science Research Laboratory. The main objective of the work is to improve on the much used spectral-based analysis tools (Fourier series, etc) by developing a more appropriate technique that is better suited to characterize impulsive events. The new approach, based on wavelet analysis, exploits existing techniques used in the field of data compression that efficiently choose a best basis for compressing signals. Thus, the key aspect of the work is to find appropriate bases functions for interrogating the signals with a view to extracting practically useful information. Preliminary work will focus on data collected from relatively simple laboratory based structures. It will then progress to real data from automotive applications. The significance of the work is that modern mathematical signal analysis tools will be introduced to an area that is often slow to adopt new theoretical techniques. The techniques will be tailored to real applications and will have immediate impact to existing problems such as engine knock, sound quality, squeak and rattle, crash worthiness design, etc. While the emphasis throughout is toward automotive applications, the broader application of the proposed work is vast.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
