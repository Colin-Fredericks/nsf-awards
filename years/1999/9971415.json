 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\n\r\n The PI proposes to continue her program to develop methods to study a\r\nbroad range of valuation problems in portfolio management and asset\r\npricing. More precisely, using techniques from the theories of stochastic\r\ncontrol and nonlinear partial differential equations, the PI proposes to\r\ncontinue her research program in the following two general areas:\r\nA. Models with transaction costs: The goal is to investigate (i) the\r\nvaluation of early exercise instruments and exotic derivatives in a\r\nmulti-security framework, (ii) the estimation of hedging probabilities in\r\na relaxed super replication setting, (iii) the impact of a finite horizon\r\nto trading policies, and (iv) the asset valuation with transaction costs\r\nand alternative price processes.\r\nB. Models with stochastic volatility: The goals are (i) the complete\r\ncharacterization and calibration of stochastic volatility functions and\r\n(ii) the analysis of delta hedging and value at risk in the presence of\r\nstochastic volatility and unhedgable risks.\r\n \r\n Financial markets are not \"perfect\" due to the presence of various\r\nfrictions like transaction costs, asymmetric information, stochastic\r\nvolatility, trading constraints, irreversibilities and liquidity. These\r\nmarket imperfections generate unhedgable risks which cannot be priced via\r\nthe existing classical valuation principles. This project proposes to \r\nintroduce novel valuation methodologies and to analyze the relevant\r\nstochastic optimization problems. In addition to the areas of derivative\r\npricing and portfolio management, it is expected that the new results will\r\nbe applied to other valuation systems arising in corporate finance, credit\r\nrisk, insurance theory, electronic commerce and optimal environmental\r\nmanagement. \r\n\r\n",
