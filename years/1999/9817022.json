 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMuscle cells undergo a complex differentiation program which culminates with the functional assembly of the myofibrillar apparatus.  The regulation of this assembly process is not well understood.   There is good evidence that titin, the giant protein of vertebrate muscles, might play a significant role as both a scaffold and ruler during myofibrillogenesis. There is, however, no direct proof of how essential titin is to this process because of the lack of titin mutants. Projectin is another giant protein which is considered a homolog of titin in Drosophila muscles. These two proteins share a similar modular structure and both form thin elongated molecules. Dr. Ayme-Southgate hypothesizes that projectin will form, early in Drosophila development, a scaffold which will then be used to assemble myosin filaments in regular arrays. The availability of projectin mutants allows her to use a genetic approach to test this hypothesis.  The first Aim is to establish primary myoblast/myotube cultures from gastrulae cells of wild type Drosophila embryos. Several reports provide reliable protocols and the general applicability of these primary cultures for both immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies. The cultures will be followed up to the point when myotubes have formed organized fibrils (around 24 hours after egg laying). The timing and pattern of assembly will be established by conventional immunofluorescence for the following myofibrillar proteins: projectin, actin, myosin, alpha-actinin and kettin. In the second and third Aims, the effects of either projectin mutants or myosin heavy chain mutants on the assembly pattern will be evaluated in primary mutant cultures. The effects associated with the mutations will be evaluated at different time points, both by standard immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. In Aim four, a mutagenesis screen will be carried out to obtain new mutant alleles in the projectin gene, with a primary focus on obtaining projectin null allele(s). Mutations will be induced using gamma-ray irradiation, which is known for its high induction rate of large DNA rearrangements. The new projectin alleles will be selected through a standard F2 lethal screen. They will be further characterized both at the protein and molecular levels to identify the mutations leading to the absence of the projectin protein in homozygous embryos.\r\n\r\nThe completion of these four Aims will provide a more complete picture of the steps involved in the formation of the myofibrils in Drosophila embryonic muscles and, in particular, of the role and importance of the projectin protein during myofibrillogenesis.  A demonstration of such a role would also reinforce the significance of the data available for titin in vertebrate muscles.\r\n",
