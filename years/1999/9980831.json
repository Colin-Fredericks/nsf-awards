 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Engineering Microsystems: \"XYZ\" on a Chip project is to investigate a capillary electrophoresis system coupled to microelectrodes for the detection of chemical compounds.  For lab-on-a-chip systems, microelectrodes will be patterned onto glass and silica substrates for detection of substances separated by capillary electrophoresis. The  microelectrodes will be used for both amperometric and potentiometric detection of analytes.  This electrochemically-based technique is proposed as a replacement for laser-induced fluorescence, the predominant detection scheme currently employed in microanalytical devices; however, laser-induced fluorescence is not well suited for micro-manufacturing techniques since it cannot be easily reduced in size to the chip level. Capillary electrophoresis has the advantages of high separation efficiencies, short analysis times, minute sample and reagent consumption, high sample throughput, and easy automation.  Various fabrication techniques including bulk micromachining, surface micromachining, and micro-milling will be investigated to optimize the operation and manufacturability of the device.  Electrodes will be on the order of micrometers for incorporation onto the microchip.  The experimental techniques required to incorporate the electrodes involve essentially the same patterning, etching, and deposition procedures used for fabricating the capillary electrophoresis device.  To optimize channel geometry and electrode placement, electric field and electrokinetic flow modeling will be used for chip design and characterization of electrophoretic processes.  The integrated device may offer capabilities for use in conjunction with rapid DNA sequencing and high-throughput drug screening.",
