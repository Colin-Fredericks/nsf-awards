Kapat\r\n\r\nThis award is to support a theoretical and experimental program to develop, implement, and verify a 3-D Boundary Element Method (BEM)-based inverse algorithm for accurate retrieval of 3-D heat transfer coefficient distributions using either transient or steady state surface temperature measurements as input. The design and analysis of thermal systems and components exposed to convective heat transfer relies on heat transfer coefficients (h) which are usually determined from experiments. Traditionally, precise surface temperature measurements have been used as input to a one-dimensional model for a semi-infinite medium subjected to an impulsive convective boundary condition to extract the values of h. The shortcomings of this approach have long been recognized in the heat transfer community: (1) in many practical applications the heat transfer is actually two- or three-dimensional, (2) impulsive boundary conditions are difficult to achieve in the laboratory, (3) transient experiments have been performed to evaluate h for steady state processes for which h is invariant, and thus this method is difficult to use in a time-dependent process where h varies as a function of time. The proposed method requires only a boundary discretization and includes a new regularization technique to provide robustness to input errors and minimizes the errors due to these three effects. \r\n\r\nA portion of the requested resources will be used to set up a benchmark experiment to validate the method proposed herein. In the experiment, a Thermochromic Liquid Crystal (TLC) thermography technique will be used to obtain the surface temperature distribution over a backward facing step model of various aspect ratios. Once validated the proposed method can potentially replace conventional transient methods that rely on the one-dimensional model.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis grant will impact undergraduate education at the University of Central Florida (UCF) by enlisting students in the capstone Senior Design course into experimental aspects of the work as well as graduate education by introducing inverse methods in graduate heat transfer courses, such as heat conduction and intermediate heat transfer. Additionally, successful completion of the work under this proposal will lead to establishment of proven experimental facilities in TLC thermography at the UCF Energy Systems Laboratory, further the development of the thermal systems infrastructure, and complement existing research efforts in turbomachinery heat transfer at UCF. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
