 "awd_abstract_narration": "The highway system is vital to the economy of the United States.  According to the survey conducted by the Federal Highway Administration, 90 percent of personal travel and 25 percent of freight movement is served by highways.  In 1998, federal, state, and local governments are expected to spend a combined sum of over $106 billion on highways.  A significant portion of it will be used for system preservation, in particular, pavement 3R (reconstruction, rehabilitation, and resurface).  Inspection of pavement surface conditions plays a pivotal role in pavement 3R.  Currently, these inspections are dome mostly by manual visual inspection.  This is a slow, labor-intensive, tedious, dangerous, expensive, and subjective method.  To solve these problems, an automated inspection system needs to be developed.  In this research, we propose to develop a novel 3-D machine vision technique for automated inspection of pavement surfaces.  This technique is based on a color-encoded fringe projection and phase shifting concept that provides high-speed (limited only by the frame rate of the camera) and high-resolution (limited only by the number of pixels in the camera) 3-D surface contouring capability.  Integrated with a specially developed vehicle, the system can provide real-time inspections of pavement surface conditions at normal highway speeds (55 mph).  With advanced algorithms developed based on wavelet analysis, automatic detection, identification, and measurment of various types of pavement distresses can be realized.  Moreover, if global positioning system (GPS) and a map software are used, it is possible to pinpoint the locations of pavement distresses and if necessary, lead the repair engineerrs of workers to the sites.  The objectives of the proposed research are as follows:  1.  Develop a novel 3-D machine vision technique based on color-encoded fringe projection and phase shifting for high-speed, high-resolution pavement inspection.  2.  Develop a special vehicle that incorporates the 3-D machine vision system and GP5 for automated pavement data collection at highway speeds.  3.  Develop algorithms for sutomatic detection and quantitative evalutation of pavement surface distresses based on wavelet analysis techniques.",
