Walder, US Geological Survey, in collaboration with Dr. Hugo Moreno, Observatorio Volcanologico de los Andes del Sur, on a study to assess hydrologic hazards near volcanoes.  The research will be carried out  at the Observatorio Volcanologico de los Andes del Sur in Temuco, Chile, which is located near several active, snow and ice-covered volcanoes, and not far away from hydroelectric dams potentially endangered by lahars (volcanogenic debris flows.)  Up to now maps depicting volcano-related hazards have relied on historical records and detailed geologic studies to estimate the boundaries of hazard zones for future events.  The objective of this work is to understand hazardous volcanic phenomena at a fundamental level, and to develop physically based models that can be used to make plausible predictions of future hazardous events and define hazard zones.  Field investigations will be aimed at making observations, focused on developing hazards-assessment methodologies  related to the hydrological effects of lava-flow movement over snow and ice.   \r\n\r\nWith his  background in glaciology and hydrology the US PI will develop physically based methods for assessing hazards from the lahars entering lakes, while the Chilean investigator's expertise in volcanology will provide the necessary background information and data from previous eruptions and provide and facilitate access to field sites.     \r\n\r\n ***\r\n\r\n",
