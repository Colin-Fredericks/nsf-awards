Boyer and Krzysztof Galicki\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessors Boyer and Galicki propose to investigate several\r\nprojects in geometry and topology. The objective of all the\r\nprojects is to investigate fundamental questions in Riemannian\r\nGeometry with the two main focal points, Contact Geometry and\r\nEinstein Metrics.  The questions and problems proposed here are\r\nbased on the principal investigators' work which exploited a\r\nfundamental relationship between contact geometry of\r\nSasakian-Einstein spaces and two particular kinds of Kaehler\r\ngeometry. These are the Q-factorial Fano varieties\r\n(Kaehler-Einstein metrics with positive scalar curvature) and the\r\nCalabi-Yau manifolds (Kaehler Ricci-flat metrics).  Our recent\r\nwork has led to a significant progress in studying many classical\r\nproblems as well as resulted in the development of completely new\r\ntechniques. Most notably, we were able to construct compact\r\nlocally irreducible positive scalar curvature Einstein spaces\r\nwith arbitrary second Betti number in any odd dimension greater\r\nthan 5. We now are at the point where several classification\r\nproblems and conjectures described in this proposal appear to be\r\nwithin our reach. Furthermore, the type of Einstein geometry that\r\nwe are studying has recently become of interest in Theoretical\r\nPhysics in the context of superconformal field theory and string\r\ntheory, and gives our work an interdisciplinary flavor.\r\n\r\nMathematics is the foundation upon which our modern technology is\r\nbuilt, and much of its understanding and development must preceed\r\ntechnological progress.  Nevertheless, our research into a\r\nparticular type of geometry is closely linked to some important\r\nproblems in modern Theoretical Physics and should provide an\r\nimportant mathematical basis for their understanding.\r\n",
