 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across different countries, the need is urgent for more profound analysis both in order to understand the knowledge economy's dynamics, and to identify the most appropriate routes for policy to support its development.  Without analysis, the risk is that the \"knowledge economy\" will remain a slogan without substance.  With this funding, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development's Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) will continue its work on knowledge processes in learning societies in the following areas:  the management of knowledge; measurement to understand the knowledge-based economy, and, a new research agenda for learning societies.  \r\n\r\nThe research plan includes cooperation from the U. S. Department of Education and other units of the OECD.  Expected outcomes from the project are published reports, a forum on the analytical framework for new indicators for the knowledge-based economy, and an international conference for researchers to obtain a more profound understanding of how individuals learn which contributes to the development of lifelong learning societies.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide new insights into the development of indicators of a knowledge-based economy and constitute part of our research effort for future Science and Engineering Indicators reports.\r\n\r\n",
