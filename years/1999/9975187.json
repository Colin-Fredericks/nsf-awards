The proposed research focuses on the questions: Given their randomness, what can one say at all about random solids? Can one characterize their structure and and their response to perturbations? Do they exhibit universal aspects that transcend any particular material?  Are there any senses in which random solids are simpler or more universal than their crystalline counterparts?  Can one develop an accurate theory of the highly unusual transition to the random solid state?  What light, if any, do vulcanized solids shed on glassy matter?  These questions will be attacked using statistical mechanics, statistical field theory, and large-scale computer simulations.   The PI plans to work on other topics of condensed matter theory including aspects of superfluidity in Bose-Einstein condensed alkali-metal gases and liquid helium-three, electrical properties of magnetic compounds, and biology inspired questions concerning the spatial structure of macromolecules.  The proposed research provides important educational opportunities for the next generation of condensed matter theorists.  \r\n%%%\r\nThis award supports fundamental theoretical research into the nature of disordered solids, many of which are ubiquitous in our everyday experience.  These include rubber, glass, and many foodstuffs.  The PI will use state-of-the-art techniques in theoretical condensed matter theory to investigate the nature and properties of these materials.  The research environment will provide quality educational opportunities for the next generation of condensed matter theorists.\r\n\r\n",
