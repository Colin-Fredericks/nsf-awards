 "awd_abstract_narration": "9901416\r\nJones\r\n\r\nProfessor Jones and Inglefield will study high permeability polymers including substituted polyacetylenes and Amorphous Teflon (DuPont Trademark).  Typical interpretational approaches which will be used by them to understand permeability and sorption data are the dual mode model and free volume theory.  To obtain a more molecular view, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( NMR) will be the primary technique employed in their study.  NMR is capable of both the penetrant and the host matrix.  Specifically spin-lattice relaxation times and one and two-dimensional (2D) line shape experiments will be used to characterize reorientational motion of either the penetrants or the polymer backbone.  Deuterium and carbon-13 and xenon-129 have also been employed in this experiment by Jones and Inglefield at Clark.  At a molecular level, intermolecular dipole-dipole spin-lattice relaxation can provide information on translation as can one and two dimensional xenon-129 line shape experiments.  Two levels of structural experiments will be performed.  The first class is proton spin-diffusion experiments to measure domain size of the regions containing penetrant molecules and also xenon-129 chemical shift measurements which are sensitive to pore size and cluster size.  The second set of structural experiments is for local intermolecular structure such as 2D zero quantum spin exchange, REDOR and DRAMA.  These short range structure experiments may be especially interesting in high selectivity materials.  The information on local length scales will be meshed with long range measurements of mobility by PFG NMR or classical permeability.  The state of the polymer itself is relevant.  For instance, high concentrations of permeant can lower the glass transition of the matrix impairing the mechanical properties of the membrane.  In blends, selective swelling of domains by the penetrant can alter that changes of the matrix mobility with concentration can be established.  Systems based on blends, aerogels and polymer/aerogel composites will be studied with the same experimental strategy.  Some consider high free volume, high permeability polymers to behave more like silica aerogels so a direct comparison of molecular level mobility of permeants can be used to test this view.  In blend systems, the extent of dynamic coupling of the segmental motion of the polymer components can be compared with the nature of translational diffusion through the blend.  Domain size of concentration heterogeneities in the blend is expected to affect both permeant mobility and the level of dynamic coupling between polymer chains.  Barrier and highly selective materials will be studied as comparisons to the high permeability materials.\r\n\r\nProfessors Jones and Inglefield will further the molecular level understanding of structure and motion of gases and other small molecules in materials used as separation membranes and barrier films.  Industrial use of synthetic membranes to separate gases and liquids is already significant but there is continued development of new materials designed to improve efficiency through higher permeation rates and better selectivity.  Conventional polymers are currently used as the basis of many synthetic membranes but a new classical techniques involving extensions of standard descriptions employed for the more conventional polymers.\r\n",
