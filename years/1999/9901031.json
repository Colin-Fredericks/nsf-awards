One of these models, proposed by the PI, uses as its basic modeling component, a functional architecture derived from the software specifications. The derivation of the architecture from these specifications is currently performed manually by a knowledgeable analyst. The aim of this proposal is to investigate the feasibility of an approach to the automatic derivation of the software functional architecture. The approach proposed combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and constrained grammars. The benefit of this research will be to automatically create the functional architecture used in software engineering. An additional benefit is that the architecture can be used as input to tools for model-based automated black box testing and hence the automatic translation should help relieve some of the burden and potential for error encountered in functional testing. This research will impact the fields of software engineering, software reliability, safety and security, and software testing. It will also support the education of graduate students and increase the visibility of woman-led research.        \r\n",
