 "awd_abstract_narration": "This set of projects investigates several fundamental questions in the economics of formation, technology, and organizations by examining patterns in information technology (IT) adoption and organizational change in the United States trucking industry since the mid-1980s. The focus is on the diffusion of on-board computers and changes in the governance structure used to mediate trade between carriers and shippers. As of 1987 almost no tractor-trailers had on-board computers installed; by 1992, about 20% of the U.S. fleet did. During the same period, carriers and shippers began to use longer-term contractual arrangements. Between 1987 and 1992, about $25 billion in shipping transactions -- roughly the revenues of the entire rail industry -- moved from spot markets to long-term contracts or internal procurement. On-board computers provide information that can be used to improve incentives and coordination within carriers and between carriers and shippers. Economic theory suggests that adoption may be accompanied by organizational change. The concurrent technological and organizational changes in this industry offer an opportunity to explore a series of long-standing issues, including: Does the diffusion of new information and communication technologies favor transacting through markets or within firms? How, where, and why do information costs impede transacting through spot markets? How, where and why do they impede transacting within firms? How do local market conditions affect governance? How wide is the scope of hold-up based theories of governance? How does IT affect productivity, how large are the productivity gains associated with IT use, and where are the productivity gains the highest?\r\n\r\nThe empirical work will use data from the Bureau of the Census' Truck Inventory and Use Survey. The projects in this proposal use truck-level data from the 1982, 1987, 1992, and 1997 surveys. Each survey contains observations of 25,000-40,000 heavy-duty truck-tractors. Variables describe trucks' attributes and use. Attributes include trucks' make, model year, engine size, and whether different classes of on-board computers are installed. \"Use\" variables describe trucks' base state, how far from home they were operated, the type of trailer to which they were commonly attached, the classes of products they typically hauled, the governance form under which they typically operated, and various measures of capacity utilization. These data are ideal for studies which apply analytic frameworks that take trucks or, because individual trucks are used in consistent ways from day to day, shipping transactions as the unit of analysis. Decisions regarding on-board computer use and governance are made both at the transaction---as well as the firm--level. The level of disaggregation in the data provides for a good fit between theoretical and empirical frameworks.  It also permits direct application of standard theories of contracting and governance, which commonly take the transaction as the unit of analysis.\r\n\r\nThis proposal describes three projects. The first project develops a model in which new information can affect governance in several ways suggested by theories of organizations. It then tests propositions from this model with estimates of relationships between on-board computer adoption and changes in governance. The empirical work exploits the availability of multiple cross-sections of data. The second project investigates the scope of hold-up-based theories and examines the extent to which changes in governance between 1987 and 1992 were due to factors other than on-board computer diffusion. The third project explores the productivity improvements associated with on-board computer use: the degree to which it has increased capacity utilization and fuel economy. This study exploits differences in on-board computer use across hauls and time. These projects are both of interest by themselves and as inputs to complementary future research which investigates relationships between technological change, market formation, and industry structure.\r\n",
