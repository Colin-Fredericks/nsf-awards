These instruments will be located in an on-campus research laboratory complex, and integrated into upper division undergraduate laboratory courses in semiconductor devices, VLSI, and ultrafast optoelectronics.  Such research facilities tied to undergraduate courses do not currently exist at Oklahoma State University (OSU), and are needed to provide qualified graduates to Oklahoma industry, and as a source of well trained candidates for the strong existing graduate photonics program.\r\n\r\nOSU is the world leader in application of THz optoelectronics, and the requested equipment will provide capabilities to extend THz measurements beyond current limitations imposed by insufficient dynamic range.  THz optoelectronics is based on the integration of sub-picosecond optical pulses with micron scale antenna and transmission line structures.  Applications include spectroscopy, next generation high speed interconnects, electromagnetic scattering studies, imaging, and semiconductor characterization.  Key to remaining competitive in this area is the capability of photolithographic circuit fabrication in order to create a closed cycle to rapidly design, prototype, and test new devices.  The addition of fabrication capability is critical for rapid development of THz optoelectronics.  Currently device fabrication relies on facilities located at the IBM Watson labs in New York.  The turnaround time on new devices can be as long as one year, seriously compromising the ability to make rapid advances.\r\n***\r\n",
