 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1998, Racquel Aquillon, a representative from Multnomah County working with Latina girls at Clara Vista, approached Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) to request help in creating a program which would address the retention of Latina girls who are at the highest risk of dropping out of school and who had, in her words, \"given up on math and science.\"\r\n   OMSI is interested in furthering its association with the Latina community, in addressing issues in math and science specific to young women and in expanding its understanding of unique issues facing these communities.\r\n   This proposed planning grant seeks funds to:\r\n   o  host three symposia which will inform, facilitate discussion, and prepare OMSI staff and community                collaborators to effectively plan a program \r\n   o  prototype recruitment and mentorship activities involving Latina girls in third and eighth grades, as well        as recruitment and science inquiry training activities for Latina preschoolers and their parents, to                 evaluate the feasibility of  proposed approaches for a future large collaborative project, and\r\n   o  collaborate with community leaders to write one or more large collaborative grants for comprehensive           programs to address the recruitment and retention of Latina girls in science and technology, including             preschool parent/child education, girls science clubs for third through eighth grades, camp-in programs        linking professional women scientists to young Latina women, camp and class opportunities, special                projects, including girls' web design classes, family events, community science fairs with Latina girls           (club members) in leadership roles, and peer mentorship and volunteer opportunities for Latina girls.\r\n   Three symposia would afford OMSI and community collaborators the opportunity to build an extensive knowledge of gender equity and Latino community issues.  The intention is to use the symposia as a stage for discussions and planning sessions around relevant topics, using nationally renowned professionals to inform and launch discussions.\r\n   During the course of the planning grant, OMSI will work with girls from project OFELIA, a program of OCHA (the Oregon council for Latina Advancement) to test and document the feasibility of proposed strategies.\r\n\r\n",
