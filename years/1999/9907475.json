 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is a supplement to the funding for the Engineering Research Center on Power Electronics Systems at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University for the purpose of supporting collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The purpose of the effort is to address the need for low-cost power electronic systems at both the power converter level as well as  integration of the converter into the final accessory system.  These systems will be suitable for mass production for use in power systems in the automotive industry.  The objective of the effort is to develop powere lectronics packaging processes that are tailored for large-scale, high-yield, manufacturing.  This involves designs that eliminate the need for conventional wire-bond device attachments.  The design will have convenient integration of passive power components into the packaging plus thermal, mechanical and elcetrical considerations.  The power converter and the motor-based automotive accessory will be integrated into a single seamless package.",
