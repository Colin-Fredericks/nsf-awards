The research encompasses an experimental study of unstable nuclei with an extreme neutron-to-proton ratio.  These exotic nuclei are close to the nuclear driplines, the locus in the chart of nuclides where the binding of nucleons ends.  Even though nuclear shells are well established close to the valley of stability, theoretical models have predicted the possibility of a drastic change of conventional nuclear shell structure as the nuclear driplines are approached.  Such a dramatic change in nuclear structure poses particular challenges for our understanding of the rapid neutron capture process in stars.  This so-called r-process accounts for the generation of more than half of all elements heavier than iron in the universe.  Since measurements of masses, half-lives, and deformations on the very neutron-rich nuclei in the r-process path are extremely scarce, theoretical models are currently used to calculate these properties.  In the absence of experimental data on very neutron-rich nuclei the predictive power of currently used theoretical models is untested.  To remedy this situation, the research proposed here will use different experimental techniques to measure basic properties of exotic nuclei, produced at the NSCL by fragmentation of beams of stable nuclei.  Enhancing scientific literacy at all levels is the goal of the proposed educational activities.  This effort will focus on three specific target groups: high-school students traditionally underrepresented in science, current pre-college science teachers, and undergraduate students (especially prospective teachers).  An expansion of the NSCL summer outreach program (\"Physics of Atomic Nuclei\") is proposed.  The purpose is to allow high-school students from groups traditionally underrepresented in science to experience the excitement and joy of science in an active research environment early enough in their careers that they can choose to pursue a career in science.  At the same time middle and high-school science teachers are invited to the NSCL to get direct exposure to basic research and to learn how they can integrate basic research results into their classes.  At Michigan State University, science education of undergraduate students in general and prospective teachers in particular, takes place in large lecture classes.  Implementation of an active learning environment that makes use of modern technological teaching aides in such large lecture classes taught by the principal investigator is proposed.  The format will shift from a traditional, teacher-centered classroom toward an interactive, student-centered forum where students can examine their own and new ideas, learning through conceptual understanding rather than listening alone.  Segments in this interactive environment will highlight basic nuclear physics research at the NSCL and thus emphasize the relevance of introductory physics concepts through their connection to cutting-edge basic research.\r\n\r\n",
