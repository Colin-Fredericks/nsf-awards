 "awd_abstract_narration": "The practice of mechanical engineering requires the ability to investigate and analyze complex thermal and mechanical systems.  An effective way for the students to develop their understanding of mechanical engineering systems is for them to get hands-on experience by working in small groups in a laboratory environment.  To provide these opportunities, a required mechanical engineering capstone laboratory course is being revised in this project.  The new Engineering Systems Laboratory course is based upon an integrated sequence of laboratory experiments on an automobile and its subsystems.  The automobile is chosen as the system to study because it is compact, relatively inexpensive and in the direct realm of experience of most students.  More importantly, its many complex subsystems provide opportunities for the students to apply the spectrum of their mechanical engineering knowledge, including the principles of mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, and controls.  This project is developing a laboratory manual, a series of library/internet research exercises, and an instructor's guide for the course, evaluating the effectiveness of the developed course materials and appropriateness of the course contents, and identifying the appropriate commercial dissemination mechanisms for the materials developed.   The materials are grouped into learning modules, and four modules will be produced in this proof-of-concept project.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken in this revised laboratory course is to have the students investigate the same system through a sequence of complex experiments and analyses.  The course culminates with the students performing an integrated analysis of the semester's results and recommending changes in the experimental design, the vehicle design, or both.  The Engineering Systems Laboratory helps students to develop a systems perspective and also gives the students experience in designing experiments, applying computer-based instrumentation to study system performance, documenting their results in writing, and making oral presentations.",
