 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Jan Simek and his colleagues will record and date Southeastern USA rock art sites. Although such occurrences were first discovered in the 1950s recent research has demonstrated that prehistoric Native Americans across much of this region entered the \"dark zone\" of caves where no light penetrated and engraved, painted and sculpted cave walls. In some instances layers of mud which naturally covered the walls were formed into bas reliefs and these fragile forms are highly susceptible to destruction. Through analysis of a series of sites, many discovered by Dr. Simek and his team, it has been demonstrated that the earliest examples date to ca. 2,500 and that the tradition continued into historic times. In some cases the art is associated with human burial or other activity such as flint mining. In others the occurrences are isolated. Because artificial light sources were required to produce the art, burned torch fragments, amenable to radiocarbon dating, have been found. Dr. Simek and his colleagues will collect a large series of radiocarbon samples and submit these for laboratory analysis. Photographs and related data will be archived in an electronic database at the University of Tennessee and will be made available to resource managers and scholars interested in Southeastern prehistoric art and religion; electronic storage of the data will greatly enhance access for the archaeological community. In conjunction with basic documentation, detailed contextual studies will be performed in several art caves. Analysis of iconographic content, spatial variation of individual images, and aspects of composition will be undertaken. This will shed new light on the variation and spatial distribution of prehistoric Southeastern behavior. \r\n\r\n     This research is important because it will increase understanding of the cave art phenomenon itself, its evolution and cultural context, and will aid in developing plans for conserving and protecting these rare and precious archaeological resources. Many of the cave art sites are on private land and menaced by looters and vandals.\r\n",
