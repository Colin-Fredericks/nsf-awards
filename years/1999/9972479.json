 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department at Macalester College is upgrading a high field NMR spectrometer for the purpose of interfacing the instrument to the campus network. The goal of this upgrade is to permit students to remotely process data from their undergraduate laboratory experiments. The instrument is a Gemini 300B 300MHz NMR spectrometer (NSF-ILI grant) and is used in student-faculty research effort and in several of undergraduate courses. \r\n\r\nIn order to promote curricular change, gains from NSF supported projects (NSF-CHE 8620242 and NSF-USE 9153106) have been adapted in our sophomore level organic labs and upper level chemistry labs. Organic chemistry students now have greater access to data acquisition and analysis. Upper level adaptations include the use of Fuson's curriculum (NSF-USE-9152169) for studying FT NMR in our Instrumental Analysis course, which places primary emphasis on activities and investigations on the nature of the NMR experiment.  Our Advanced Organic Chemistry course provides a suitable backdrop for the introduction of a variety of workhorse 2D NMR techniques to our curriculum.  NMR analysis, on combination with our recently acquired molecular modeling capability, spawns open-ended student laboratory projects for the determination of structure and conformation of interesting molecules. Additionally, the works appearing in J. Chem. Ed papers of Mills(1996), Midland (1994), and Lee (1996) are adapted with the goal of developing new pedagogically interesting examples.  In this venue students learn to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules with two-dimensional experiments and to study exchange phenomena and the dynamics of molecular interactions. \r\n",
