The emergence of new actuation and sensing concepts and technologies for fluid flow systems is creating an opportunity for control engineering to make a major impact on a number of flow-related applications, including delay of transition and separation, turbulent drag reduction, mixing enhancement, jet control, noise reduction, chemical reactions, combustion instabilities, plasma and fusion physics, etc. The rate of progress and investment into actuator/sensor technology and the development of experimental capabilities has created an unprecedented situation that the theory is lagging behind technology. The objective of this workshop is to provide a major thrust towards channeling the theoretical and computational talent in the field of flow control towards problems that are relevant and on a faster track to transition into products. The workshop is not intended to be a broad overview but instead focus on basic research issues in control theory, computation, and control-oriented modeling. The problems of control of fluid flows are likely to drive the cutting-edge development in control theory and related fields for decades to come.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be organized in conjuction with the 1999 American Control Conference in San Diego. It is likely that the workshop will attract a significant number of conference attendees. A deliverable of the workshop will be proceedings with abstracts of all the talks.   \r\n***\r\n",
