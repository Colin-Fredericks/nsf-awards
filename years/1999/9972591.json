Antoulas, Rice University\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to investigate problems of approximation of \r\nlinear operators. The approximation method considered is based on the \r\nsingular value decomposition of the operator in question. More precisely, \r\nwe propose to study the existence of a unifying framework for the optimal \r\nand sub-optimal approximation of (i) unstructured operators in finite \r\ndimensions, and (ii) structured (Hankel) operators in infinite \r\ndimensions. It is expected that this study will shed light on a large \r\nclass of singular-value-decomposition based approximation problems.\r\n\r\nIn order to predict the behavior of dynamical systems such as, a \r\ncompact disc (CD) player,  a chemical reaction, or a multi-story building, \r\nand appropriately modify (control) this behavior according to given \r\nspecifications, a mathematical model is needed. Often, (detailed) models \r\nfor these dynamical systems can be obtained using so-called finite-element\r\nmethods. The resulting complexity of such models is very high. However, \r\nfor both simulation and control purposes low-complexity models are needed,\r\nan important requirement being that these simplified models retain key \r\nfeatures of the original high-complexity systems. The purpose of this \r\nproject is to study approximation methods which yield low-complexity \r\nmodels with (theoretically) guaranteed properties. This is a necessary \r\nstep towards addressing, in a second phase, the problem of control of \r\nsuch dynamical systems. It is expected that this project, besides its \r\nsignificance for mathematics, will have an impact on application problems \r\narising in several engineering disciplines, and on the theorerical \r\nfoundations of high performance computing. \r\n\r\n\r\nSub-project on internet based education\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe advent of the internet is radically changing the way teaching is \r\ndone at universities. An important new concept in this regard is that \r\nof \"Asynchronous Learning\", where students learn anytime, anywhere, \r\nand at their own pace, using the internet. A key ingredient in this \r\nmode of learing is access to online exercises, with the capability of\r\ninstantaneous grading and feedback both for the student and for the \r\ninstructor. In traditional courses, the instructor gets feedback on \r\nhow well students have understood a certain concept at a later time,\r\nwhen instruction has moved on to a new topic, and re-elaboration \r\nbecomes cumbersome. This issue can be addressed by making available \r\nonline excercises and tests which are graded instantaneously. Careful \r\nselection of the exercises is required however, so as to help the \r\nbeginner and challenge the advanced learner. We propose to study the \r\nissue of \"automatic problem generation and grading\" for a course in \r\nthe broad area of linear algebra and dynamical systems. We will start \r\nby reviewing and evaluating several existing methods for computer-based \r\ngeneration and grading of assignemnts, for instance: (i) the \"Mallard\" \r\ninstructional environment developed at the University of Illinois, \r\n(ii) the \"Autodidact\" instructional environment developed at the \r\nUniversity of Grenoble; the former is a general platform which can in \r\nprinciple be adapted to handle many different courses, while the latter \r\nis geared towards courses in dynamical systems and control. It will \r\nsubsequently be decided whether to adopt one of these existing \r\nplatforms and/or the degree of modification required to address the \r\nneeds of the chosen course.\r\n\r\n",
