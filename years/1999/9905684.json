 "awd_abstract_narration": "The molecular pathways that control the development of the head are not well understood.  In this project, we will use the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to study these pathways.  Analysis of the central trunk region of the fly led to greater understanding of the genes that govern pattern formation.  Although head and trunk development utilize many of the same genes, the molecular interactions that pattern the two regions are very different.\r\n\r\nWe showed previously that the Hedgehog (Hh) protein, which mediates intercellular communication in invertebrates and vertebrates, specifies the fate of the medial region of the fly head.  Our preliminary results suggest, however, that Hh acts through a different pathway in the head primordium than in other tissues.  We also identified a new gene that participates in medial head specification.\r\n\r\nIn the first aim of this proposal, we will continue to study the molecular pathways through which Hh acts during head development.  We will test the hypothesis that Hh activates a second signal transduction cascade, controlled by the Notch protein.  We will also determine whether proteins involved in Hh signaling in other tissues act downstream of Hh during head development.  In the second aim, we will study the new gene we identified, which appears to encode a kinesin-like protein.  WE will analyze its expression and function during embryonic and imaginal development and determine if it acts directly in the Hh pathway.\r\n\r\nUsing the powerful experimental approaches possible in Drosophila, we will learn more about the molecular basis of head development.  Since the genes that pattern the head have been evolutionarily conserved, our results will provide a foundation for studying head formation in higher animals.  Ultimately, these studies will contribute to understanding how genetic defects disrupt normal pathways of development.\r\n\r\n",
