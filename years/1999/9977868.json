 "awd_abstract_narration": "As next generation high performance networks are deployed and it becomes practical to move large amounts of data over the internet, scientists and engineers will have the ability for the first time to analyze and mine remote and distributed data in casual way.\r\n\r\nData mining in the semi-automatic discovery of patterns, associations, changes, and anomalies is large data sets.  Traditionally, in a broad sense, statistics had focused on the assumption-driven analysis of data, while data mining has focused on the discovery analysis of data.  By discovery-driven, the proposers mean the semi-automatic search for interesting patterns and models.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop software tools, performance monitoring tools, network services and network protocols for distributed data analysis and data mining using emerging high performance networks.  The project director proposes to test the technologies that are developed using a global testbed being built called the Terabyte Challenge Testbed (TCTB).  Today over twenty scientists from seven institutions over three continents are working in the TCTB.  The project director proposes to substantially expand the TCTB with this proposal to demonstrate the practically of distributed data mining.\r\n",
