 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peskin\r\n9980069\r\n     Unsteady fluid flows driven by dynamic boundaries are among\r\nthe most difficult flows to simulate and visualize.  Whether\r\ndrawn from polymer rheology, microflight, or cardiac fluid\r\ndynamics, these problems involve structures on many length and\r\ntime scales, strong coupling between the fluid and a deformable\r\nboundary, and complex geometry.  The investigator and his\r\ncolleagues, taking the problems of insect flight and heart\r\nfunction as focal points for a multidisciplinary collaboration,\r\nseek a new paradigm for understanding boundary-fluid dynamics.\r\nThis new paradigm involves both numerical simulation and\r\nexperimental investigation, brought together through the emerging\r\ntechnology of virtual reality.  On the numerical side, they\r\ndevelop new adaptive and hierarchical numerical techniques, as\r\nwell as improve existing methods (immersed boundary and adaptive\r\ngrid), to enable interactive simulation experiments and steerable\r\ncomputation.  The experimental program focuses both on methods\r\nthat can be used to validate and complement the results of\r\nnumerical simulations, and on novel techniques for the study of\r\nunsteady flows with dynamic boundaries.  Computational and\r\nexperimental approaches are integrated within a virtual\r\nenvironment that enables a researcher to modify interactively the\r\nparameters and geometry of the simulated system, steer\r\ncomputational processes, flexibly visualize experimental data,\r\nand use experimental data to guide computation.\r\n     When unsteady three-dimensional flows interact with dynamic\r\nboundaries such as heart valves and insect wings, the resulting\r\nfluid dynamics defy easy representation and conventional\r\nanalysis.  The tight coupling between boundary and fluid, the\r\ndiffering and interacting length and time scales, and the\r\ncomplexity of turbulent motions make these problems a formidable\r\ntheoretical and computational challenge.  Breakthroughs in\r\nunderstanding this class of problems will enable important\r\nadvances in fields such as medicine, biology, aeronautics, and\r\nchemical engineering.  Achieving such breakthroughs is the goal of\r\na collaboration between researchers from NYU's Courant Institute\r\nof Mathematical Sciences (CIMS) and the University of Washington\r\n(UW), with combined expertise in mathematics and computation,\r\nexperimental laboratory investigation, and scientific\r\nvisualization.  Heart valve function and insect flight cannot be\r\nexplained by classical arguments based on steady flow.  Millions\r\nof years of evolution have produced shapes, feedback mechanisms,\r\nand boundary properties in response to the complexity of the\r\nboundary-fluid interaction.  A greater understanding of these\r\ninteractions between boundary and flow will open the door to new\r\ngenerations of artificial heart valves, small and highly\r\nefficient flying machines, and other devices carefully designed\r\nto interact with the complex but repeatable behaviors of boundary\r\ndominated fluid flows.  A key goal of this project is the\r\nintegration of experiment and computation in a virtual\r\nenvironment that facilitates the involvement of the human\r\ninvestigator.  The project strives to change the paradigm of\r\nresearch in this area.  A researcher should be able to modify the\r\nparameters and geometry of a simulated system while the\r\nsimulation is running; to steer, for a given simulated system,\r\nthe computational process itself; to use experimental data to\r\nguide the computation; and to process and interact with the\r\nexperimental data, while visualizing it in three dimensions as\r\nwell as over time.  While the focus is on the core studies of\r\ninsect flight and heart function, extrapolation from these core\r\nexamples should enable breakthroughs wherever fluids (including\r\ngases) interact with structures of complicated and possibly\r\ndynamic geometry.  This KDI project is supported by the Division\r\nof Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Integrative Biology and\r\nNeuroscience, and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.\r\n",
