 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brain depends for its normal function on the specialized functional connections called synapses between nerve cells.  These highly specialized structures have a great variety of sizes and ultrastructural features of their membranes, and can utilize a variety of molecules as neurotransmitters to carry information from one cell to another.  This project uses as a model system a particular giant synapse in a visual-motor pathway, between a giant fiber and a motor neuron that is found in the central nervous system of the fruitfly, Drosophila; this organism also has a very well understood genetic background.  Physiological, anatomical, and molecular tools, along with mutations and transgenic approaches, will be used to examine the molecular basis for the assembly of this giant synapse during development.  The particular interest is in a molecular signal within the giant fiber that is carried back up the fiber to the cell nucleus, to regulate the formation of synaptic specializations.  \r\n    Results will be important for developmental biology as well as neuroscience, and the project will also train undergraduate and graduate students in neuroscience.\r\n",
