 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on optimizing the processing techniques and scale up of the firm's microcellular LCP and PPS foams. Conventional processing techniques for rigid foams involve multiple steps and the blowing agent used is toxic, Some rigid foams give off hazardous gases during the post-processing steps.  In the Phase I research the firm developed a novel technique to process microcellular foams that does not use or release any hazardous chemicals/gases.  The foaming technique uses the principle of thermodynamic instability with inert gas as the foaming gas. We have foamed both the unfilled and filled liquid crystalline and semicrystalline polymers (LCPs & PPS) which have excellent strength and stiffness to weight ratio, good solvent resistance, barrier properties, and high temperature stability. \r\n     Low-density microcellular LCP & PPS foams are expected to have many commercial applications including sandwich structural materials for high speed aircraft, aerospace, outerspace vehicles, housing and support structures for rockets and propulsion components.  Conventional applications of LCPs and PPS include various electronic connectors, electronic and audiovisual devices.  They can be replaced by the proposed microcellular LCP and PPS foams with equivalent performance but much lighter in weight.  On the ground applications include ladders and bridges fabricated using these classes of microcellular foams that would be much lighter in weight than those currently available.\r\n",
