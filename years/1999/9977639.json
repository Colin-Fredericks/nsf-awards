 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this award for Major Research Instrumentation, the Principal Investigators will develop \"SuomiNet\", a university-based, real-time, national Global Positioning System (GPS) network for atmospheric research and education.  The proposed network, named to honor meteorological satellite pioneer Verner Suomi, will exploit the recently-shown ability of ground-based GPS receivers to make thousands of accurate upper and lower atmospheric measurements per day.  SuomiNet's goal is to use the demonstrated power of GPS for academic research and education, by making large amounts of spatially and temporally dense atmospheric data from broad and diverse regions widely available in real-time.  SuomiNet will use well established Internet Data Distribution (IDD) software and protocols to coordinate network sensors and distribute data in real-time.  \r\n\r\nSuomiNet data are relevant to several national and international programs including the U.S. Weather Research Program (USWRP) and the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX).  Phase delays induced in GPS signals by the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere can be measured with high precision simultaneously along a dozen or so GPS ray paths in the field of view.  These delays can be converted into integrated water vapor (if surface pressure data or estimates are available) and total electron content (TEC), along each GPS ray path.  The resulting continuous, accurate, all-weather, real-time GPS moisture data will help advance university research in mesoscale modeling and data assimilation, severe weather, precipitation, cloud dynamics, regional climate and hydrology.  These topics are central to the USWRP and GEWEX.  In addition, TEC and ionospheric scintillation data derived from GPS signal phase and amplitude will help universities address fundamental research topics including: (a) the processes that govern the spatial distribution of ionization, (b) the evolution of ionospheric irregularities and scintillation, (c) thermospheric dynamics and its coupling to the ionosphere, and (d) validation, testing and continued development of research models and numerical methods. \r\n\r\nFrom an educational perspective, SuomiNet will place state-of-the-art GPS equipment, data and processing methods in the hands of a large number of university departments, faculty, and students.  It is here, in the university setting, where the tremendous potential of GPS in atmospheric research  and education can be most effectively realized.  \r\n",
