 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  will build on the Phase I proof-of-concept demonstration of the use of PC-based facial animations to supplement verbal and sign language communications.  Seamless Solutions will develop software tools and animation libraries that will enable users to author and disseminate multimedia content based on this technology.  Specifically, the project will (1) expand the \"vocabulary\" of facial expression animations; (2) develop a Markup Language and authoring tools that enable educators and other potential users to include American Sign Language (ASL) and other visual/gastrula communication in their multimedia content; and (3) develop an Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG-4)  interface and integrate the animations with the Sign Language Recognition system being developed at the University of Pennsylvania. MPEG is the international committee developing the standard for streaming compositie synthetic and natural video, audio, and 3D graphics.  MPEG-4 is the fourth international communication standard which includes the standard for streaming 3-D virtual humans for applications such as virtual teleconferencing.)  This project will build on Seamless Solution's key Animation Engine technology that allows the interactive, real-time composition of synchronized voice, gesture, and facial expression animations. The research plan culminates with classroom evaluation of prototype applications developed by experienced educators of the deaf.\r\n     Facial animations, synchronized to voice, gesture, and signs, greatly enhance both the realism and the communications skills of computer-generated characters.  Seamless Solutions will develop applications of this technology not only for the Deaf, but also for interactive 3-D characters that can be embedded in educational software, in Web pages, and in virtual teleconference applications.\r\n\r\n",
