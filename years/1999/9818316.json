First, at the technology level, is the need for improved device characterization and\r\nmodeling.  Existing digital models sacrifice small-signal accuracy and require extensive curve-fitting in parameter extraction.  Our approach applies parameter techniques to account for reflections and interconnect parasitics.  In optimizing and developing devices in the deep submicron regime, the resolution of the HP 4156B is necessary.  Second, at the systems level, increasing mixed-signal functional integration is posing challenges to signal integrity, with noise contributions occurring in interconnects, the substrate, and within devices.  Detection of these picosecond transients requires equipment with a wide bandwidth and low noise.  The combination of the E2900A as a stimulus source and the 54616TC as a monitor will enable\r\nreal-time detection of signal degradation.  HP power supplies will provide extremely clean biasing for sub-1V device operation.  The Cascade Summit RF probe station is the foundation of the test environment, enabling on-wafer measurement of device characteristics and signal integrity, free from package parasitics.  The HP-IB interfaces will automate the measurement process for more efficient use of the equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
