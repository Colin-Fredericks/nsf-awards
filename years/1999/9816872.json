 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA typical bacterial genome encodes multiple multidrug transporters, membrane proteins which actively extrude structurally diverse toxic compounds from the bacterial cell. One of the most enigmatic questions associated with the phenomenon of multidrug transporters is whether they have evolved for chemoprotection, or for performing specific functions which are part of normal bacterial physiology. Frequently the natural function of a protein can be inferred from the regulatory mechanisms controlling its expression. Preliminary results indicate that the expression of two multidrug transporters of Bacillus subtilis, Bmr and BIt, is controlled by two alternative regulatory mechanisms: specific regulators BmrR and BItR, and the newly discovered global transcriptional activator Mta, which directly interacts with the promoters of both transporter genes. This project is investigating the physiological role of the Mta-mediated regulatory response.  This goal is being achieved by pursuing two largely independent specific aims. The first aim is to identify other genes, in addition to bmr and blt, which belong to the Mta regulon. The nature of these genes should indicate the function of Mta and, consequently, of multidrug transporters controlled by this protein. The search for additional Mta-regulated genes, which has already brought some interesting results, will be conducted mostly by genetic methods, using sequence pattern analysis, direct in vitro selection of B. subtilis DNA fragments binding to Mta, and screening transposon-generated libraries of lacZ transcriptional fusions for activation by Mta. The second aim is to identify the growth conditions under which Mta becomes activated and, eventually, to identify the inducer molecule(s) to which Mta responds. Two hypotheses will be tested here. According to the first hypothesis, the Mta inducer(s) are molecules produced by B. subtilis itself, as part of either a normal physiological process, or of a stress response. The activity of the Mta regulon under different physiological and stress conditions will be assessed by using a lacZ transcriptional fusion. To identify the inducer mutants of B. subtilis with a constitutively active Mta regulon will be selected and those mutations not linked to the mta gene itself will be mapped and characterized. Since such mutations, if selected, are likely to cause accumulation of the Mta inducer in the cell, the nature of the mutated genes will provide a strong clue as to the identity of the inducer. The second hypothesis postulates that the inducer of Mta is an exogenous toxin present in soil, the natural habitat of B. subtilis. Colonies of soil microorganisms and plant extracts will be screened for the ability to induce the Mta regulon in B. subtilis. If identified, these sources of the inducer will be used to purify it and characterize its chemical identity.  By understanding the nature of the Mta-mediated regulatory response it will possible to learn, for the first time, the physiological role played by complex systems of multidrug transporters in bacterial cells.\r\n",
