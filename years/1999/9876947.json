Methods of Littlewood-Paley theory and wavelets will be used to \r\nstudy weak singularities for the incompressible flows of an ideal fluid. The \r\nbasic nonstationary problem for the Euler equations will be investigated in \r\nfunction classes with, generally, essentially unbounded vorticity. He will \r\naddress the problem of linear vector transport by flows that are less than \r\nregular. These aspects of transport theory are directly applicable to \r\nquestions of existence and uniqueness for the Euler equations.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical theory of fluid motion is fundamental both for \r\napplications in meteorology, geophysics, astrophysics and within \r\nmathematics itself. Most of the flows in nature such as ocean currents, or \r\nhurricanes, or the motion of matter in a galaxy, are highly irregular. The \r\norigin and evolution of singular structures such as rapid oscillations of a \r\nflow are still not well understood. In addition to this, numerical modelling \r\nof irregular flows is limited by instabilities due to the small scale \r\nstructures constantly produced by the flow.  The PI will investigate two \r\nrelated aspects of this subject. First, the basic mathematical nature of the \r\nflows with singularities. Second, transport of quantities such as the \r\nmagnetic field by irregular flows in the solar photosphere.\r\n",
