 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcium oxalate crystal idioblasts are cells that are specialized for high capacity calcium sequestration.  They provide an excellent model for elucidating the biology of calcium transport and accumulation in plants.  To continue the characterization of specific components of the high capacity calcium sequestration system, the matrix protein (MP), a unique high capacity calcium binding protein specific to crystal idioblasts, will be characterized as to its role in the biophysical process of calcium oxalate precipitation.  Using both in vivo and in vitro methods, bacterial expressed cloned MP will be studied to further elucidate the role of this novel protein.  The effects of overexpression of the MP in E. coli cells will be studied in relation to the bacterium's ability to grow in the presence of elevated soluble calcium and changes in the level of endogenous calcium will be studied.  These studies should further the understanding of the physiological function of the MP in calcium sequestration.\r\n\r\nWhile there is considerable information on the biophysical properties of calcium channels in plant cells, advances in our understanding require that calcium channel protein components be isolated and cloned from plants.  Thus, the high capacity calcium accumulating cell type will be used to isolate cDNAs for a plant calcium channel(s) and allow the further study of the nature of the channel in the crystal idioblast system.  An antibody that recognizes a calcium channel-like protein in plants will be used for initial studies of localization and expression patterns in developing crystal idioblasts and idioblast fractions.\r\n",
