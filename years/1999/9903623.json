These processes can be particularly affected by environmental stress.  The salinity conditions in salt marsh ecosystems generate frequent occurrences of environmental stress and the dominant plant species in eastern US marshes, Spartina alterniflora, exhibits distinct patterns of growth forms that are correlated with changing salt conditions.   This proposal will test the notion that the changes in plant growth form in salt marshes are mediated by salinity induced shifts in bacterial N fixation,  a critical microbial process in the root zone.  The project will employ molecular biological techniques to examine the response of root-zone, N-fixing bacteria to key environmental stresses.  It will examine the generality of its findings by evaluating sites near the northern and southern limits of east coast S. alterniflora occurrence.  It will provide general insights into the responses of N-fixing bacterial assemblages to environmental stress.\r\n",
