The cost of portability, however, is program performance-JVM interpretation of a portable program is terribly slow.  Performance is greatly enhanced by the use of the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers.  However, every machine cycle spent by a JIT compiler in one less cycle available for program execution, thus limiting the quality and aggressiveness of both JIT analysis and optimization.  This project focuses on reducing the cost of JIT techniques-improving optimization-by annotating the bytecodes to convey more accurate and aggressive analysis and optimization information.  The research centers on five objectives:\r\n\r\n1. identification of a suitable of annotations,\r\n2. development of a Java compiler for producing annotations,\r\n3. development of an annotation-aware JIT compilers,\r\n4. integration into computer architecture and compiler design curricula,\r\n5. experimentation, evaluation and publication.\r\n\r\nThe results will have immediate scientific, industrial ad educational impact.  Annotations represent a new solution to the growing problem of delayed optimizations. Enable software and hardware firms to improve the performance of their Java-based systems, and yield a rich source of discussions/projects for students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
