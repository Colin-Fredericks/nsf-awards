The conference regularly draws about one thousand participants representing academia and industry.  The Antennas and Propagation Society of the IEEE along with several subgroups of URSI will meet in Orlando, Florida at the Renaissance Hotel in July 1999.\r\nEach year, the Antennas and Propagation Society promotes student participation in the conference through a number of mechanisms.  One of the most important is the Student Paper Competition at the conference.  This selective program brings the world's best students together in an integrated program in which they present their work to a technical audience including a group of judges.  The program helps develop the students' technical acumen as well as their communication and presentation skills.  It also helps introduce then to the international technical community and helps to build a community of students who will lead the next generation of antenna engineers.\r\nThe AP provides financial support of various forms including assistance in low cost housing, but does not reimburse travel expenses.  Travel support from NSF will ensure that the program is open to the widest range of interested applicants from U.S. Universities.\r\nThis proposal requests travel support to defray the travel expenses for young investigators whose papers have been selected for presentation at the Conference, but who lack funds and might not be able to attend without travel support.  It is proposed that the AP Technical Program Committee select those to receive the support.  The total amount requested is $14,000 on the basis of an average travel grant of $700 for 20 participants.\r\n***\r\n",
