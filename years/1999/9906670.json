 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot study will examine the impact of federally-funded research on the formation, survival, and growth of biotechnology firms over a 26-year period.  Specifically, the effects of the geographic distribution of science funding relative to the local area characteristics that affect the transfer of academic expertise to commercial activity will be investigated.  In addition, the role of NIH-funded researchers as founders, officers, and collaborators in biotechnology start-ups will be studied.  Methodologies will be developed that facilitate the linkage between NIH data and commercial applications.  Finally, a detailed analysis will be conducted of the field of science and commercial applications by institution, city, and state as recorded in the NIH Computerized Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) data base.  The research will enhance our understanding of technology transfer processes and of the diffusion of scientific information.  In addition, the results will be of significant interest to policy makers and to the business community.",
