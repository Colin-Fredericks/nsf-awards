 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ongoing study is focused on the Antennapedia complex (ANTC)-like portion of the Tribolium homeotic complex, which is involved in regulating developmental commitments in the head and thorax. The highly specialized nature of the Drosophila larval head and the phenotypes of mutations in genes regulating commitments in this part of the embryo suggest that the roles of these genes have been altered considerably with respect to ancestral insects. This conclusion is supported by the observation that all homeotic null phenotypes yet described in beetles differ from those of fly orthologs.  Two questions drive these studies: 1) What is the physical and functional organization of the Tribolium homeobox cluster? 2) What are the developmental roles of the homeobox cluster genes and other genes important to the regulation of anterior developmental fate and what can they tell us about the basis of morphological evolution. Proposed experiments represent an extension of on-going work. A physical map of the ANTC-like portion of the homeobox complex will be completed, a genetic screen using homeobox complex deficiencies will be completed with the goal of identifying all genes in the complex required zygotically for normal development and the regulation of the homeotic gene expression will be examined.\r\n\r\nStudies of Drosophila melanogaster have shown that embryonic developmental commitments along the anterior-posterior axis are controlled by homeotic selector genes in two clusters: the Antennapedia complex and the bithorax complex. The homeotic selector genes of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum are organized into a single complex representing the fly clusters in juxtaposition. Comparative molecular studies suggest that a single, albeit smaller complex arose very early in animal evolution, and that the genes in such complexes play important roles in regulating developmental commitments throughout the kingdom. Tribolium offers many advantages for comparative studies from which evolutionary inferences can be drawn. Beetles and flies show many morphological specialization's but these represent variations of a common body plan thus providing a context for understanding the relationship between genetic and morphological change.\r\n",
