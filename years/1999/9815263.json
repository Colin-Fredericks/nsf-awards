 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for laboratory preparation, diatom extraction and analysis from samples collected in the Dominion Range of East Antarctica.  The presence of marine fossil diatoms in glacial deposits of the Sirius Group in the Transantarctic Mountains has led to considerable discussion regarding their origin and significance.  Eolian transport (both local and long distance), sub-glacial transport from marine deposits, and atmospheric transport from the deep-sea as meteorite ejecta are all sources of diatoms which have. been described in the literature.  Assemblage composition, size, age, and other features can be used to separate these different sources.  Samples which yielded a wealth of stratigraphic and paleontologic information were collected at Oliver Bluffs.  This material is part of the Meyer Desert Formation, which is thought to be one of the most significant deposits of the Sirius Group.  Several tests will be performed to examine the occurrence of diatoms (which are known to occur) in these strata and in surface deposits across landscapes of varying age.  This project will verify the presence of diatoms and will examine their distribution along several profiles from 1-meter deep excavations in a vertical outcrop.  This study should help to answer questions about the source of the diatoms and the mechanisms by which they were transported",
