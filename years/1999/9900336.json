Since 1992, GCLs have been used\r\nwidely in hydraulic containment applications because of their relatively\r\nlow cost and very low hydraulic conductivity to water (k 10E-8 cm/s).\r\nHowever, most applications using GCLs involve the containment of chemical\r\nsolutions that may be incompatible with the bentonite portion of the GCLs,\r\nand the results of most hydraulic conductivity tests on GCLs are performed\r\nover relatively short test durations (e.g., 6 mos.). As a result, the\r\nprimary objective of this study, a joint effort between Colorado State\r\nUniversity (CSU) and the University of Wisconsin at Madison (UWM), is to\r\nevaluate the long-term performance of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs)\r\npermeated with aqueous inorganic solutions over test durations ranging from\r\n6 mos. to 3 yrs. Physical, hydraulic, and mechanical properties of the GCLs\r\nboth before and after exposure to permeation with distilled water and salt\r\nsolutions will be determined. The research will include tests to evaluate\r\nthe long-term hydraulic conductivity, swell, shear strength, and diffusion\r\nproperties of GCLs. In addition, an exchange program between CSU and UWM\r\nwill be established based for both educational and research dissemination\r\npurposes. The results of this study will advance our understanding of the\r\nlong-term behavior of GCLs, and should impact the design of waste\r\ncontainment systems involving GCLs.",
