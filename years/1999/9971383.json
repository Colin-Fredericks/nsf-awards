 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for \"Free boundary problems in volatile multi-fluid flows\" by\r\nB. S. Tilley\r\n\r\nThis proposal centers on the fundamental description of nonparallel\r\naxisymmetric countercurrent core-annular flow regimes. The mathematical\r\nmethods of solution consist of a systematic asymptotic reduction of the\r\ncontinuity, Navier-Stokes, and energy equations in each fluid to a\r\nsimpler evolution equation that describes the interfacial evolution\r\nwhen the radius of the tube is much smaller than the interfacial\r\nvariation along the tube's axis.  This equation will contain the\r\nphysical effects of viscosity and density stratification, axial and\r\nazimuthal components of surface forces, shear, inertia, buoyancy,\r\nthermocapillarity, volatility, latent heat and thermal transport.  In\r\nthe isothermal situation, parallel flow is possible, conditions under\r\nwhich the parallel flow solution can be unstable to a large-amplitude\r\nsolitary wave will be considered.  This wave is seen in experiment.\r\nThe remainder of the proposal centers on nonparallel flows, since the\r\nspatially varying solutions in the volatile case cannot be parallel,\r\nand the isothermal problem experimentally is susceptible to\r\ninstabilities from inlet and outlet disturbances.  The flow patterns\r\nthat are of interest include that hanging annular film, in which\r\ngravity is balanced by the presence of an adverse shear in the core\r\nfluid, an annular drop, and slug formation.  Stability will be\r\ninvestigated through direct numerical simulation of the evolution\r\nequation under conditions similar to those found in experiment.\r\n\r\nIn a variety of engineering applications, the transfer of heat is the\r\nlimiting factor of the functionality of the entire engineering system,\r\nsuch as electrical generators, electronic equipment cooling arrays,\r\nboiler tubes, and liquid-cooled turbine blades.  The systems used to\r\ntransport heat away from the underlying application use multiple fluid\r\nlayers to increase the rate of heat transport.  These fluid systems are\r\nprone to hydrodynamic instabilities, which can greatly reduce the\r\nheat-transport properties, leading to a breakdown in the entire\r\napplication.  A theoretical and experimental understanding of these\r\ninstabilities is critical to enhancements in design.  The proposed\r\nresearch considers a mathematical model of a common fluid arrangement\r\nin these heat-transfer systems as a paradigm for a better understanding\r\nof the dominant instability mechanism.  Once this mechanism is well\r\nunderstood, it will be possible to enhance the performance of the\r\nunderlying application.  Further applications are seen in the medical\r\nfield, with the understanding of instabilities of the mucus covering of\r\nthe airways in the lungs.  Understanding under what physical conditions\r\nthese instabilities occur can eventually lead to better medical\r\ntreatments of some respiratory ailments.\r\n\r\n",
