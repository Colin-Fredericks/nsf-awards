Olson\r\nThe University of Texas at Austin\r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed study is to develop methodology for predicting\r\nstrength and failure of weakly cemented sand and gravel from small-strain\r\nstiffness as measured with the velocity of stress waves. The project will be\r\nespecially concerned with weakly cemented sand and gravel, and phenomena such\r\nas soil liquefaction in earthquakes and sand production in petroleum wells,\r\nwhere correlation of wave velocities to strength would be useful. The objective\r\nwill be approached through the development of an improved, fundamental\r\nunderstanding of how particle cementation can be determined from wave\r\nvelocities and static moduli, and how this characterization of cement can be\r\nrelated to engineering behavior such as aggregate strength, liquefaction\r\npotential, and sand production.  A concurrent numerical and experimental\r\ninvestigation is planned. Experiments on cylindrical test specimens will be\r\nconducted in a triaxial test apparatus, while the numerical work will involve\r\nDiscrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. Experimental data permit immediate\r\ncalibration and verification of analytic results, while numerical simulations\r\ncan be helpful in identifying underlying mechanisms responsible for observed\r\nbehavior and in designing useful laboratory tests. DEM simulations will be used\r\nto compute bulk material strength and elastic wave velocities as a function of\r\nparticle size distributions, intergranular cement and material porosity. \r\nBehavior observed from these simulations will be used to devise appropriate\r\nexperimental tests and test conditions that are most likely to produce\r\nmeaningful data.  Samples for experimental testing will include naturally\r\noccurring granular material of varying degrees of cementation and strength, as\r\nwell as artificially created samples.  \r\n",
