 "awd_abstract_narration": "9816166\r\nFrechet\r\nThe last decade has seen an explosion in research, both pure and applied, exphasizing molecular architecture, supramolecular chemistry, and chemistry at the nanometer scale.  Dendrimers and other dendritic molecules such as linear-dendritic hybrids and hyperbranched polymers have been major contributors to this surge of activity spanning several fields including chemistry, materials science, physics, medicine, and mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis project is focused on the discovery and development of versatile families of dendritic polymers, the establishment of reliable synthetic methods and procedures for their preparation, and their early characterization.  One of its aims is to stimulate the development of novel applications by providing access to versatile  structures and contributing to a better fundamental understanding of these unique molecules and their behavior.                                                                                                                                                         %%%                                                                                                                                                                        Synthetic targets include both simplified and high yielding approaches to dendritic molecules, the use of more accessible starting materials, as well as the design and preparation of more complex targets for which structure defines function.  For example, the exploration of a versatile new family of hydrolytically stable dendrimers with reactive end-groups is proposed.  These dendrimers, obtained in high yield processes from simple starting materials, will complement the limited array of dendrimer families in widespread use today. Their potential applications span a broad spectrum from targeted drug delivery, to sensors, molecular \"machines\", micellar catalysts, nanoscale components, or biological mimics.  Hyperbranched polymers, obtained through polymerization processes rather than repetitive stepwise syntheses, are candidates for use in industrial additives, improved plastics, coatings, or adhesives.  Finally, well-defined linear hybrid-dendritic structures should prove useful as building blocks in supramolecular chemistry, surface active agents, micellar catalysts, adsorbents, etc.  The characterization and availability of these novel globular molecules will also contribute greatly to our understanding of structure-property relationships.",
