 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support research on a challenging class of mathematical \r\nproblems in the field of nonlinear homogenization. Specifically, the project \r\nis concerned with the study of the effective or \"homogenized\" behavior of \r\nfinite elastic composites such as elastic foams or particle-reinforced rubber. \r\nThese are heterogeneous material systems that are characterized by nonlinear\r\nand in fact nonconvex local energy functions. The key idea is to make use of \r\navailable homogenization estimates for suitably chosen \"linear comparison \r\ncomposites\" to generate corresponding estimates for the nonlinear composites. \r\nThis is an idea that has been pioneered with success by the PI in the \r\ncontext of nonlinear problems with convex energy functions \r\n(e.g., plasticity, nonlinear conductivity, etc.). By suitably enlarging the \r\nclass of \"trial\" linear comparison media, a generalized version of the method \r\nwill be developed that will be suitable for nonconvex problems.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is thus to develop mathematical methods for \r\nestimating the macroscopic behavior of nonlinear elastic composite materials \r\nthat are subjected to finite deformations. The work will be directly relevant to a\r\nrange of technologically important material systems, from the commonplace,\r\nsuch as elastomeric foams, to the more sophisticated, such as shape-memory\r\nalloys. In particular, the work will focus on models for particle-reinforced elastomers \r\n(e.g., carbon-black filled rubbers) and porous elastic solids (e.g., polymeric foams).\r\nAs a result, effective estimates for the response of such materials will be produced\r\nthat are easy to use by the engineering community and that can be compared to \r\nexperimental studies.\r\n\r\n",
