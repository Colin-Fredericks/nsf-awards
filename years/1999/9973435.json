 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main activity of this POWRE award is to conduct a feasibility study of surveying a rare, diverse, and rapidly growing minority population severely underrepresented in the curriculum of American politics and government.  A major reason for the absence of data is the difficulty in systematically surveying a small, bicoastally-distributed, and ethnically and linguistically diverse population.  However, the regionally-concentrated and highly metropolitan residential pattern of the population also permits opportunity to selectively sample Asian Americans from localities where they are most likely to congregate.  Telephone households in the top metropolitan areas of Asian populations in the United States will be sampled using a multi-frame approach consisting of unrestricted random-digit dialing Asian exchange density, random-digit dialing at targeted Asian exchange density, and listed-surname frames.  A total of 1,000 adult Asians belonging to the six largest Asian ethnic groups and residing in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Honolulu, and Chicago will be interviewed by phone, with 200 completed interviews from each of the five locations.        \r\n\r\nAn initiative to gather primary data on the political attitudes and behavior of Asian Americans is direly needed to bridge the research and data gaps in the studying of American political behavior and the state of the U.S. democracy as a multicultural society.  Although large-scale, nationally representative public opinion data have been collected specifically from the African and Hispanic American population, no such data exist for the studying of the political opinion of the nation's third largest and fastest growing minority population.  Without such data, it is difficult to gauge the shape of the Asian American political community at the national level.  Neither is it possible to advance our understanding of the sources of uneven incorporation of this minority population into the U.S. economic and political systems.  Information gathered from this initiative would represent a significant expansion in hypothesis testing concerning race and political behavior as well as of research coverage to geographic locations and American ethnic groups neglected in the extant literature.  \r\n\r\nThis research is an integral part of the investigator's career plans and goals to advance the scholarship, visibility, and influence of Asian Americans--particularly Asian immigrant women--in Political Science and Ethnic Studies.  Data and experience gained from this pilot study will be evaluated and used to secure research partnership and major foundation support for the conducting of a larger and more comprehensive multiracial survey to address the nation's issues of inequality in social and political participation and incorporation.  This ultimately will contribute to the larger goal of promoting equal opportunities in social and political participation regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and nativity through rigorous social science research and cross-disciplinary intellectual exchange.  In these ways, an award from POWRE is critical not only to the advancement of the investigator's career at this juncture, but to the expansion of knowledge and understanding about Asian Americans as a political community and about America as a multicultural democracy.\r\n",
