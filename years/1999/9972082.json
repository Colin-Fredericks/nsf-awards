 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal focuses on developing statistical methods and related theory \r\nfor fast functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to sharply improve \r\nthe time-resolution of present techniques.  Our objective is to improve the \r\ntime-resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging by sampling only a \r\nsmall fraction of the Fourier transform of the spin density, and using a \r\nwavelet filter to approximately obtain, not the usual susceptibility map, \r\nbut instead an integral, representing the total activity, of the difference \r\nin susceptibility between task and pre-task, over a prespecified region of \r\ninterest in the brain at successive time-points.  This space/time trade-off \r\nthus allows us to obtain, at high time-resolution, the total activity in a \r\nspecified region of the brain, believed to process the specific stimulus/task, \r\nto learn or verify where the brain function takes place.  An example of the \r\nuse of the technique is to learn where in the brain the \"rolodex\" of memory \r\nis located whereby one recognizes a familiar face in a fraction of a second.  \r\nTo try to find where the rolodex is located by a method which requires more \r\nthan a second is a doubtful project; better time-resolution is required (but \r\nhigh spatial resolution is not). Although some researchers claim faster\r\nmeasurement capabilities they sacrifice signal/noise.\r\n\r\nStatistical methods and related theory will be developed to sharply improve \r\ntime-resolution for the technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  Our objective is to improve the time-resolution of fMRI by acquiring data from only a small fraction of the MRI sampling space, to approximately obtain the total activity of the difference in susceptibility between task and pre-task, over a prespecified region of interest in the brain at successive time-points.  For a typical region of the brain, say describing the hippocampus, believed to be involved in memory, our optimal choice of the sampling region should give a ten fold speed-up compared to the usual method of sampling. An example of the use of the technique is to learn where in the brain the \"rolodex\" of memory is located whereby one recognizes a familiar face in a fraction of a second.  This fast fMRI is expected to have profound and far-reaching consequences in the understanding of brain function, a problem of central scientific interest at the present time.",
