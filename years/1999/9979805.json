 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores the effectiveness of teacher education and learning in an inquiry-based learning program, Schools for Thought (SFT).  The project will produce three interrelated modules of materials  - each set containing case examples and exemplars, reflections on cases, and scoring guides anchored with examples of student work. CD-Rom and Web formats are used for the presentation of the material. In the first phase of the project, materials will be developed by experienced SFT teachers interacting with the PI. This will result in prototype teaching materials, scoring guides, curricula, and other supports for guiding less experienced SFT teachers in a process of inquiry into their own teaching. The teacher-cognitive scientist interactions will be examined to analyze differences in what teachers and cognitive scientists find most valuable when reflecting on learning programs based on cognitive principles.  The St. Louis public schools will provide a test bed for this inquiry-based curriculum.",
