Their aim is to\r\nunderstand how three key factors (species interactions,\r\nenvironmental heterogeneity, and demographic stochasticity)\r\naffect the invasion process.  The models take the form of systems\r\nof nonlinear integrodifference equations.  They test their models\r\nwith data from a nascent, biologically simple invasion: the\r\nspread of lupine and its caterpillar herbivore into the Pumice\r\nPlains region of Mount St. Helens following its 1980 eruption.\r\n     Invasions by exotic species -- species like zebra mussels,\r\ngypsy moths, and purple loosestrife -- are occurring more\r\nfrequently than ever before.  In one recent year, 456 million\r\nexotic plants were imported into the United States.  The\r\nbiological and economic consequences of these invasions can be\r\ndramatic; estimates of the damage done to agricultural crops by\r\nexotic species run in the billions of dollars.  A key to\r\ncontrolling the spread of exotic species is a scientific\r\nunderstanding of the factors that determine how fast they spread\r\nacross the landscape.  One way to obtain this understanding is\r\nthrough the use of mathematical models of the invasion process.\r\nThe investigators construct and analyze invasion models that\r\nincorporate an important biological reality that has often been\r\nmissing in other studies: the fact that invaders interact both\r\nwith their prey and often with simultaneously introduced\r\npredators and competitors.  They test the predictions of their\r\nmodels with data from actual biological invasions that occurred\r\nin the wake of the eruption of Mount St. Helens.  The insight\r\nthey gain from these studies will help environmental managers\r\ndeal more effectively with invading nonnative pest species.\r\nThe project is supported by the programs of Applied Mathematics\r\nand of Computational Mathematics and the Office of\r\nMultidisciplinary Activities in MPS and by the programs of\r\nPopulation Biology and of Ecology in BIO.\r\n",
