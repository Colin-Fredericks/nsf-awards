This workshop will discuss various delivery techniques available and how to implement them into power electronics sources.  The workshop will also focus on detailed course offerings, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. and explores the current industry needs for power electronics engineers.  This workshop will also address the issues of hardware laboratory  and computer simulation support accompanying course instructions.  Among its expected final recommendations is the presentation of comprehensive power electronics curricula for both undergraduate and graduate level courses and to include specific detailed course and laboratory contents.  The workshop will provide the opportunity to make use of the collective experiences of many experts in the field and to reach a consensus on global electronics curricula.  \r\n\r\n",
