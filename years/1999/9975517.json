The work is an extension of previous accomplishment by the PI under a NSF CAREER award (PHY-9502935).  The PI has demonstrated an EO cavity-dumped laser system that has produced 200nJ of energy in 20 fsec at 1 KHz repetition rate, which is twice the energy of the state-of-the-art acuosto-optic (AO) cavity-dumped laser system.  The advantage of the EO cavity-dumping over that of AO is that the latter suffers instability at high powers due to the nonlinear process of the AO crystal.  The PI predicted that the theoretical maximum energy of an EO cavity dumped laser system is still 50 times what has been demonstrated, and that a repetition rate as high as 10 MHz is possible.  This proposal is to improve the original design and to achieve even higher energy of the laser system than he has demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
