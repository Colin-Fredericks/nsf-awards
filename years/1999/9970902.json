 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with a number of inference problems in\r\nnonparametric regression analysis.  Two of the problems being considered\r\ninvolve the use of nonparametric smoothing methodology to assess the\r\nlack-of-fit of certain types of parametric models.  The development of such\r\nlack-of-fit tests has been an active research area for about the last 10\r\nyears.   However, effective methods for obtaining analytic assessments of\r\nthe relative performance of such tests has not, as yet, been determined.\r\nOne of the goals of this project is derivation of a framework for studying\r\nthe relative asymptotic efficiency of nonparametric smoothing based tests\r\nusing an asymptotic intermediate efficiency approach that makes it possible\r\nto extend the concept of asymptotic efficiency into the nonparametric, or\r\ninfinite dimensional, alternative setting.  The other lack-of-fit testing\r\nproblem being studied concerns nonlinear parametric regression models.\r\nThis problem is of particular interest since it provides a case where, in\r\nsome instances, the usual smoothing parameter asymptotics obtain under the\r\nnull model and thereby allow for the development of asymptotically\r\ndistribution free test statistics.  Another collection of problems under\r\nconsideration is concerned with the derivation of suitable variance\r\nestimators and associated heteroscedasticity diagnostics in the context of\r\npartially linear models.  Variance estimators are needed here for a number\r\nof reasons which include their use in testing hypotheses about the\r\nparametric components (e.g., treatment effects) of the model.  A final\r\nclass of problems under investigation concerns computational methods for\r\nboundary correcting smoothing spline estimators.  These problems have\r\nimplications and applications to the problem of interval estimation in\r\nnonparametric regression that are also being explored.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common approaches to statistical analysis involves the\r\nfitting of data by a parametric model.  Such models are frequently\r\ndeveloped through consideration of the physical nature of a problem under\r\nstudy which may suggest a mathematical relationship or model for the data.\r\nFor example, in Biology there are mathematical models that have been\r\nproposed for relating growth  (of  humans, animals, etc.) to age, while in\r\nMeteorology there are mathematical models deriving from physics that\r\nattempt to predict the development of storms and weather patterns.  This\r\nproject is concerned, in part, with the study and development of various\r\nstatistical methods for assessing the validity of parametric models.  The\r\nmethods being considered use flexible data fitting techniques known as\r\nnonparametric smoothers to evaluate and compare fits obtained from a\r\nproposed or postulated parametric model.  Those smoothes can be used to\r\nobtain statistical tests that can, in turn, be used to assess the accuracy\r\nof a model in question.  This is particularly important because an\r\nincorrectly specified model can have potentially dangerous consequences in\r\nthat it can produce incorrect conclusions and predictions about the process\r\nunder study.  In addition to the development of new testing methods,\r\ntechniques are being developed for the comparison of different tests to\r\ndetermine which type of test performs the best in different situations that\r\nmight be encountered in practice.  Other problems under study include the\r\ndevelopment of computationally efficient methods for computing certain\r\ntypes of data smoothers and methods for conducting statistical inference\r\nwhen it may not be possible to completely specify a parametric model for a\r\nset of data.  The latter problem arises frequently in practice where it may\r\nbe reasonable to assume a particular parametric form for a portion of the\r\nmodel corresponding, for example, to presence or absence of cancer in a\r\nsubject, but there is no obvious choice for a parametric model involving\r\nother influential variables, such as the time of a subject's evaluations.",
