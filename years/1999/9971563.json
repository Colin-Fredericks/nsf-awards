In\r\n\r\nparticular, he proposes to extend his present methods for finding\r\n\r\ncomplete minimal surfaces to periodic minimal surfaces, then\r\n\r\nproving their embeddedness via a combination of\r\n\r\nTeichmuller-theoretic and minimal surface methods, and then\r\n\r\nfinally studying limits of families of these surfaces as their\r\n\r\ngenus increases. He also proposes to classify the minimal maps of\r\n\r\nsurfaces into a particular building associated to convex\r\n\r\nprojective structures on Riemann surfaces (in order to identify a\r\n\r\ngeometrically natural compactification of the space of discrete\r\n\r\nfaithful representations of a surface group into the Lie group of\r\n\r\nconvex projective transformations).  Finally, he proposes to use\r\n\r\nharmonic maps to singular spaces (both with mild singularities\r\n\r\nand more serious singularities, like real trees) to study bending\r\n\r\nmeasure coordinates on the Bers slice of Quasifuchsian space, and\r\n\r\nharmonic maps between hyperbolic spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fundamental questions underlying all of this are, \"What are\r\n\r\nthe possible shapes of surfaces we might encounter?\", and \"What\r\n\r\nshapes arise if we require the surfaces to be efficient users of\r\n\r\nmaterial, in some sense?\"  There are, of course, many ways of\r\n\r\ninterpreting the words \"shape\" and \"efficient\", and different\r\n\r\napplications of the proposed research would most likely involve\r\n\r\ndifferent interpretations of those words. This research project\r\n\r\nis an attempt to advance our understanding of the possibilities\r\n\r\nfor the shapes of soap films (which efficiently use material --\r\n\r\nsome applications of this theory by others to material science is\r\n\r\nin its embryonic stage) and for three other types of shapes. We\r\n\r\nalso study the possible ways of transforming one surface into\r\n\r\nanother in an energetically efficient way. It turns out that all\r\n\r\nthese different problems are deeply interrelated, so advances in\r\n\r\none area often lead to advances in others.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
