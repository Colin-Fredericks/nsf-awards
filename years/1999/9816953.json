The student will test the hypothesis that that the transition from rigid state control to a more open market society necessarily involves a cultural transformation of concepts of labor and leisure, and a more capitalistic relation between people and commodities.  The focus of this case study will be Cuba's only commercial radio station, Radio Taino.  Using methods of participant observation, oral histories and extensive interviews with radio personnel and government administrators the student will focus on the dissemination of a shared popular culture to create a national identity; the promotion of a particular form of music (salsa, once banned by the government and  now promoted as uniquely Cuban); and the introduction of commercial advertisements (banned since 1959) in radio programming.  The project will shed light on how the Cuban government is promoting popular music styles and consumer products in order to pave the way for a transformation of Cuban society.  In addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important region of the world. \r\n\r\n",
