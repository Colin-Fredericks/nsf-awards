 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the failure of current prevention programs to stem the tide of AIDS in Africa, there is a compelling case for devising more complex and integrated inter-disciplinary paradigms to guide AIDS prevention efforts in Africa. It is within this context and the on-going debates on how best to deal with the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa that this workshop is organized. The objective is to examine the past, understand the present, and chart the future of the AIDS pandemic in Africa. A small group of researchers intimately familiar with the topic of AIDS/HIV in Africa will be involved in the workshop. The group will exchange information about contemporary, on-going research and will identify future research essential to knowledge advancement in dealing with the AIDS pandemic. The workshop will formulate a research agenda, devise a dissemination plan to the broader community of concerned academics, and, eventually write a state-of-the-art grant proposal leading to new and better research. This activity is significant in that it will bring together streams of analysis, research and debate that remain largely separated from each other because of a reluctance to cross disciplinary boundaries.  The University of Illinois Press will publish proceedings of the workshop in book format.",
