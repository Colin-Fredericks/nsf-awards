 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this new award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the work of Dr. Watson J. Lees in the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University.   The objective of the research is to understand and develop catalyst systems, consisting of mixtures of small thiols and disulfides, which are capable of refolding proteins with the formation of new disulfide (S-S) linkages, in a manner analogous to the natural enzyme Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI).   The refolding process has important practical implications, since the market for therapeutic proteins manufactured this way is over $600 million per year.   Examples of proteins made this way include bovine growth harmone, tissue plasminogen activator, interleukin-2, and insulin.\r\n\r\nThe strategy is to use mixtures of aromatic disulfides and thiols as redox buffers.   The thiols have low pKas and are more nucleophilic than aliphatic thiols of similar acidity.   Two aromatic thiols will be connected by a linker of varying length, permitting them to be oxidized to a disulfide with a  high reduction potential, similar to that observed in PDI.   Polyethylene glycol or bovine serum albumin will then be attached to provide protein binding capability to the artificial enzyme so formed.   Variables to be explored will include both the linker length and the effects of substituents on the aromatic rings.",
