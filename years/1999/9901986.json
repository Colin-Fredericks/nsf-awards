 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis research focuses on the development, analysis and implementation of fast and memory-efficient algorithms \r\nfor solving several matrix computation problems arising from information retrieval and data mining.  The singular value decomposition (SVD) of large and/or sparse matrices plays an essential role in this research: it is used, on the one hand, for dimension reduction to achieve high algorithmic efficiency, and on the other for noise reduction to improve retrieval accuracy.  The emphasis is on exploring the intrinsic structures of the matrices arising from those applications to develop fast algorithms for their SVD computation. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the goals of this research are 1) the development of theoretical foundation for latent semantic indexing (LSI) and related spectral analytical methods for information retrieval, hypertext link analysis and data mining; \r\n2) the development and implementation of high performance algorithms for partial SVD and sparse low-rank approximation computation that can scale to very large text corpora and databases.\r\nA subspace-based statistical model has been previously developed to represent the \r\nrelations between terms and latent concepts.  This model has led to a \"low-rank-plus-shift\" structure that is approximately satisfied by the cross-product of the term-document matrices. \r\nThis structure gives rise to a more accurate updating scheme for LSI and it also leads to a highly parallel divide-and-conquer method for computing the partial SVD of large sparse term-document matrices. \r\nThis project will 1)  further develop our subspace-based model and gain deeper understanding of the \r\neffectiveness of partial SVD and their sparse variations in text retrieval, link analysis and data mining \r\napplications; 2) further explore the low-rank-plus-shift structures of the term-document matrices and link matrices \r\nto develop fast and memory-efficient numerical algorithms for the computation of their partial SVD in linear time; \r\n3) explore other efficient heuristics for finding dense bipartite subgraphs used in Web link analysis and data mining applications; and 4) test the algorithms on text corpora generated from WWW and large commercial databases.\r\n\r\nNo computation of SVD on the order of several million has been attempted before, and LSI, data mining applications and link analysis for WWW provides a perfect platform to investigate algorithmic issues and parallel implementation issues for large-scale computation.  This research attempts to integrate theoretical investigation based on statistics and matrix perturbation theory, algorithmic development using computational linear algebra methodologies, and experimentation on real-world text corpora and large datasets obtained from WWW search engines and large commercial databases. \r\n",
