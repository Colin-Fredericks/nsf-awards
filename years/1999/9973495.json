 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been identified as an essential component in a range of mental and physical processes, including higher level cognition, emotional response to stress, incentive motivation and motor behavior. Diverse structural and functional relationships are enabled by extensive neural connections linking the PFC to other heavily inputted brain regions. For this proposal, the dynamic association between the PFC and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is of particular interest.  As projection terminal regions, the PFC and the NAcc  share a common point of origin in subcortical dopaminergic cell bodies.  It has been shown that manipulation of dopamine neurotransmission in the PFC can alter  dopamine activity in the NAcc. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate changes in NAcc dopamine as the result of PFC dopamine manipulations.  After intra-PFC injections of  dopamine agonists or antagonists, the transsynaptic effects of these manipulations will be assessed by analyzing brain dialysate samples from the NAcc through the use of in vivo microdialysis coupled with electrochemical detection.\r\n     It has been suggested that increased dopamine neurotransmission provides neural emphasis to biologically relevant stimuli, thus increasing the impact of the stimuli upon the organism.  If dopamine activity reflects relative importance of neural information, this study will show how information processing priorities and output can be affected transsynaptically.  It has been suggested that brain region interactions of this type occur routinely as normal brain homeostatic responses to drug use or disease processes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
