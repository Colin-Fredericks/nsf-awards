 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to improve course content and student learning in physics classes. Implementation will allow completion of an upgrade to laboratory and lecture demonstration equipment for use in all introductory physics and physical science classes, for both science majors and general education classes.\r\n\r\nThe equipment requested is computer based which will allow implementation of the most current data collection and analysis techniques. The new laboratory equipment will provide quick, graphical, real time feedback that makes possible study of a wider variety of experiences than were previously possible, while at the same time enhancing quantitative capabilities. This equipment is also necessary to allow community college students to start learning to use equipment and techniques which have become standard in universities and industry.\r\n\r\nThis project will encourage students to continue their study of science by providing the tools to master what many often find difficult concepts in science. It will help prepare both the science/engineering major and the non-science majors to increase their scientific literacy and to be better prepared for critical science related decisions in their future professional or personal lives, as science and technology affect more areas of daily living.\r\n",
