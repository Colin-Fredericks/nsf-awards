The idea of carrying out tasks using large coordinated systems of MEMS units motivates the development of automated, algorithmic methods for designing and controlling these groups of devices.  The research focuses on algorithms and systems that enable MEMS to perform distributed manipulation tasks, taking on the challenge of design, control, and programming of massively-parallel arrays of microactuators.\r\n\r\nNew algorithms and MEMS for massively parallel distributed manipulation are being developed.  This entails the design, fabrication, and control of new MEMS devices, together with the design, construction, and programming of new control systems, algorithms, and software for task-level manipulation.  Algorithms and systems are being developed for part orientation, singulation, sorting, and posing.  The primary focus of this research is to extend the theory of programmable vector fields to exploit sensor feedback, and investigate closed loop control algorithms, on-line algorithms, and distributed, local control of ciliary arrays.  A current quasi-static vector field model is being extended to a full dynamic model.  The effect of control uncertainty and error to develop motion planning paradigms that are effective under uncertainty are also being investigated.  This should result in a more realistic and robust geometric theory of planning and manipulation, which is being tested by implementing algorithms on physical MEMS array devices.  Finally, the application of massively-parallel micro-robotic systems to biomedical systems and human augmentation is being explored.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
