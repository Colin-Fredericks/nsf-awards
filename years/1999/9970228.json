Symmetrization methods will \r\nbe employed.\r\n  (b) That steady states of \"thin fluid film\" type partial differential \r\nequations can be linearly stable in certain situations, but in other \r\nsituations can be unstable and tend to film pinch-off or blow-up. Trial \r\nfunction and differential inequality techniques will be used to prove \r\nthe in/stability results.\r\n  (c) That the first moment of an equilibrium unit charge distribution \r\nin the plane, about its electrostatic centroid, is maximal for a line \r\nsegment. A \"double *-function\" will be developed to attack this problem.\r\nThe methods to be applied to these problems are mathematical, though each \r\nproblem has physical meaning.\r\n\r\n     Problems of vibration, fluids and charges have been studied for \r\nhundreds of years.  Today they remain challenging and important, as \r\nscientists grapple with new and old materials on extreme scales and under \r\nextreme conditions.  The history of 20th century science shows, though, \r\nthat progress on practical problems often depends on the methods and \r\ninsights developed in basic research. The problems addressed in this \r\nproposal have been chosen for their potential to provide such insights. For \r\nexample, the conjectured answers to problems (a) and (c) are \"obvious\" - the \r\npuzzle (and challenge) is that no-one can explain logically why these \r\nanswers are correct. Finding such a logical explanation is sure to profitably \r\nenhance our understanding of and capabilities with problems of vibration \r\nand charge distribution. More specifically, the first problem in the proposal \r\ndeals with choosing the shape of a thin vibrating rigid plate so as to \r\nminimize the lowest resonant frequency. Experiments performed over \r\n100 years ago suggest the circular plate is the one with lowest frequency, \r\nbut there is still no theoretical explanation for this. The next problem \r\nconcerns the equations that model thin lubricating films of viscous oils. \r\nThese equations are nonlinear, meaning familiar superposition principles \r\n(adding two solutions to get another solution) do not apply. Nonlinear \r\nproblems are at the forefront of mathematical analysis, and this research \r\naims to understand how it is that nonlinear effects create stability, \r\ninstability and pinch-off in thin fluid film equations. The third problem \r\nconsidered in the proposal is a simply-stated but still-unsolved problem \r\narising from the theory of electrostatics, to do with how electrons arrange \r\nthemselves on a conductor under their mutual repulsion.\r\n",
