The first mass produced commodities to reach local markets are often packaged and processed foods, which carry with them a high social standing as they represent the \"modern\" urban centers.  This dissertation research proposal by an anthropology student from the University of Michigan will study the process of household food selection in two fishing communities of Northeastern Brazil, one whose economy is stagnant and another which is developing a tourist economy. The student will test hypotheses about social status and food beliefs and preferences and investigate the cultural associations and values of new foods through ethnographic as well as survey methods.  The new knowledge form this study will advance our understanding of how food consumption varies with economic status, an how food consumption is used by traditional communities to create and uphold social and economic divisions among residents. In addition the research will contribute to the training of a young social scientist and advance our knowledge about this important region of the world. \r\n\r\n",
