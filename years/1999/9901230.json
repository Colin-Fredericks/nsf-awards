The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide support for a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Scott Crass to work with Dr. Sebastian van Strien at the Mathematics Institute of the University of Warwick in Coventry, United Kingdom.  NSF's Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary Activities is providing half of the funding for this project.\r\nThis project involves the study of the dynamics of maps with the symmetries of symmetric and alternating groups.  Crass's work centers on complex algebraic dynamical systems with large symmetry groups.  His research relates classical Galois theory and the geometry of simple groups to real and complex analytic dynamics.  Of particular interest to him, is the interplay between the rich geometric structure and the global dynamics.\r\n\r\nDr. van Strien's group at Warwick is very active in the field of dynamical systems.  His group includes Tan Lei, Anthony Manning, and Oleg Kozlovsky. \r\n***\r\n",
