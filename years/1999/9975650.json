 "awd_abstract_narration": "9975650\r\nTeraoka\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for the development of an automated system of high osmotic pressure chromatography (HOPC) for preparative separation of polymer by the molecular weight (MW) and copolymer by the chemical composition (CC).  Lack of methods to prepare well-defined polymer samples with a specific architecture as represented by MW and CC has been compromising rigorous understanding of structure-property relationship and improvement in design of polymer-based materials.  \r\n\r\nThis system will employ computer-controlled loading and injection of the concentrated polymer solution by two pumps.  A dynamic light scattering detector characterizes the MW distribution of the eluent in real time.  In the copolymer separation, a CCD array detector will be used alone or in tandem with the light scattering detector for real-time composition analysis.  The instrument will be shared among researchers at Polytechnic University.  The planned research projects include study of thermodynamics of separation at high concentrations, controlled biological processing of polymer synthesis, preparation of dimer-free protein crystals, study of competitive adsorption, and study of dynamics in blends of block copolymers and epoxy networks.  The HOPC system will also be used as a part of the graduate polymer laboratory course to educate students and to use the equipment for research.\r\n%%%\r\nThis innovative system is expected to significantly impact research and education in polymer science and engineering.\r\n***\r\n",
