 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds programs for research and education with special\r\nemphasis in combinatorics and number theory. The investigator\r\nplans to study the combinatorics of partition functions, the\r\nstructure of elliptic curves, the Fourier coefficients\r\nof modular forms, and special values of automorphic L-functions.\r\nThe investigator hopes to shed further light on the behavior\r\nof Mordell-Weil groups of elliptic curves, class groups of number\r\nfields, and Selmer groups. In addition to his research, the investigator\r\nproposes a number of broadly based activities which constitute\r\nan ambitious and sustained effort for the promotion of \r\neducation at all levels.\r\nThis includes the mentoring of talented high school students locally\r\nwithin the State College School District, and nationally in the\r\nform of an annual workshop run in collaboration with the\r\nNational Youth Science Foundation. Moreover, the investigator\r\nintends to enhance opportunities for graduate students\r\nand postdoctoral fellows working in combinatorics and number theory\r\nat Penn State.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early development\r\nof academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The Faculty Early\r\nCareer Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program that\r\nprovides for the support of junior faculty within the context of their\r\noverall career development.  It combines in a single program the support of\r\nquality research and education in the broadest sense and the full participation\r\nof those traditionally underrepresented in sciences and engineering.  This\r\nprogram enhances and emphasizes the importance the Foundation places\r\non the development of full, balanced academic careers.\r\n",
