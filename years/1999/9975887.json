 "awd_abstract_narration": "9975887\r\nPekarek\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for the acquisition of  a SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device) magnetometer that will be located at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Florida where no similar system currently exists.  The SQUID magnetometer uses an extremely sensitive technique for magnetic measurements of samples with low total magnetization over a temperature range from 1.9-400 K in fields up to 7 Tesla.  The proposed instrument is automated and can acquire a large amount of data at a relatively low cost.  The combination of extreme sensitivity, automation, and low cost result in a very powerful research tool capable of providing high-quality data for several research groups.\r\n\r\nResearch groups at the University of North Florida, University of Northern Iowa, and Fordham University will all utilize the SQUID magnetometer.  In each case, the instrument will provide significant new capabilities to the research areas including III-VI and II-VI Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors, magnetic clusters in III-V semi-conductors, and magnetic rare earth and rare earth-transition metal alloys.  In many cases, the data gathered from the SQUID magnetometer will allow the current research projects to address new significant issues directly related to the current studies.  The final impacts of the proposed instrument will not only allow new issues to be addressed but it will also lead to a more comprehensive analysis of the systems under study.\r\n\r\nThe data obtained by this instrument complements the state-of-the-art facilities at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), which is located in Tallahassee, Florida (only a few hours drive from the University of North Florida).  The SQUID magnetometer is significantly more cost effective than the NHMFL for fields below 7 Tesla and would free up magnet time at the NHMFL that would otherwise be requested for lower field measurements.\r\n\r\nThis instrument will be incorporated into the Advanced Physics Laboratory as a prominent focus of this senior-level undergraduate course for physics majors.  This will allow undergraduate physics majors the opportunity to investigate fundamental physics phenomena in classic systems as well as in current research areas using a very powerful research tool.\r\n%%%\r\nThe acquisition of this instrument will significantly enhance the research capabilities of investigators at this institution, as well as at several others, and enrich the educational experience of students.\r\n***\r\n",
