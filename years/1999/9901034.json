Structural health monitoring is an emerging technology, which combines advanced sensing technology with a knowledge of material/structural damage characteristics to monitor the condition of structures in real time while in service.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the workshop are to review the progress of the current rapid technological development in the field, to identify key and emerging issues in research and development, and to promote exchanges and cross-fertilization among many disciplines and these applications, such as rotorcraft and aircraft structures, civil infrastructures, vehicle and marine structures, and hazard mitigation.\r\n\r\nKey and distinguished individuals from industry, academe, and government will be invited to give keynote lectures and presentations in the workshop.  Product and technology demonstrations will also be conducted.  The workshop will conclude with panel discussions on key issues and concerns to be identified during the workshop.  The workshop will result in proceedings containing the presentations of the workshop.  Appropriate guidelines and recommendations for government agencies and industry to promote structural health monitoring development will be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
