SMET courses will be made more rigorous by requiring that students taking general chemistry, the gatekeeper course, be qualified to take calculus or pre-calculus. This means that the student must have satisfactorily completed college algebra and trigonometry. Incorporation of cutting edge technology, and research-based instruction to enhance the learning experience of students will better equip students to meet the standard. SMET students, identified at the freshman level, will be given rigorous instruction in basic courses and mentoring in all SMET disciplines. The rigorous instruction and mentoring will continue throughout the undergraduate program and will facilitate the transition into graduate school.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to: (1) develop and maintain a diverse and intellectually vigorous faculty committed to the improvement of undergraduate education; (2) strengthen SMET curricula, courses and laboratories by Total Quality Control and Management(TQC&M) at the entry level classes; (3) develop partnerships with academic and industrial institutions; (4) prepare students for graduate school; (5) stimulate faculty and professional organizations to be involved in the Graduate and Research Opportunities Oriented Mentoring(GROOM); and (6) increase SMET enrollment, retention, and graduation.\r\n",
