 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971674\r\nRundell\r\n\r\nThis proposal investigates several inverse problems for partial differential \r\nequations.  Our particular focus is in uniqueness results that seek the \r\nminimal amount of data required to determine unknown coefficients lying \r\nwithin certain predetermined classes. We are also interested in \r\nreconstruction methods based on iteration schemes and in particular to \r\nschemes that utilize higher derivatives of the coefficient to data map. \r\nFinally, for certain undetermined coefficient problems we propose to \r\ninvestigate the following: given information (or assumptions) on the error \r\nin the data, that is, what type of distribution it obeys and what are the \r\nsignificant moments, what is the distribution of the possible \r\nreconstructions of the coefficient?\r\n\r\nMany objects of physical interest cannot be studied directly. Examples \r\ninclude imaging the interior of the body, the determination of cracks \r\nwithin solid objects, and material parameters such as the conductivity of \r\ninaccessible objects. When these problems are translated into \r\nmathematical terms they take the form of partial differential equations, the \r\nLingua Franca of the mathematical sciences. The additional unknowns in \r\nthe model translate into unknown parameters in the equations and we \r\nattempt to solve for these by means of further measurements. In this \r\nproposal we deal with the practical aspects of this from a mathematical \r\nperspective: We are interested in the question of when a unique \r\ndetermination can be made, as well as designing algorithms for the \r\nefficient numerical recovery of the unknowns. The mathematical \r\ntechniques used and to be developed are applicable to several different \r\nscientific problems. Examples are: (1) The recovery of the location and \r\nshape of interior objects from surface measurements. Applications here \r\ninclude the determination of tumors (which are characterized by a greater \r\nmetabolic rate) and buried mines and munitions (characterized by a higher \r\nelectrical conductivity). (2) The determination of the interior density \r\nprofile of the sun from spectral data. This is important because it would \r\nprovide an independent check of our current understanding of both the \r\ncomposition of a star such as the sun and the underlying physics with \r\nwhich we model its internal reactions.\r\n",
