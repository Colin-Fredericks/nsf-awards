The meeting offers members of the Maize Genetics community the opportunity to present and discuss their most recent research results.  A wide range of topics are covered, ranging from classical to molecular genetics.  The 41st Annual meeting will feature 45 minute talks by four invited speakers, 15 minute talks given by individual participants, two poster sessions, and two workshops.  The invited speakers will be:  Susan Wessler, University of Georgia; Richard Jorgensen, University of Arizona; Patrick Schnable, Iowa State University; and Susan McCouch, Cornell University.  The workshops will focus on two timely subjects:  Genomic Approaches for Maize and Cereal Research and Technology Transfer and Licensing.\r\n\r\nThe Maize Genetics meeting provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers.\r\n",
