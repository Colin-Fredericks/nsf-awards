Oswald\r\nCornell University\r\nProposal:  9974604\r\n\r\nInformation in the brain is transmitted from one nerve cell to another by the release of a messenger molecule from the presynaptic cell, which diffuses across the small space and interacts with a receptor protein imbedded in the membrane of the postsynaptic cell. Glutamate is the most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. The receptors for glutamate bind the amino acid, and respond by opening a channel between the outside of the cell and the inside of the cell allowing positively charged ions to flow across the cell membrane. Dr. Oswald is characterizing the structure, dynamics, and regulation of several glutamate receptors.  The first half of the project will focus on the binding of glutamate and related ligands.  The binding of these compounds seems to result a major change in the binding domain characterized by a large movement of one half of the domain relative to the other half.  The contributions to the binding energy of allosteric interactions between these domains will be studied using site-directed mutagenesis.  In addition, the kinetics of this conformational change will be studied with millisecond resolution.  The second half of the project will focus on the interaction of intracellular portions of glutamate receptors with cytoplasmic control factors.  These investigations will yield novel data on the structure, function, and regulation of glutamate receptors in the brain and are important for understanding adaptive mechanisms that have been borrowed from simple organisms for use in higher species during evolution. In addition, these studies may provide information about the molecular basis for learning and memory.\r\n",
