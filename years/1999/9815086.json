This will be a 2000 sq. ft. exhibit and will take the form of a trip along the Hudson River.  Part I, \"The Journey,\"  will introduce seven distinct river environments from Lake Tear in the Clouds to the New York Harbor.  Part II,  \"River People,\"  will present human occupations and activities that are related to the river such as a shad fisherman, a municipal planner, a sewage treatment worker, and an environmental educator.  The exhibit will present four fundamental, interrelated environmental concepts:  ecosystems, habitats, adaptation, and human impact on the environment.  Learners will immerse themselves in a habitat by \"becoming\" Hudson River animals and by role playing field guides, urban planners, etc.  National science standards will provide a framework for the exhibit and complementary educational activities.  The complementary materials will include pre- and post-visit materials for use by teachers and their students.  These will include visual, auditory, tactile and kinesthetic activities that will connect the science education requirements with the exhibit.  Information about the exhibit will be broadly disseminated and it is expected that other similar museums will emulate this approach.  The exhibit is scheduled to open in January, 2001.  \r\n",
