The objective is to study how and under what conditions the structures of various simple molecular liquids deviate near interfaces and in thin films from the structures of these liquids in bulk. While much evidence, generally indirect, suggests that molecules layer near interfaces, it is only recently, during previous work on this project, that this molecular layering has been directly observed with x-ray methods. Thin films of simple organic liquids and water will be studied. both on one solid surface and sandwiched between two solid surfaces. Order normal to film plane and within the film plane will be probed using synchrotron x-rays. The dependence of the observed ordering on the film thickness, the nature of the supporting solid surface, and temperature will be investigate in detail. The research will provide excellent training for graduate students in modern diffraction methods and in an area with both fundamental and applied interest.\r\n%%%\r\nThe structure of liquids near surfaces is expected to be different near air/liquid interfaces or at other liquid interfaces. However, direct x-ray structure determination of this interface structure has only recently been achieved by this project. This award will allow the project to continue. The knowledge gained from this project will help determine why liquids behave differently (from the bulk phase) when confined between plates or constrained by an interface. This could lead to methods to design specific interfacial liquid properties. Such an understanding is important for lubrication, filtration, tertiary oil recovery, wetting and spreading processes in industry, and many other technologically relevant applications. The research will provide excellent training for graduate students in modern diffraction methods and in an area with both fundamental and applied interest.\r\n",
