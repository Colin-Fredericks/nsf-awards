 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the Vertebrate Paleontological Collections at the Peabody Museum of Natural History.  The foundation of the collections are those specimens collected in the American West by Othniel Charles Marsh during the storied \"dinosaur rush\" of the late 19th century.  The fossils stored in Marsh's Dinosaur Room include the first described specimens of such famous and familiar dinosaurs as Apatosaurus (Brontosaurus),  Barosaurus and Stegosaurus.  \r\n\r\nMarsh's dinosaurs were reposited at Yale approximately seventy years ago.  The bones are stored on open racks with rusted metal grating shelves.  Many of the larger bones are stored on dirty, ancient jute-filled canvas pads.  The open storage has allowed all of the fossils to become covered with years of dust and grime.  Inadequately supported by the jute-filled pads, virtually ninety percent of the larger bones in the room have broken under their own weight.  Many others have broken due to the failure of old adhesives.  In many cases, various parts of one specimen are stored in differing parts of the room, making it even more difficult to study a single specimen.  \r\n\r\nThe entire Vertebrate Paleontology collection is slated to move after the construction of a new environmental science facility that will house other Peabody Museum collections.  When those collections are removed from the basement of Kline Geology Laboratory the Vertebrate Paleontology collection will expand into environmentally controlled spaces.  The project will treat these specimens before the move.  While the condition of the specimens alone merits the proposed project, the scheduled relocation makes it imperative to conserve the specimens now as it is impossible to safely move them in their current condition.\r\n\r\nThe steps taken to improve this collection will include:\r\n1.\tSmall specimens and fragments that are currently in open cardboard trays will be placed in polyethylene foam lined trays or polypropylene containers, separated by polyethylene foam to prevent damage.  Where necessary, polyethylene foam mounts will be fabricated for smaller specimens in need of extra support.\r\n\r\n2.\tLonger, heavier bones, such as limb bones, will be supported with polyethylene foam lined plaster bedding jackets, and smaller bones, such as vertebrae, with polyethylene foam supports.  \r\n\r\n3.\tFragile paper data will be cleaned and encapsulated in Mylar film to preserve it.\r\n\r\n4.\tAll available data will be entered into the Peabody Museum's on-line data base.\r\n\r\n5.\tWith the help of Dr. John McIntosh, an expert on both sauropod dinosaurs and the O.C. Marsh Expeditions, this material will be curated.  Locations and names will be noted on both shelf labels and in the computerized database.\r\nThis project concerns the Vertebrate Paleontological Collections at the Peabody Museum of Natural History.
