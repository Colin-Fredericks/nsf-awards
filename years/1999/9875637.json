 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet is facing two problems simultaneously: there is a need for faster switching/routing\r\ncapacity to carry the continued growth of user data, and there is a need to introduce guaranteed\r\nqualities of service (QoS) for real-time traffic.  Each problem can be solved independently - the fastest single-stage switches and routers can be made using input-queued crossbar switches, instead of shared memory systems limited by memory bandwidth.  And QoS can be provided using numerous well-known techniques, such as weighted fair queueing (WFQ).  However, until now, these two solutions have been mutually exclusive; all of the work on algorithms that provide QoS has required that switches and routers use shared memory or output queueing.\r\nThe Next Generation Internet (NGI) will require hugely increased capacity, and distinguished and guaranteed qualities of service.  Building on previous research on high performance switches and routers, the proposed work will follow three avenues in an attempt to solve the problem of simultaneously increasing network capacity and providing QoS:\r\n1. Switch Speedup.  Using a new technique called \"precise emulation via speedup\", cross-bar switches can be built that precisely emulate output queued and centralized shared memory switches, yet use memories that run at only twice the speed of the external line.  This promising technique enables switches and routers to provide guaranteed QoS at speeds much higher than before.  In this work, new practical algorithms will be developed, studied and prototyped with the goal of making this technique available to the industry at large,\r\n2. The Fork-Join Router.  This is a new highly parallel architecture for single-stage IP routers with aggregate capacities in excess of 1Tb/s.  Using multiple forms of parallelism simultaneously, different parts of the system may operate at different speeds, allowing a particular implementation to make best use of the available switching, and forwarding technology.  The router is highly fault-tolerant, degrading gracefully when sub-systems fail.  Perhaps most importantly, the fork-join router can use the \"speedup\" technique for Terabit routers that provide precise QoS guarantees.\r\n3. The Streaming Processor.  Network switches and routers require fast processing elements that process data as it \"streams through.\"  Streaming data is not processed well by traditional heavily-pipelined load-store RISC CPUs.  There is a need for a processor architecture optimized for streaming data, in which the CPU is part of a larger system pipeline, and in which data with spatial, but not temporal, locality can be processed at very high speed.  Such a device would enable faster forwarding decisions in routers, perform\r\nfaster scheduling algorithms to provide QoS, and perform fast transcoding of net-work data.\r\nAn important goal is to see the research used by industry and in the NGI.  Therefore, a goal of\r\nthe proposed research is to transfer the technology to the builders of \"carrier-class\" switching and routing equipment, and to encourage rapid adoption.",
