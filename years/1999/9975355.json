 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, carried out by Professor Vicki H. Wysocki and her students at the University of Arizona and supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program,  develops a novel surface characterization tool to provide qualitative identification and quantification of the functional groups present in the outermost atomic layers of organic thin films.  The core of the method is use of  hyperthermal collisions of atomic and polyatomic ions with these surfaces, and subsequent study of  ion/surface reactions, neutralization yields, projectile dissociation efficiency, and chemical sputtering to determine the surface composition.  Hyperthermal collisions are used to study single composition and mixed composition model surfaces, many of which are composed of thiolate self-assembled monolayers and Langmuir-Blodgett films.  Contact angle, FTIR, atomic force microscopy, ellipsometry, and XPS measurements are also used as independent analytical probes of the surface composition.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wysocki and her students at the University of Arizona use the carefully controlled collisions of slow moving ions with surfaces to reveal the composition of the organic overlayers on those surface.  Subtle features of the surface are revealed by using more complex structures for the incoming ions.  Chemical reactions between the surface and the incoming ions are also used to reveal structure and composition.  The slowness of the incoming ion means that only the top few atomic layers of the surface are examined.  Reactivity and structure of such thin films is of major interest area in areas such as sensors, catalysis, and new electronic devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
