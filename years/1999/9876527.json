 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decisions on alternative options often involve risks and uncertainties.  \r\nShould we buy flood insurance or would we rather save the money?  \r\nDo we prefer a high-risk or a low-risk stock market investment?\r\nWhen do we choose surgery rather than chemotherapy for cancer treatment?\r\nShould we take a risky option and try to save all the people with a one-third \r\nchance of success or should we avoid the risk and save one-third of them for certain?\r\n\r\n\tThis research project examines how people automatically search,\r\nselect, and use social and communicational cues under real world constraints \r\nto determine their risk behavior. Our previous findings have shown that people \r\nare sensitive to cues of kinship, anonymity, group size, group constitution, and \r\nhedonic verbal framing/phrasing of choice options and place different priorities \r\nupon these decision cues. These pieces of information embedded in a decision problem \r\ndetermine the minimally acceptable outcome, which is called the \"minimum requirement\" \r\n(MR) for a particular task. According to the proposed mean-variance model of risky choice,\r\n a decision maker tries to maximize the chance of reaching the MR. Suppose there are two \r\nchoice options: a sure gain of $100 vs. a gamble with a 50% chance of wining $300 and a \r\n50% chance of losing $100. That is, the two options have the same mean outcome but different\r\nvariances.\r\n\r\n\tThe mean-variance model takes into account the relationship between the\r\nMR, the expected mean values of choice options, and the variances in those choices.\r\nWhen the expected mean value of the options is below the MR, a decision maker is expected \r\nto favor a high variance (gamble) option over its sure-thing equivalent, because higher \r\nvariance increases the chance of reaching the MR. In contrast, when the mean value is above \r\nthe MR, the participants are expected to be risk averse and favor the sure thing over\r\nthe gamble to avoid possible harms (i.e., falling below the MR).\r\n\r\n\tThe model also predicts that the mean-variance heuristic will\r\nbe reversed either when MR is higher than the mean plus variance or when MR\r\nis extremely low. The predictions will be tested in different task domains (e.g., life\r\nvs. money), with different expected values (e.g., 600 lives vs. 6 lives; $6000 vs. $600),\r\n different payoffs (e.g., the number of lives vs. life-span expectancy) and different samples of the participants (e.g., students, local residents, professionals), in different task conditions (e.g.,\r\nfeedback by computer displays, lottery games), under both positive and negative framing conditions, and cross-culturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
