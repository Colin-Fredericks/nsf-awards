One is to find a topological definition of the\r\nSeiberg-Witten invariants, perhaps by exploiting almost complex\r\nstructures on 4-manifolds which are \"tight\" in some sense other than\r\nbeing symplectic.  Second is to find a natural construction of a\r\n4-manifold which has as boundary the connected sum of three copies\r\n(with alternating orientations) of a given closed 3-manifold.  Third\r\nis (with Paul Melvin) to finish work on the handlebody structure of\r\ncertain complex elliptic surfaces.\r\n\r\nManifolds of dimension four are the least understood of all\r\ndimensions, yet they occur frequently, for example, in relation to the\r\nthree spatial and one temporal dimensions of physical space-time.  A\r\nfundamental problem is to classify these manifolds, where classify\r\nmeans to understand them in terms of relatively simple invariants\r\nwhich can be computed.  The Seiberg-Witten invariants which were\r\ndiscovered in 1994 by mathematical physicists are the best current set\r\nof invariants, and much work needs to be done in understanding and\r\nextending them.  One technique is handlebody theory which involves a\r\nsimple way of describing a manifold in terms of simple building\r\nblocks. \r\n",
