William McCallum, Iowa State University (ISU), and Luis Fabietti, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Argentina.  The focus of the research will be on the processing and characterization of exchanged-enhanced NdFeB-based permanent magnets.  These magnets are of fundamental interest because they are made out of composites with high remnant magnetization and moderate coercivity.  Yet, their application has been hindered by metallurgical obstacles in their processing.  The collaborators propose to study the effect of nucleation temperature, undercooling and recalescence  on the formation of  microstructures, with the aim of developing effective processing routes.  \r\n\r\nThe development of improved permanent magnet materials is a topic of major interest to the materials community, and is also of strong interest in regards to the large economic potential of high performance permanent magnet materials.  The team of researchers brings together an excellent combination of skills and experience, as well as of facilities.  The Ames Laboratory  in ISU will enable microstructural characterization not available in Argentina, while the US side will gain access to twin roller melt spinning apparatus  in Argentina, thus enabling the collaborators to expand the range of materials that can be investigated. .     \r\n***\r\n",
