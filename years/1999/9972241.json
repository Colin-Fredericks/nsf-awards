This is mainly because a solution to the \r\nproblem can be produced in a relatively easy way in a highly desirable \r\nform.  Two major drawbacks are that (1) not all systems can be adequately \r\napproximated by linear-quadratic models and (2) the state space must be \r\nrelatively small for efficient implementation of the results.  The fully \r\nconvex model featured in this proposal significantly broadens the \r\napplicable scope of the linear-quadratic paradigm while still maintaining \r\nmany of its attractive features.  In particular, the fully convex problem \r\npermits hard constraints on the control variables, a situation often present \r\nin applications but not accounted for in the traditional framework, and thus \r\nwill partly appease the drawback (1).  The proposal seeks to unite modern \r\ntrends in Hamilton-Jacobi theory with the fully convex control model both \r\ntheoretically and computationally.  To alleviate (2), the proposal seeks to \r\ndevelop efficient algorithms based on the rich convex duality structure.  A \r\nsecondary objective involves a detailed analysis on aspects of asymptotic \r\nstability of nonlinear systems, in particular the construction and use of \r\nLyapunov functions.\r\n\r\nOptimal control theory is a mathematical discipline with far reaching \r\napplications throughout science, engineering, economics, and industry.  \r\nThe existing theory is constantly being challenged by these applications, \r\nwhich subsequently provides motivation for the development of more \r\nsophisticated mathematical tools.  This proposal aims at making \r\ntheoretical and computational progress in a mathematical model that is \r\nwidely used in applications but which has by no means reached its full \r\npotential.  The applicability of the proposed goals would be an increase in \r\nthe efficiency and a broadening of the scope of an important standard \r\nmodeling tool.\r\n",
