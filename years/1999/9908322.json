 "awd_abstract_narration": "Facility design has a profound effect on the efficiency, flexibility and economic success of an organization over a long time period.  The problem of facility design is well known, however it has almost always been studied as the \"greenfield\" design problem, that is, the design of a wholly new facility. This project, however, focuses on redesign of existing facilities.  Redesign is important because facilities typically have long\r\nlifetimes and operational requirements change over time.  In redesign there are constraints to be considered that were not relevant, or were less important, in the initial design.  This research will develop a\r\ncomprehensive, integrated framework that explicitly focuses on redesign and while considering production uncertainty.  Block design of the location of departments or work centers is integrated with the detailed design of aisle structure, material handling system, machine placement and input/output locations.   Another objective is to improve the design optimization objective function by matching the choice of flowpath distance metric with the type of material handling system and explicitly considering uncertainty of product forecasts and production methods.  The notions of robustness to uncertainty and flexibility for future changes will be incorporated into the usual cost objectives.\r\n     The results this research will lead to improved facilities designs for both manufacturing and service operations. Direct benefits will include higher productivity, reduced costs, and enhanced customer service. To ensure industrial relevance and to enhance technology transfer, this research will involve working with a  manufacturer with very diverse production environments to provide actual redesign problem data, to evaluate the methodologies and software developed, and to provide an industrial experience for students.  Dissemination of this research will be conducted through the College Industry Council on Material Handling Education (CIC-MHE) of the Material Handling Industry of America, along with the usual channels of conferences, web sites and refereed publications.  By using the CIC-MHE conduit, results should reach a wide audience of practitioners, educators and researchers in a timely manner.\r\n",
