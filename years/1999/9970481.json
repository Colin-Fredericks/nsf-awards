The main goal is to\r\ngeneralize and strengthen the result of Abhyankar's Conjecture, which was\r\nproven by Raynaud and the Principal Investigator.  That result classified\r\nthe Galois groups of unramified covers of affine curves over an\r\nalgebraically closed field of finite characteristic.  By strengthening\r\nthis conjecture, more understanding would be achieved of how the Galois\r\ncovers of a given curve fit together, and thus about the structure of the\r\nfundamental group.  By generalizing the conjecture, results would be\r\nobtained about Galois groups over affine varieties in higher dimensions,\r\nand over curves defined over more general base fields.  Methods will\r\ninclude formal patching, specialization, cohomology, and the theory of\r\nprofinite groups.\r\n\r\nThe subject area of this project brings together two areas of mathematics\r\nthat each concern symmetry -- symmetry in algebra, in the case of Galois\r\ntheory; and symmetry in geometry, in the case of fundamental groups.  In\r\neach of these two situations, mathematical objects can be studied by\r\nexamining the forms that their symmetries can take.  The connection\r\nbetween the two settings arises from the fact that geometric spaces can be\r\ndescribed by algebraic equations, and those equations can be studied by\r\nGalois theory.  The symmetries of the equations then relate to fundamental\r\ngroups of geometric spaces.  A problem that is posed in either of these\r\ntwo settings can then be translated into a problem in the other setting,\r\nwhere other techniques can be applied in order to provide a solution.\r\nThis project concerns how these two situations can interact, so that\r\nalgebra can be used in the service of geometry, and vice versa, in order\r\nto study problems that would otherwise be intractable.\r\n",
