 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile ad hoc networks are multi-hop wireless networks, with dynamically changing network topology.  In this project,the researcherse will investigate several protocol design issues corresponding to routing, medium-access control, and transport layers in mobile ad hoc networks.  The focus is on performance issues related to individual layers as well as inter-layer interactions.  Routing is recognized to be the central challenge in mobile ad hoc networks.  Many routing protocols use on-demand network-wide flooding to locate the destination. The researchers propose to evaluate two techniques to localize flooding to only a limited region | one based on location information, and the other based on locality heuristics.  The proposed approaches are expected to reduce routing overhead as well as end-to-end packet delivery delays.  This project will also investigate medium-access control (MAC) designs that aid efficient routing. In particular, the researchers propose to evaluate multi-channel CSMA schemes that minimize multiple access interference at high load.  These schemes are expected to reduce the detrimental effects of a broadcast flood.  Finally, this project will also consider the impact of MAC and routing protocols on transport protocol (particularly, TCP). The researchers will investigate how TCP's flow and congestion control mechanism is affected by mobility and medium access contention, and develop techniques to improve TCP performance on mobile ad hoc networks.",
