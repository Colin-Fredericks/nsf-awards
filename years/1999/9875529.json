The research deals with non-equilibrium dynamics of excited granular media, focusing on a monolayer of nearly identical spheres on a flat plate vibrating vertically. This simple and easily controllable system exhibits a rich variety of cooperative phenomena which will be quantitatively investigated using computer imaging techniques. Direct measurements of the statistical distribution and correlation functions necessary for the construction of a kinetic theory of the non-equilibrium granular fluid will be made. Transport of particles, energy , and momentum in the layer will be studied and compared with the behavior predicted from the kinetic theory.  In addition, the novel collective behavior of the system will be studied to develop and test theories of `granular thermodynamics'. These results will provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics of granular media, an essential step towards improved models of a wide range of important industrial processes. These conceptually simple but visually striking experiments will be used to increase the number and quality of physics majors through incorporation into a statistical mechanics course and a travelling show to be taken to local high schools in the community.\r\n%%% \r\nThis is a Condensed Matter Physics CAREER project. The research deals with the behavior of a large number of nearly identical spherical particles on a vibrating plate. This simple and easily controllable system exhibits a rich variety of surprising phenomena that arise from the energy lost during inter-particle collision. The behavior will be quantitatively investigated using computer imaging techniques. Theories that relate the statistical behavior of individual grains to the average properties of the collection of grains will be developed and tested.  These results will provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics of granular media, an essential step towards improved models of a wide range of important  industrial processes, including transport and processing of grains and powders, and gas fluidized beds used in petroleum processing. These conceptually simple but visually striking  experiments will be used to increase the number and quality of physics majors through incorporation into undergraduate courses, and a traveling show to be taken to local high schools in the community.\r\n",
