 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the upgrade of the seawater filtration capabilities\r\nof the sea water system at the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL)\r\nto provide enhanced support research programs involving culturing of\r\nmarine organisms.  The controlled experimental research that characterizes\r\nmuch of today's activities at marine laboratories includes leading-edge\r\nbiochemical/molecular and physiological/bioenergetic research on the \r\necology of marine organisms.  The nature of the sea water systems\r\nat marine laboratories have evolved from simple supply of, at most, \r\ncoarse-filtered sea water to holding tanks and aquaria to fairly sophisticated \r\nsystems that must provide fine-filtered and temperature-regulated sea\r\nwater to support the experimental studies underlying that research.  \r\nOver the last decade the sea water and laboratory support facilities at\r\nCBL in its Truitt Controlled Environmental Laboratory(CEL) have been\r\nredesigned, reconfigured, and engineered to provide the treatment\r\ncomponents that support experimental needs.  Many of the research\r\nprograms carried out at CBL in the fields of ecology/oceanography,\r\naquatic toxicology, and environmental chemistry/geochemistry depend\r\non the high quality of temperature-controlled and filtered sea water\r\nprovided to support the experimental studies of marine organisms in\r\nthe Truitt Controlled Environment Laboratory.\r\n\r\nHowever, the present filtration equipment is inadequate for the larger\r\ndemand and more stringent quality requirements for filtered sea water\r\nto support the research needs currently underway and anticipated growth\r\nin the near future.  Maintenance of the present system is also labor intensive.\r\nThis project would replace the current sand filter system with a membrane-\r\nBased micro-filtration system that will double the present volume of filtered\r\nwater (from 50 to 100 gpm) and greatly increase suspended particle removal\r\n(from>5 to 1 micron).  The new system will eliminate inadequate especially\r\nduring summer months when research demand for filtered water is especially\r\nhigh and the need for downtime and labor-intensive and costly media changes\r\nusing the present pressure sand filter technology.  \r\n",
