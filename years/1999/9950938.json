 "awd_abstract_narration": "Highly interactive, computer-based learning aids for students taking mechanics of materials courses are under development.  These learning aides, in the form of courseware, focus directly on the refinement of students' abilities to solve problems. Subjects covered include shear and bending moment diagrams, beam deflection, internal torques and rotations, internal loads and stresses in three-dimensions, stress transformations, and axial loading of bars.  A  set of fundamental analysis skills critical to success in the topic forms the basis for each module. Computer exercises that (i) review the relevant theory, (ii) give step-by-step instruction as to solving relevant types of problems and (iii) invite students to actually solve such problems constitute each module.  In the problem solving mode, the modules of the courseware offer immediate feedback, as well as help and hint on an as-needed basis. Since the modules generate new problems ad infinitum, students can work with the material as long as necessary for mastery.   Because the courseware will also set up log files, students can complete assignments as convenient and submit them electronically. This courseware is compatible with any Windows-based platform requiring minimal memory and storage, facilitating easy integration into existing mechanics of materials courses.    \r\n\r\n",
