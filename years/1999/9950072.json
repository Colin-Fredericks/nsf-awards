 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Plastics Resources for Educators Program (PREP) is establishing the educational infrastructure necessary for ensuring that the U.S. plastics industry remains internationally competitive. Today, plastics manufacturing represents the nation's fourth largest and the fastest growing industry (10 percent a year) with a need for an additional 250,000 plastics technicians / engineers by the year 2005.\r\n\r\nPREP is a consortium between two primary institutions: The Pennsylvania College of Technology (Penn College) and The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). There are also 3 other \"support\" institutions providing project input to the PREP initiative. PREP has an established industry advisory board and an independent evaluation team headed by Dr. Gordon McCarty of Bayer.\r\n\r\nThere are three primary outcomes of PREP. The first is the definition, maintenance, and contributions to the PREP Bookshelf. The PREP Bookshelf is a warehouse of instructional materials for use in plastics technology education. The second outcome is the development of a National Plastics Forum. Through development of the PREP website, a LISTSERVE, NetMeeting capability, and annual workshops the project is helping to keep faculty continually interfacing for the solution of common problems. The last outcome is better pre-college outreach through collaboration with project partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
