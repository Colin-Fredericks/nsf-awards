 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Long Beach Elementary Science/Mathematics Teacher Education Partnership (LBESTEP) is a three-year effort to improve and focus K-8 teacher preparation in mathematics and the sciences in Long Beach. Long Beach is a notably diverse urban community, and home of both the third largest school system in California, and the Long Beach Seamless Education Initiative (LBSEI) founded in 1994. LBSEI is dedicated to K-18 seamless education in all disciplines through strong partnerships between California State University at Long Beach (CSULB), Long Beach City College (LBCC), and Long Beach Unified School District (LBUSD). Through the LBSEI, as well as through linkages to existing excellent NSF-CETP programs such as LACTE and MASTEP in California, we will undertake four major activities: (1) prepare the faculty and the institutions of higher education to undertake reform of math/science curriculum; (2) build pre-service teacher involvement in science and mathematics, through a variety of strategies; (3) reform undergraduate science/mathematics in core Liberal Students courses to align them with national standards and best practices in both content and pedagogy; and (4) broaden the offering in K-8 pre-service curricula to include choices such as math/science \"specialist.\" we will involve scientists and mathematicians from LBCC and CSULB in all aspects of the teacher preparation program, through workshops and participation in team teaching and faculty mentoring. Oversight for LBESTEP will be provided through outside evaluator and National Visiting Committee assessment.",
