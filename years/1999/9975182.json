 "awd_abstract_narration": "9975182\r\nThis award will provide partial support for the development of an ultrahigh-resolution photoelectron analyzer system for angle-resolved photoemission studies of basic physical effects and phenomena related to quantum structures. A new undulator beamline at the Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) is under construction, and is scheduled to begin operation in early 1999. This beamline, coupled to a state-of-the-art Normal Incidence Monochromator, will deliver a flux up to 5x10 12 photons per second at a resolving power of 10,000 at 20 eV (corresponding to an energy resolution of 2 meV, and better at lower energies). This represents orders of magnitude improvement over the systems currently in use at SRC, and will offer opportunities for detailed studies of the electronic properties of solids, surfaces, adsorbates, quantum wells, and thin film systems. The PI and co-PI are members of this beamline's development team. \r\n\r\nThis grant will provide funds for a state-of-the-art analyzer system equipped with a two-dimensional position-sensitive detector designed for simultaneous collection of energy and angle dependent data at high resolution (<3 meV and 0.2 degrees). This will enable the examination of quasiparticle lineshapes at precisely specified points in k space and at energies very close to the Fermi level in various metals, and thus to clarify basic issues related to the Fermi liquid behavior and electron correlation effects.\r\n\r\nMany students, postdocs, and scientists from other institutions will use the instrument.  Training of students and postdocs will include the use of synchrotron radiation, a state-of-the-art analyzer, a two dimensional detector system, and related materials preparation and characterization techniques.\r\n\r\n&&&\r\nThe system to be developed will significantly enhance the capability to investigate basic photoemission phenomena and quantum mechanical effects in many materials, and train a large number of students for careers in many sectors of the workforce.\r\n\r\n",
