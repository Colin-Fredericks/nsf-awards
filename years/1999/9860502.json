 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860502\r\n     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I Project will demonstrate the feasibility of producing highly conducting wires by extrusion of polymers filled with nanoparticles of silver and copper.  Working with our collaborators at Fraunhofer Resource Center-Delaware (FRC-DE), we have made advances in filled polymers in a new direction by incorporating metallic micron size fillers that are aggregates of nansocale (~50 nm) particles.  Such a unique morphology of the filler material enables reduction of the percolation threshold to below 10 vol.%, which is much lower than the percolation threshold in conventional fillers.  High conductivity, combined with good mechanical properties were achieved in polymer matrix tapes as a result of this novel polymer-metal nanocomposite structure.  In Phase I of the project, we will fabricate polymer nanocomposite wires with high room temperature electrical conductivity, modulus and tensile strength.  The Phase II program will consist of optimizing the properties, building a prototype continuous production unit, establishing production protocols, and working closely with end-user companies.  Large-scale production will be undertaken in Phase III.\r\n     There is a need to produce filled polymers that have low density, high electrical conductivity, high modulus and tensile strength.  Our unique method of incorporating micron size porous fillers consisting of aggregated nanoscale particles is a solution to the problem.  The new material is a potential replacement for the heavier metallic wires, can be used as conducting tapes and adhesives, and so large markets can be addressed.\r\n",
