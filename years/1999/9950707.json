 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will facilitate completion of the final, key components of our current, sweeping revision of the undergraduate physics curriculum. A primary emphasis is the relevance of multiple academic tracks within the department to post graduation employment, as enhanced through integration of computer-assisted learning and familiarity with modem instrumentation. The project will produce a coherent, sequential set of hands-on courses from the introductory courses through our capstone Undergraduate Research course. A unique feature will be the implementation of HTML documents throughout the curriculum that uniformly integrate the software for instrumentation control, data acquisition, analysis and visualization, and modeling. We build on previous NSF-ILI, industrial, state, and institutional funding that focused primarily on introductory elements of our program. The current project impacts development of seven specific upper-division courses: (1) \"Introduction to Scientific Computing\" introduces computer-assisted mathematics and computer interfacing at the sophomore level; (2 and 3) \"Intermediate Laboratory I & II\" teaches interfacing, experimental, and analysis methods through application to well-defined junior level experiments; (4) \"Advanced Laboratory\" acquaints students with research grade instrumentation in open-ended, application oriented experiments; (5 and 6) \"Computational Physics I & 1P' emphasizes numerical methods and modeling ; and (7) \"Undergraduate research' demands creative application of all aspects of the preceding courses. Key deliverables, include Mathcad and Science Workshop based multimedia courseware that are designed to progressively develop students' critical thinking, problem solving skills, and experience with computers and instrumentation. Dissemination of courseware, together with its implementation and evaluation, will follow a multifaceted approach previously used for our earlier instructional curriculum, including potential publication in cooperation with MathSoft, the producers of Mathcad.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
