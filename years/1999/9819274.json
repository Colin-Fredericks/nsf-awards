 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis research seeks to examine how state repression influences dissidents and dissident activity.  In order to accomplish this objective, I identify inter-group relations without overt repression being observed, that is, the nature of group communication, planning/carrying through different activities, and so forth.  This information is obtained from reading/coding police (\"Red Squad\") files about a group called the Republic of New Africa (RNA) that was observed weekly from 1968 to 1975.  This information is supplemented by newspaper reports from four different newspapers which vary in terms of ethnicity and political orientation.  The construction of these five data sets facilitates examination within the \"black box\" of a social movement, identifying what happens within them on a weekly basis.  The data sets also facilitate examination of what (if anything) changes when repressive behavior is directed against dissidents.  Finally, the research allows us to understand better how each of the data sources themselves might be biased in terms of what they do and do not report.  As a consequence, the research proposal contributes simultaneously to several areas of research.",
