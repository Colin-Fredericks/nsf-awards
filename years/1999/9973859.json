 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is the development and implementation of a new computational method for determining the lowest energy magnetic configurations of materials. Current methods for determining magnetic ground states are inefficient, requiring calculations for a range of trial spin arrangements (ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, etc.) and subsequent selection of the state with the lowest energy. The method under study is expected to obtain the magnetic ground state from calculations for a single, non-magnetic structure, using a spin-polarized extension of density functional perturbation theory. The approach is based on existing techniques for determining the structural ground states of materials within the density functional framework. Preliminary analytical work has indicated feasibility. A primary goal is the development of a spin-polarized extension to density functional perturbation theory, which will enable first-principles study of the response functions of magnetic materials. \r\n%%% \r\nThis is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The materials theory research project will contribute materials science knowledge at a fundamental level applicable to a variety of materials; new methodology and computer code is expected to be broadly applicable to a variety of materials research issues. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). \r\n***\r\n",
