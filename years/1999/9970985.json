University of California, San Diego\r\nCoping with Software Change Using Information Transparency\r\n\r\nSoftware engineers attempt to design software so that it can be extended, replaced, or modified in small units called modules.  Shortcomings of traditional modularity mechanisms often result in non-localized ``aspects'' requiring global change.  Engineers often overcome this problem in modular design by using the textual or syntactic similarity of the code to be modified to  economically search for and display the dispersed elements.  A design that facilitates such identification is called ``information transparent''.  This research develops a theoretical and practical understanding of information transparency to increase its power and applicability.  In particular, an in-depth analysis of a large, modern system is elucidating how programmers currently maintain their complex, interwoven structures.  The research is also developing tools that are ``aspect aware'', enabling programmers to treat dispersed aspects more like traditional module structures.  Lastly, experiments are being conducted on these tools in the development and maintenance of a complex system.  Together these provide foundations, techniques, and tools for the improved management of complex software system structures.  The research is also providing research training for several graduate students, disseminating practical results to undergraduate and graduate students in classes, and disseminating the tools via the Internet.\r\n",
