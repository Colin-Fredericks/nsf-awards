 "awd_abstract_narration": "9820477\r\nUniversity of Colorado \r\nProfessor William B. Krantz\t\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks funds to continue the NSF-REU Site Program that has been administered for the past six years in the Department of  Chemical Engineering at the University of Colorado.  The focus of this NSF-REU program is membrane and thin film science, which has been identified as a \r\ncritical need in an NSF Workshop report, three NRC reports, and by a past AICHE President.     \r\nAs such, the students participating in this REU Site Program work on research associated with \r\nthe NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Separations Using Thin Films \r\n(CSTF) for which the PI is Co-Founder and Co-Director.  Both Co-Directors are award winning \r\neducators who have extensive experience in mentoring undergraduate research programs.  The \r\nprincipal objective of this Site Program is to encourage promising students, in particular women, \r\nminority, and physically disadvantaged students, to go on to graduate school in order to pursue careers in engineering research.  The students to be accepted into this program and the intended \r\nimpact can be best judged from the statistics and outcomes of our prior NSF-REU Site Program.  \r\nDuring the past six years, 770 students applied to our NSF-REU Site Program.  REU wards \r\nwere made to 73 students (9.5%), 63 of whom (86%) were from schools other than the \r\nUniversity of Colorado (CU).  University and State supported the 10 CU REU students\r\nmatching funds; hence, all NSF funds during the past six years have gone to support REU students \r\nfrom schools other than CU.  Our REU participants included 35 women (48%) and 14 minorities \r\n(19%).  The average GPA of our participants during the past three years ,Nas 3.79/4.00. Our REU \r\nstudents have co-authored 12 published papers (10 peer-review) and 13 presented papers.  An \r\naggressive effort by the Co-Directors resulted in a 96% response rate (25 out of 26 possible) to a \r\nfollow-up survey taken at the end of the academic year following the students' participation in our \r\n1996 and 1997 REU Site Programs.  This survey indicated that 16 of these respondees went on to \r\ngraduate school (2 are still completing BS degrees).  The evaluation taken at the end of our 1998 \r\nten-week summer program indicated that it excited interest in graduate studies by all 14 participants.  \r\nWe seek to continue this very successful program for three more years.  Our proposed REU Site Program involves participation by 81% (13 out of 16) of our faculty in Chemical Engineering.  It \r\nincludes the following enhancements and novel features: (1) expansion from 11 to 15 REU students; \r\n(2) an REU Student Posters Competition to encourage students to present their REU research \r\nat subsequent technical meetings; (3) provision to pay travel expenses for REU students to present a \r\npaper on their research at a technical meeting; (4) an enhanced recruiting program for women and \r\nminorities that utilizes links to appropriate web sites (identified in this proposal); (5) a seminar \r\nprogram that focuses on preparing students to do research; (6) a meaningful program of social and \r\ncultural activities that is designed to complement the research activities; and (7) an effective program \r\nevaluation form and highly successful follow-up survey to gauge the effectiveness of this program.  The University and State of Colorado (through our CSTF Center) are supporting this proposal with \r\na total matching commitment of $126,640 amounting to 44% of the funds being requested from \r\nNSF; this includes a real-money (cash) contribution of $70,222.\r\n",
