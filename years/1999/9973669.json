 "awd_abstract_narration": "This POWRE study will elicit preferences over income distribution from groups of subjects recruited to participate in controlled laboratory experiments. Recently, the assumption of self-interest, and particularly the interpretation that self-interest leads to payoff-maximization, has been challenged as behavior observed in experiments have consistently indicated a willingness to\r\nforego earnings in order to affect payoffs to others.  Not all experiments have shown non payoff-maximizing behavior, however. A baseline experiment by the PI and a collaborator stands in stark contrast to other experimental findings: they found an overwhelming absence of non payoff-maximization. Beginning from this baseline study, the research will systematically vary conditions to reflect properties employed in other experiments. This will enable the determination of conditions under which non payoff-maximizing choices emerge. The research will focus on questions of symmetry in power over affecting final distributions, the effect on perceptions of equity from assigning initial income positions based on considerations of either productivity or effort (i.e. the potential sources of perceived property rights), and the size of the group for which the distribution will apply. Data for analyzing the relationship between payoff-maximizing choices and these contexts will be provided by controlled laboratory experiments.\r\n\r\nThe central place that self-interest and payoff-maximization hold in economic theory makes it important to identify the causes of non payoff-maximizing choices in previous experiments. The purpose is to elicit preferences under an array of systematically imposed conditions, in order to build a bridge between experiments that have found payoff-maximizing behavior and experiments that have found non payoff-maximizing behavior. A deeper understanding of the causes of\r\nindividuals' perceptions of fairness will emerge from the study of the roles of property rights and power.\r\n\r\nThe POWRE funding will give the PI a unique opportunity to establish a major research program that will re-install her as an active and more prominent researcher in the field of behavioral and experimental economics. The timing of the funding is important to the success of the PI in the field. Due to family commitments she has not been able to maintain visibility in the field by\r\nparticipating in conferences for the last several years, but with a child now of an age that allows her more time away from home this constraint is now removed. In addition, the awarding of an instrumentation grant, jointly with Dave Willer in sociology in 1998, gives her the laboratory capacity to pursue higher volume research. The POWRE funding will add the crucial ingredient of an independent research program which will allow the PI to gain prominence, visibility, and influence in the field. \r\n\r\n",
