 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aims of this project are to translate the medieval mathematical manuscript, \"Maaseh Hoshev,\" and to prepare educational materials based on the translation.  Translating such manuscripts uncovers the continuity of mathematical thought during the 900 years between the Greeks and the Renaissance.   The \"Maaseh Hoshev,\" (literally translated as \"the art of calculation\") is a paradigm of fourteenth-century mathematics.  It contains theorems on algebraic identities and sums, algorithms for arithemtic and extraction of square and cube roots, and the earliest known proofs of certain combinatorial theorems.  Although the author of this manuscript is considered by some to be the greatest scientist of his generation, a complete translation of this work has never appeared.  In the Course of this project the work will be translated into English, accompanied by an interpretive introduction, and work on a critical edition  will be begun.",
