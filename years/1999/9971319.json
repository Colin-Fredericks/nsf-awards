In topology, the K-groups\r\nhouse many invariants associated to spaces with fundamental group G.\r\nOne modern approach is through the study of so-called assembly maps.\r\nThey relate the computable homology of the group G to it K-theory.  The\r\nisomorphism conjecture asserts that the assembly maps are isomorphisms\r\nin all dimensions when the group has no torsion elements.  The\r\ninvestigator will verify this for many groups that appear in geometry\r\nand geometric group theory.  The method is to refine current techniques\r\nwhenever they show such maps are injective and to use this refinement\r\nto prove surjectivity.  In another direction, the investigator will\r\ndevelop techniques to handle more groups with combinatorial rather\r\ngeometric prescriptions.\r\n     One of the primary problems in topology is the classification of\r\ntopological manifolds.  An n-dimensional manifold is a space that locally\r\nlooks like n-dimensional Euclidean space.  Examples are spheres, tori,\r\nand other spaces often associated to such useful mathematical objects as\r\nsolutions to differential equations.  The most feasible approach is to\r\nclassify manifolds within large subclasses known as homotopy classes,\r\nclassification of such larger classes being the major goal of algebraic\r\ntopology.  Research of the investigator is directed toward resolution of\r\nthe Borel rigidity conjecture, the simplest solution to this classification\r\nproblem.  The conjecture asserts that a certain natural type of manifold\r\n(technically, a compact manifold with a contractible cover) is unique\r\nwithin its homotopy class.  If true, this rigidity, together with the\r\neffective ways to compare the homotopy classes in most relevant geometric\r\nsituations, will result in a practical classification of these important\r\nmanifolds.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
