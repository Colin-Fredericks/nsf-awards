Specifically, the focus will be on imaging \r\nelectrical conductivity and permittivity of a medium, given low frequency \r\nelectro-magnetic field measurements. Such inverse problems are highly \r\nnonlinear and pose difficult analytical and computational questions. The \r\nresearch goal is to build a coherent set of algorithms and analytic tools for \r\nimaging intermediate and high contrast media, that go beyond the usual \r\nlinearization procedure that is clearly inadequate. Towards this goal, the \r\nfollowing directions of research have been identified: 1) Use state of the \r\nart, minimal variational principles in our algorithms for imaging \r\nintermediate contrast media. 2) Develop imaging algorithms based on our \r\nnew asymptotic studies for time-harmonic electro-magnetic fields in high \r\ncontrast media. 3) Extend the asymptotic theory to problems in linear \r\nelasticity, for media with a high volume fraction of rigid inclusions.\r\n\r\nImaging electrical properties of heterogeneous media finds important \r\napplications in environmental studies such as underground contaminant \r\ndetection. The research focuses on intermediate and high contrast media \r\nbecause of the known fact that the underground electrical conductivity and \r\npermittivity can have large variations, up to orders of magnitude. One \r\npractical way of imaging the shape of fluid plumes underground is to \r\nmake electrical or electro-magnetic measurements on the surface of the \r\nEarth and in boreholes. The data gathered are processed in order to \r\nestimate both the location of underground good conductors and their \r\nmagnitude. A substantial amount of work has been done for the case of \r\nelectrical, d.c. measurements. Comparatively, little work has been done on \r\nthe electro-magnetic inverse problem. Most of the results available apply \r\nto low contrast media. Recently, we have done studies of electro-magnetic \r\nfields in high contrast media and plan to use these studies in inversion. \r\nThe results are promising and should bring significant improvement to the \r\ncurrent stage of available imaging algorithms.\r\n",
