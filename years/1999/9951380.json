 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops two laboratory-based courses on computer network security. The first course is aimed at the senior undergraduate majoring in computer science or computer engineering. The other course will be of short duration with multiple lectures and laboratory exercises per day to run over a period of 3 days. This course is a continuation of the first course and aimed at computer savvy users.  It is expected to be offered in a continuing education format.  Both courses feature guest lectures on legal issues, social responsibility and ethics.\r\n\r\nFifteen laboratory experiments are being developed to be conducted on isolated LANs. These include team projects to strengthen the basic and experimental understanding of firewalls. All the laboratory work is being conducted in a proposed laboratory of PC-clones capable of running both Unix (Linux) and Windows NT/2000. The laboratory setup is being documented thoroughly for use by other institutions planning to offer courses on firewalls. Based upon successful evaluation of the proof-of-concept of the new courses and lab exercises, the lecture notes and lab exercises will be disseminated on a web site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
