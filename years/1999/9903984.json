However, our preliminary investigations indicate that the longer term evolution of fluvially dominated systems in a coastal environment, such as the modern Mississippi River delta plain, are likely significantly influenced by catastrophic events such as Hurricane Georges---particularly on their seaward margins where subdelta growth is occurring and distributaries are prograding. While the response to the storm is evident and will be documented in more detail in this study, the post-storm adjustment phase is not at all understood.  In addition, our understanding of the initial phases of barrier island recovery after severe storms is based primarily on supposition, largely governed by our interpretation of the day-to-day dynamics of coastal systems and associated processes during fairweather and storms of lesser magnitude.  Our primary objective is to quantify and better comprehend the post-storm adjustment of two geomorphologically distinct environments:  an actively building, fluvially dominated, sediment rich environment located in the  Birdsfoot delta, Louisiana and a sediment starved, transgressive system comprised of  Chandeleur Island (Louisiana), West Ship Island (Mississippi) and Santa Rosa Island (Florida) by establishing key monitoring sites that can be reoccupied over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
