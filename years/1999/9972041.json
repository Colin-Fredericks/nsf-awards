Crystalline gallium nitride (GaN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) are two of the most promising wide band-gap III-V semiconductors for short wavelength optoelectronic devices.  A great deal of experimental and theoretical effort has been expended to understand the bulk properties of the crystalline phase of these materials for various applications.  Although amorphous III-V nitrides may be viewed as a by-product of these efforts, they have been the subjects of few theoretical and experimental investigations.  Nevertheless, scientifically, amorphous III-V nitrides should have structural features and properties which are sufficiently different from those of amorphous semiconductors like Si and GaAs, and amorphous insulators like a-SiO2 to justify a detailed investigation.  A systematic study will be done for the vibrational structure of amorphous III-V nitrides, a-GaN, a-AlN, and a-InN.  The primary objective of this work will be a full characterization of the topological and chemical disorder of the amorphous networks and the identification of the structural point defects (like dangling bonds).  Insight will be gained into the vibrational properties of the amorphous III-V nitrides by determining the vibrational densities of states and infrared absorption from first-principles.  For each amorphous network model considered, the frequencies, optical activities, symmetry, degree of localization, and character of the vibrational modes of various structural models will be determined.  The results of this study should be useful in understanding the electronic, vibrational, and optical properties of amorphous III-V nitrides and in interpreting and predicting the results of experimental measurements.  Moreover, this study is an essential first step in elucidating the nature of the short range order, and the structural properties of impurity and defect bonding conformations which may characterize the structure of amorphous III-V nitrides.\r\n%%% \r\nThis is a grant for Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) which focuses on the vibrational properties of amorphous semiconductors.
