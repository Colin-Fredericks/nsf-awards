Attendees will be assembled to discuss the significance of creating a national database on women in civil engineering, and to develop the framework for such a database.  Through this mechanism, a more efficient and effective method will be available to identify issues and challenges faced by women in engineering, as well as tracking the recruitment and retention of women in civil engineering.  This database will also be able to track the advancement of women in the engineering profession and assist in determining best practices.  The workshop, to be organized in conjunction with the National Academy of Engineers, will result in the establishment of a team of engineering experts who will collectively work toward the creation of a national database on women in all fields of engineering. \r\n\r\n",
