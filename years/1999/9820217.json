Boehm\r\n\r\nA program for research experiences for undergraduates in mechanical engineering at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) is proposed.  The program offers a choice of a broad range of technical research topics to 12 students each year to be performed over a 9 week period in the summer.  In addition to the research experience, a component related to engineering ethics is included for the students during two hours each week.  Students in either their junior or senior years will be selected from a solicitation that will be advertised by direct mailing to schools, as well as other modes to attract students (such as information at miniority engineering and SWE conferences).  The students are selected for the program based upon an expression of interest, academic achievement, qualifications to attend graduate school, and ability to match the student's technical interest with faculty expertise.",
