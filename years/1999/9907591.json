This biannual meeting is jointly sponsored by nine societies, totaling over 2,000 members in the societies as a whole, each represented according to their membership strengths in a series of symposia devoted to current research in biological rhythms. The meeting is formatted to foster unique opportunities for dialogue and intellectual exchange between student and faculty researchers. A special student program will provide \"Topic Tables\" at a student-faculty informal luncheon designed to provide the opportunity for small group discussions. Specific topics include methodology of biological rhythms, molecular, cellular and genetic aspects of biological rhythms, regulation of biological rhythms by environmental factors, hormone, melatonin and other substances. Plenary lectures, symposia, datablitz sessions and poster presentations will provide trainees with valuable access to the latest research strategies across a broad range of disciplines.",
