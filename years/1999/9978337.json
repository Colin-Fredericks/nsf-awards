The goal of the GDL is to help faculty find, evaluate, use, and create resources that support active learning in undergraduate Earth System science.  The immediate two-year objective is to: (1) implement a usable version of the library organized around a set of service desks and, (2) establish a sustainable and active community infrastructure which will support, populate, use, and govern the library.  The project will lay the foundation for a comprehensive geoscience digital library linked to other libraries worldwide.  The GDL will be built by a unique collaboration among University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology, Keck Geology Consortium, Earth systems Science Program of the Universities Space Research Association, Center for Lifelong Learning and Design of the University of Colorado, and University of California, Santa Barbara.  This team provides the expertise and leadership required to respond to a series of community calls for an electronic repository of high-quality educational materials.  Together, they will develop, evaluate, and disseminate this library as a national educational resource.  The GDL addresses several needs articulated in the national reports on geoscience education.  One of the primary strengths of the team is its cross-disciplinary nature that supports the emerging Earth systems science approach.  The library will promote equal access to quality educational materials for all students and faculties, including those students in institutions that serve traditionally under-represented populations.  The distribution of \"best practices\" and contemporary pedagogical approaches will be facilitated.  The strengths and productivity of several communities that have not been linked in this manner before will be leveraged.  Finally, GDL will provide access to new materials, such a large data sets that have been previously unavailable to many outside the research-rich institutions.  Contents of the library will be a collection of URL's and metadata that identify large data sets, curricular materials, collections, images, and abstracts.  The project will employ open architecture standards and be based on the current state of research and development in the digital library community.  Mechanisms will be put in place to insure scalability, re-usability, and sustainability.  The library will be dynamic in the sense that faculty will contribute holdings, evaluate those holdings, and be supported in the process of materials development for future holdings.  Resource evaluation materials will be developed, and a community-led discourse process will be established to enable the creation of standardized taxonomies and vocabularies.  An Advisory Board will provide guidance and oversight, and linkages will be made with other groups interested in digital libraries.  Finally, a comprehensive documentation and evaluation process for the project will be instituted.  Advances anticipated from the project are in both the educational and digital library arenas.  Through increased access to quality materials, the project will foster the integration of research into undergraduate education.  New levels of community discussion will result in innovative approaches to Earth systems science that foster student-centered and active learning techniques.  Traditionally under-served populations will have improved access to the tools and methods of scientific inquiry.  For the digital library community, the GDL will implement innovative approaches to classification and demonstrate methodologies and tools that support the community process of federated digital-library development.  The award is made jointly by the Division of Undergraduate Education of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources and the Directorate for Geosciences.\r\n",
