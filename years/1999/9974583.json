 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nPlant-feeding insects have been studied extensively because of their importance as pests in agriculture and forestry.  Despite the large number of studies that have been done on these insects, there are still basic questions regarding their relative abilities to feed successfully on certain plants.  This study will focus on the means by which insects are or are not adapted to feeding on some of the many plants that produce chemicals known as phenolics.\r\n\r\nThis research will determine whether the ability of insects to cope with phenolic-containing plant material depends on the degree of oxidative stress caused by phenolics in their guts.  The detrimental effects of oxidative stress on insects include reduced growth rates and death.  Clearly, protection from oxidative stress is essential to the growth and survival of insects that are adapted to feed on plants that produce pro-oxidant defensive chemicals.  The proposed research focuses on the insect gut because this is the first place in an insect's body in which chemicals that it eats cause harm, and where some of the insect's critical defenses may be found.  This study examines how it is that the adapted species are able to defend themselves successfully from oxidative stress in their guts, and how it is that the non-adapted species differ.  These differences may include the maintenance of high levels of antioxidants inside the gut and/or feeding on plants that contain high levels of antioxidants.  Other differences that will be examined include the production of defensive (antioxidant) enzymes in the gut wall and/or their secretion into the gut lumen.\r\n\r\nUpon completion of the proposed research, the PIs will have a greater understanding of factors that affect host-plant preferences of insect herbivores.  This basic knowledge of how insects function will help the PIs understand ecological and evolutionary relationships between insects and plants, and may have future application in insect pest management.\r\n",
