 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a joint U.S.-Korea Workshop on New Frontiers in Infrastructural and Seismic Engineering.  The funding for the support is provided jointly by the Hazard Reduction Cluster of the CMS Division and the U.S.-Japan Korea Program of the International Division.  Korea and the U.S. have a long-standing record of joint frontier research through bilateral symposia/workshops.  Objectives of this workshop are: 1) to assess the current state of theory and practice in seismic and infrastructural engineering and to foster communication across a diverse engineering disciplines representing theoretical and experimental research as well as design, for a broad range of applications; 2) to stimulate future cooperative research and development in subjects of common interest and importance; 3) to evaluate the results of Korea's civil infrastructure research program and their practical application to U.S. engineering practice, particularly in mitigating natural hazards; and 4) to continue to build the long-term bilateral scientific relationship existing between the academic and practicing professional communities.  Proceedings of the workshop including presentations, highlights of group discussion, and workshop resolutions will be published in book form and distributed to the participants as well as individuals and institutions with an interest in this area.",
