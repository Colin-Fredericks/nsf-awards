 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971922\r\nPhillips\r\n      An important set of problems in the analysis of the thermophysical properties of materials \r\nsurround the question of how to base this analysis on an understanding of the underlying defect mechanisms taking place within a material.  For example, in the context of plastic deformation, though it is well known that plasticity is often mediated by the motion of dislocations, as yet, the goal of constructing models of plasticity based directly on the physics of dislocations has been largely unfulfilled.  Part of the reason for this is the operation in problems of this sort of multiple length and time scales.  The work proposed \r\nhere has two key thrusts: 1) the development of new computational tools for the investigation of problems involving a hierarchy of length and time scales and 2) the application of these hierarchical tools to the analysis of the nucleation, motion and interaction of dislocations.  Our methodological work will center on the extension of the quasicontinuum method to three-dimensions with a full capability for carrying out dynamical simulations at finite temperature and including both mesh refinement and mesh coarsening.  The application of these ideas to the physics of dislocations will include an analysis of the kinetics of dislocation motion and the strength of junctions\r\n",
