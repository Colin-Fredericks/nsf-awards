 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1999 FASEB Summer Research Conference on Genetic Recombination and Genome \r\nRearrangements will be held August 7-12, 1999, in Snowmass, Colorado.  The program includes eight plenary sessions featuring speakers who are at the forefront of biochemical, molecular and genetic studies of homologous, site-specific and nonhomologous recombination.  Homologous recombination is an important DNA repair mechanism and also is generally essential for the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes in meiosis.  Site-specific recombination is the mechanism underlying most programmed genome rearrangements and thus is important in controlling gene expression.  Finally, nonhomologous recombination also constitutes an important DNA repair mechanism (nonhomologous end joining) and is the mechanism whereby most transposition occurs. The major topics of the plenary sessions will be: recombination mechanisms, eukaryotic recombination, recombination and DNA replication, recombination and DNA repair, site-specific recombination, genome rearrangements, meiotic processes, and recombination structures.  Recombination systems operating in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are included in the program, and emphasis will be placed on areas where knowledge is rapidly developing and where methodologies can be widely exploited.  In addition to the plenary sessions, informal interactions will be fostered through poster sessions and ad hoc workshops.  This particular conference occupies a unique niche within the recombination field in that it focuses exclusively on recombination and productively brings together the diverse experiences and insights represented within the field.  NSF funds will be used to support student travel and participation in the meeting.\r\n",
