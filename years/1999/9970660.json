Michael Christ\r\n\r\nAbstract: This research will focus on problems in harmonic analysis, subelliptic partial differential equations, and spectral theory. A circle of problems related to the interplay between curvature, finite type conditions, Lebesgue-space norm inequalities, precise smoothing properties of Radon-like transforms, oscillation, sizes of images of mappings, and sublevel sets will be investigated. Those aspects of partial differential equations to be investigated concern subelliptic operators, and the d-bar Neumann problem for smoothly bounded domains. Long-term goals include a deeper understanding of global regularity and irregularity, and of analytic hypoellipticity. The possible relevance of a certain metric in phase space to these issues will be further studied. Lastly, the existence of absolutely continuous spectra for Schroedinger operators with slowly decaying potentials, and the asymptotic behavior of generalized eigenfunctions in dimensions greater than one will be explored. Multilinear analysis will be applied to this problem, and space-time estimates of an as yet undetermined nature will be sought.\r\n\r\nFundamental physical laws are often formulated in terms of partial differential equations. The mathematician's task is to analyze such equations and their solutions, which generally cannot be computed explicitly, and moreover to develop general techniques useful in such analyses. The harmonic analyst, in particular, seeks to combine dual time/space and frequency analysis to gain insight into issues such as the possible singularities of solutions or eigenfunctions, how such singularities reflect the structure of the underlying differential equation or linear operator, and what properties of the operator \r\ninfluence singularities or asymptotic behavior. In particular, curvature in various guises plays an important role for hyperbolic partial differential equations, and for geometry in complex space. This research project focuses on a number of interrelated fundamental questions concerning harmonic analysis and its applications to partial differential equations and to spectral theory, in which curvature and time/frequency analysis play leading roles. The aim is to develop basic methods of analysis, through the investigation of several concrete problems, that may lead to a better understanding of underlying mathematical phenomena and, ultimately, of any physical laws that the mathematics \r\n",
