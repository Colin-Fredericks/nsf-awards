 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the superfluid phases of atomic nuclei in which each Cooper pair is composed of one neutron and one proton.  In one superfluid phase the neutron and proton are coupled to isospin T = 1 and  intrinsic spin S =0.  In another superfluid phase the neutron and proton are coupled to T = 0 and S = 1.  These phases should be most likely to occur in nuclei which have approximately equal numbers of neutrons and protons.  There are also superfluid phases in which each Cooper pair is composed of two neutrons or two protons.  These pairs have T = 1 and S = 0.  All of these different superfluid phases can co-exist in the same nucleus and in the same wave-function.  Calculations on medium mass nuclei near the N = Z line will search for these exotic np superfluids.  Calculations will determine how the np superfluids depend on neutron excess N - Z, temperature, and spin.  The project will investigate transitions in the shapes of atomic nuclei at high temperatures.  Calculations on medium mass nuclei will search for isotopes where rotation of a hot spherical shape generates a hot prolate shape rotating around its symmetry axis.  These calculations will search for the second critical shape transition temperature at which the prolate shape rotating about its symmetry axis turns into an oblate shape rotating about its symmetry axis.\r\n",
