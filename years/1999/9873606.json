All known FTHFSs are homologous; however, in many eukaryotes\r\nFTHFS is a part of trifunctional C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase while in\r\nbacteria it is a separate enzyme. The mechanism of FTHFS has been studied\r\nfor almost three decades but in the absence of information about its\r\nthree-dimensional structure the progress has been limited. Of particular\r\ninterest is the role of monovalent cations in catalysis, the comparison of\r\nthe folate-binding site with those present in other enzymes. The enzyme of\r\ninterest is from thermophilic bacteria and the structural origins of\r\nthermostability will be analyzed.\r\n\r\nThis study is based on previous studies with 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate\r\nsynthetase from Clostridium thermoaceticum.  Earlier work determined the\r\ncDNA and amino acid sequence, expressed the enzyme in E. coli, purified and\r\ncrystallized the recombinant native and selenomethionine forms of the\r\nenzyme. Multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data were collected to\r\n2.5 A resolution from the Se-Met crystals. Positions of anomalous\r\nscatterers were determined using direct methods and the results used to\r\nsolve the phase problem. A model of the molecule was built and optimized\r\nusing crystallographic refinement. Further studies will be directed towards\r\nthe determination of the structures of the enzyme in the form of complexes\r\nwith the substrates/catalytic intermediates, and inhibitors. Based on\r\nstructural data, the catalytic role of side chains present in the active\r\nsite will be elucidated. The hypotheses so generated will be tested using\r\nsite-directed mutagenesis.\r\n",
