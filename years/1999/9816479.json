 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference is to bring together the world leaders\r\nof mathematicians with interests in nonlinear\r\npartial differential equations.  We will focus on nonlinear \r\nelliptic equations, motions of surfaces, fluids dynamics  \r\nand equations from mathematical physics.  We expect  \r\nthe meeting to be a place in which many discussions and \r\ncollaborations are initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost all physical phenomena, such as those in Quantum Mechanics,\r\nFluid Mechanics and Superconductivity, are described in mathematical\r\nterms by partial differential equations.\r\nOne theory of high temperature superconductor can be described by \r\na nonlinear elliptic equation. Analysis of this equation\r\nwill lead us to a better understanding of the physical phenomena.\r\nIn the  last year of the 20th century, it is a good time to focus \r\nour minds on what we have accomplished and on new challenges\r\nthat will face us in the next century.  The aim of this conference is \r\nto review the progress and, more importantly, to discuss new challenges\r\nand new applications of  nonlinear partial differential equations\r\n",
