 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1994 the University of Florida Department of Chemistry established a new accelerated undergraduate course sequence, called Chemtrak, to provide an enhanced curriculum for 30-50 high caliber entering freshmen students.  These students typically enter with two or more years of high school chemistry and are highly motivated and prepared for more advanced material.  With a major instrumental emphasis, the syllabus of Chemtrak has evolved into a series of spectroscopic measurements involving emission, absorption and fluorescence of atoms and molecules.  Major instrumentation includes a variety of monochromators, spectrometers, lasers, burner assemblies, and optical components available in the department.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the integration of computer-based spectrometers into the Chemtrak laboratory. The design of this laboratory is adapted from the work at Wake Forest University (NSF-DUE 9251294) where the modular approach of using computer-based spectrometry in the undergraduate curriculum has been proven successful in introducing spectrometric practice and theory to undergraduate students. In our adaptation of this work, five compact computer-based spectrometers with charge coupled device (CCD) detectors and laptop computers are integrated into the Chemtrak experimental curriculum. Students can observe the entire spectral region from 350-1000 nm and acquire large amounts of data for subsequent evaluation on their home computers. The added versatility of these small spectrometers permits more experiments to be completed, and more detailed and sophisticated measurements to be performed.  This is found to greatly enhance the educational impact of this course.\r\n\r\n",
