A clear manifestation of these inputs is increased concentrations of nitrate, a potential pollutant, in surface and groundwater throughout the U.S.  Understanding nutrient dynamics in headwater streams is an essential part of understanding how rivers will respond to increased anthropogenic inputs of nitrate. The hyporheic zone (the region of mixing between surface water and groundwater) has recently been recognized as an important component of stream ecosystems, especially in headwater streams.  Through their metabolic activities, microorganisms which live in the hyporheic zone can temporarily or permanently retain nitrate and prevent it from traveling downstream.  This research quantifies the contribution of the hyporheic zone to nitrate retention in 3 headwater streams and investigates the relationship between this retention and rates of ecosystem metabolism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
