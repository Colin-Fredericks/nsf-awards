 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for wireless access to data is widely cited.  However, unlike the geometric growth of cellular (voice) wireless, wireless data has languished.  There are many possible reasons, but the most striking is one of high cost.  It therefore makes sense to reconsider some of the basic assumptions about wireless systems such as fixed proprietary infrastructure and licensed bandwidth which tend to raise the costs.  Specifically, there is a need to understand at a fundamental level how systems can peacefully coexist when they mutually interfere in unlicensed bands (such as the recently allocated 5GHz U-NII bands) and may even co-inhabit the same areas.  Thus, the proposed work will carefully explore an extremely simple design precept for use in such seemingly chaotic multi-system environments -- adjust transmitted waveforms and reception techniques to avoid interference -- \"interference avoidance\" for short.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the emergence of programmable digital radios prompts the consideration of wireless systems comprised of elements which can vary both their output waveforms and received-signal processing.  It has already been shown that ensembles of adaptive transmitters communicating synchronously with a single receiver can OPTIMIZE their use of the wireless medium by practicing interference avoidance.  The proposed work will deepen and extend the theoretical understanding of interference avoidance by considering asynchronous systems, dispersive channels, multi-element antenna arrays and probably most important, systems with multiple receivers.  At each juncture, information theoretic bounds will be sought since these provide clear bounds on performance.  In addition, practicalities such as convergence speed, quantization effects, channel measurements and systems level issues will be also considered.  \r\n",
