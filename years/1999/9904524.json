 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant unsolved problem in cell biology is to understand how cytoplasmically synthesized proteins are targeted to the various compartments of eukaryotic cells.  In plant cells, chloroplasts offer an excellent system for studying this problem.  Most chloroplastic proteins are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytoplasm as higher molecular weight precursors, and imported posttranslationally across the two envelope membranes.  The long-term goal of this research program is to understand the molecular details of chloroplastic protein import.  Two specific hypotheses will be tested in the current work regarding the details of this process.  The first is that Hsp93, a stromal molecular chaperone in the Hsp100 family of proteins, provides the driving force for the transport of precursor proteins across the two envelope membranes.  Two strategies will be used to evaluate this hypothesis.  The first will be to establish in vitro assays using purified chaperone proteins and purified precursor proteins to determine whether any of the events that are predicted to occur during protein translocation can be measured in vitro.  The major focus will be on interactions between Hsp93 and precursor proteins, however the possible involvement of partner proteins will also be investigated.  Finally, the ATPase activity of Hsp93 will be measured in an attempt to understand the role of energy in supporting the chaperone cycle that presumably drives protein import.  The second strategy will be to perform reverse genetics to either delete or make changes in Hsp93 and attempt to determine the effects of these mutations both in vivo and in vitro.  The second hypothesis to be evaluated is that a GTP cycle operates early in the import process, possibly contributing to the specificity needed during the recognition of precursor proteins.  Because of the limitations of current in vitro assays, the strategy to be used for the near term will be that of reverse genetics to generate plants either lacking the GTP-binding proteins that are part of the receptor complex in the outer envelope membrane or with alterations in these proteins.  The goal of these studies will be to evaluate whether such a GTP cycle exists and to determine its importance for the protein import process.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding protein import into chloroplasts is important for at least two reasons.  First, it adds to our understanding of a basic cellular process, i.e. intracellular protein trafficking.  Significant discoveries regarding protein trafficking within eukaryotic cells have been made in the last two decades.  Because the components of the chloroplastic protein import apparatus have no sequence similarity to components from the mitochondrial and ER transport systems, it is hypothesized that the chloroplast system evolved independently.  If correct, then clarifying the details of protein transport into chloroplasts and comparing them with other intracellular transport systems should reveal important features of protein trafficking systems that have been selected independently during convergent evolution.  Second, understanding protein import into chloroplasts has practical significance for efforts to employ genetic engineering to alter the many metabolic processes that occur in chloroplasts.  Successful modifications of plant metabolism requires not only that new genetic information be introduced into the nucleus and expressed at the proper time, but also that gene products be targeted to their proper locations within cells.  Thus, understanding protein targeting to plastids has considerable practical significance.\r\n\r\n   \r\n",
