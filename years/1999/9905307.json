 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis project is an aggregate data collection and analysis to advance understanding of women's voting behavior in the 1920s and early 1930s.  Using Gary King's (1997) proposed solution to the problem of ecological inference, estimates are obtained for turnout and vote choice of women in thirteen states for five presidential election years (1916-1932).  City-level, ward-level and, for 1930, minor civil division (MCD-level) census data on gender, race, nativity, age, literacy, and marital status are collected.  The data are merged with election returns for presidential elections and any Senate, House, and gubernatorial elections in each presidential election year.  Models of turnout and vote choice are developed and refined by evaluating estimates obtained using King's method with true values for the State of Illinois (where votes were recorded by gender in several elections).  Model estimates permit new information to be brought to bear vis-a-vis a number of outstanding questions regarding the incorporation of women into the electorate:  the success or failure of party mobilization efforts directed toward women, the importance of race, age, nativity, and education, and the role of contextual factors in shaping women's turnout and vote choice.  More generally, this research clarifies the role of women's enfranchisement in declining rates of electoral turnout in the 1920s, and in the New Deal realignment of the late 1920s and early 1930s.  In addtion to the substantive questions, the project offers a challenging and real test for King's method of ecological inference.  Estimates are obtained from several levels of aggregation and from several different model specifications to evaluate the utility of King's method for recovering the observed Illinois outcomes.  Finally, census and electoral data and the estimated vote choice and turnout for men and women are made readily accessible to the broader research community interested in questions of voting behavior and party politics in the early part of the twentieth century.",
