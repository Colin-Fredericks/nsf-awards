Subfactors with finite Jones index have an amazingly rich mathematical structure and an interplay of analytical, algebraic-combinatorial and topological techniques is intrinsic to the theory. Planar algebra methods will be used to investigate the structure of subfactors and their standard invariants. In pioneering work, Bisch and Jones have used these techniques to prove a general structure theorem for subfactors that leads to a classification of singly generated planar algebras with small dimension.  It is planned to take this classification one step further by studying a generalized quantum Yang-Baxter equation. New towers of algebras are expected to appear in this analysis. The notion of free product of two planar algebras will be investigated and various natural graded algebra structures on a planar algebra will be examined. Other directions of the project include work on rigidity of subfactors and the investigation of sub-systems of Popa systems.\r\n\r\nThe theory of operator algebras, of which subfactor theory is a branch, has been introduced by John von Neumann to provide an adequate mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. For instance, the Heisenberg uncertainty relation appears as a natural consequence of the properties of the abstract mathematical objects that von Neumann invented. It has become increasingly clear in the last few years that classical mathematical structures, such as groups, are not always sufficient to capture all the relevant symmetries present in a mathematical or physical situation, especially in the context of quantum field theory. A subfactor can be viewed as a mathematical object with which one can capture what one might call the quantum symmetries of the problem under investigation. Subfactor techniques can then be applied to describe these symmetries explicitly in algebraic-combinatorial terms.  For instance, certain graphs appear as part of this data. Many surprising applications of the theory of subfactors to several areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, for instance knot theory and conformal field theory, have been found in this way. Subfactors have thus contributed in an important way to the understanding of naturally occurring structures in these a priori quite distinct areas of mathematics and physics.\r\n",
