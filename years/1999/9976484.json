At the same time, the exponential increase of semiconductor manufacture costs as device technology shrinks below this critical feature size mandates an increased dependence on simulation prior to manufacture. Important issues which will occur as devices continue to shrink include full three-dimensional geometry effects, new material systems, random dopant effects, discrete electron charging effects, and ultimately quantum mechanical effects at the smallest dimensions.\r\nHerein is proposed funding for a three year program of research with the goal of developing the necessary device simulation tools to meet the challenges of device scaling along the projected Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) roadmap and beyond with special attention given to the requirements of modularity, robustness and reliability. These device tools will employ full-band Cellular Automata and Monte Carlo particle-based techniques developed under previous NSF funding for efficient solution of the semi-classical Boltzmann transport equation and beyond. These techniques will be combined with robust field solvers based on multi-grid and Bi-conjugate gradient stabilized methods including non-uniform grids for arbitrary two- and three-dimensional device geometries. Discrete impurity effects and intercarrier interactions will be included in this simulation level through a coupled mesh/particle force model to assess the fluctuation in device operating characteristics based on random impurity distributions. Collaboration with industrial partners will be undertaken for comparison and calibration with state of the art device technologies. Due to the computational demands of 3D semi-classical modeling, the proposed research will be supported by investigation of high-performance computing environments based on multi-processor systems, and clusters of workstations. Distributed algorithms for both the transport simulation tools and the coupled field solvers will be developed and applied for high-end computing as developed under previous funding.\r\nWe will focus on comparison and calibration of the simulation tools with three particular technology areas in collaboration with industry and experimental groups, although the scope of the project goes far beyond these. One area involves EEPROM device technology, where 3D effects are prevalent, and where elevated electric fields necessitate full-band consideration as well. Another effort will focus on scaled Si MOS devices below 0.1 gm gate length, where a variety of new problems arise in terms of device scaling. Finally, we will consider newer material systems such as SOI and Si/SiGe technology, where little is known for example about hole transport, and improved transport models including full-band effects' are necessary.\r\n***\r\n",
