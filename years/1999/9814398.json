Yet, while the phase behavior of either amphiphiles or colloids has been extensively investigated, our understanding of mixed system is, to date, incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study is to derive a systematic phase diagram of two general amphiphile-particle systems (i) Aggregates formed by uncharged, hydrophobic, particles with non-ionic ampphiphiles, and (ii) Mixtures of charged colloids wit oppositely charged amphiphiles.\r\n\r\nA model for the phase diagram will de developed which will predict the type of aggregate formed as a function of the amphiphile molecular characteristics, particle geometry (spherical or rod-like), particle size, the concentrations of the different components and, in that case systems, the solution ionic strength.  Scaling and self-consistent field models for the amphiphiles will be combined with the Debye Hukel or Poisson-Boltzmann equation and Monte-Carlo simulations for the electrostatics.  This approach has been found to be quite successful in several preliminary studies (Dan, Biophys. J., 1996, 1997, Biophysica et Biochimica Acta, 1998, Dan and Safran, Biophys. J. 1998).\r\n\r\nExperiments on model amphiphile-particle mixtures will be conducted in collaborations with E.  Kaler of the University of Delaware, D. Weitz of the University of Pennsylvania, and Y. Talmon from the Technion, IIT in Haifa, Israel.  All three groups specialize in the study of complex fluids in general, and the phase behavior of colloids and amphiphiles in particular. The techniques used include electron micrscopy and cryo-electron microscopy, small angle X-ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering.\r\n\r\nThe combined theoretical and experimental studies will provide systematic understanding of the processes controlling self-assembly in heterogeneous mixtures, namely, amphiphiles and particles.  Such an understanding is critical for the rationale design of new materials that can accomplish specific performance parameters\r\n",
