The LASER-M/S project is a partnership between the Fayette County Public School District and the University of Kentucky.  The planning will include the development of professional development opportunities for teachers in mathematics and science using the following NSF-supported programs:  Investigations in Number, Data, and Space; the Full Option Science System(FOSS); Science Curriculum Improvement Study; and Science Education for Public Education Program (SEPUP).  Support for this planning will include consultants working with project staff from the University of Kentucky and the Education Development Center.  The planning effort will also allow for the development of pilot sites that will later serve as models for other schools.  Finally, project staff will gather, develop, and field-test instruments that assess teachers' understanding of mathematics and science, their attitudes toward mathematics and science, their teaching effectiveness, and their students' learning of mathematics and science.  These instruments will later be used in the systemic initiative.",
