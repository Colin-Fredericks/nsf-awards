 "awd_abstract_narration": "9900280\r\nGearheart\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research project is to develop a new polarization-agile wire antenna element. A new four-terminal wire antenna geometry is proposed along with novel methods of tuning the resonant frequency, impedance, and radiation pattern of the antenna. The four terminal antenna can radiate in one of two modes: dipole mode or slot mode. Ideally, the radiation patterns and resonant frequencies of the two modes are identical and their polarizations are orthogonal in every direction. Furthermore, each terminal should see a matched impedance to the coaxial feed to reduce system reflections. Superposition of the two modes will allow for the synthesis of any linear, circular, or elliptical polarization, and identical mode radiation patterns and orthogonal mode polarizations will allow for synthesis of any polarization in any direction. The novel integrated tuning stubs will allow the polarization-agile wire antenna to radiate each mode effectively at multiple specified frequencies. Genetic algorithm optimization techniques will be used in the development of the polarization-agile multiple-resonant wire antenna.\r\n\r\nThe proposed polarization-agile wire antenna element will allow for significant improvement in smart antenna systems through inclusion of optimized polarization information. This represents a significant improvement over traditional polarization diversity systems that use two perpendicular antennas and use the strongest signal from one antenna or the other. Such antennas are not orthogonally polarized for all angles of arrival and the singular use of one antenna or the other does not allow for the synthesis of circular or elliptical polarization.\r\n\r\nA national resource for the education of high school and undergraduate students on the design and measurement of antennas and microwave circuits is proposed. An internet site devoted the education of high school and undergraduate students is the key component of the proposal. The goals of the internet site are as follows:\r\n\r\nIntroduce high school and undergraduate students to the fields of antennas and\r\nmicrowave circuits through design examples, measurement demonstrations, and real-time antenna radiation pattern measurements.\r\nProvide a supplement for undergraduate microwave and antenna textbooks used in senior-level undergraduate courses nationwide.\r\nTarget inner city (e.g. minority) high school students in Milwaukee through the\r\noffering of wireless data and voice network services.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a summer research program for undergraduate student researchers from institutions with large percentages of underrepresented minority groups will help increase the number of such students that successfully complete a degree in Electrical Engineering and encourage those students to consider graduate degrees in Electrical Engineering.\r\n\r\n",
