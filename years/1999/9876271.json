At the lowest level, we know that the basic computational units of the brain are nerve cells, or neurons. We also know that neurons use electrical impulses called \"action potentials\" to communicate with each other. What we do not know is how these impulses code information, for instance, the representation of the organism's environment.  A common view is that properties of perceived objects are coded as the average firing rates of neurons (\"rate code\") but this is not only an inefficient procedure, it also creates problems when the brain has to deal with more than one object simultaneously, as is usually the case. One of the problems is that, if a certain property is coded by a corresponding spike rate, and if several objects have this property, how does one decide to which of those objects the property belongs?\r\n\r\nThe brain does more than just map out the external world; the behavior of an organism also depends on its internal states. One of the problems the brain has to solve is information overload, resulting from the multitude of stimuli impinging on the sensors at all times. Therefore, one of the brain's most important functions is to carefully select those stimuli that are important, and to consider only these in detail. For instance, while you are reading this text, you are focusing on the written words and you are probably not thinking about how your left foot feels in your left shoe. However, now that you try to \"feel\" it, you can \"pay attention\" to it. We know that the tactile sensors in your foot behave the same way whether you are paying attention to it or not, but for the brain the two situations are clearly different. What, precisely, changes in the activity of the brain when you direct your attention from one stimulus to another?\r\n\r\nTheoretical models have predicted that the code used by the brain not only uses the average rate but also more fine-grained temporal structures of the sequences of action impulses. For instance, it has been predicted that paying attention does not necessarily change the average firing rate, but the relations between the firing in different neurons, for instance, make it more likely that neurons fire together. Dr. Niebur and his students will compare the activity of neurons in monkeys performing a task that requires them to attend to a stimulus with the activity when they receive the same stimulation but are NOT attending to it. Preliminary results, as well as mathematical modeling, have indicated that there is indeed, such a difference in the relative firing of neurons. In addition to analyzing the neural activity of the monkey working on the task, they will also develop mathematical models of attentional processing.\r\n",
