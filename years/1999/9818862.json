NCTM administers the grant program and provides approximately 40 travel grants to key elementary, middle and high school teachers and supervisors, community college and college/university mathematics teachers, teacher educators and researchers in the United States.  Additionally, a document is developed on the state of mathematics education in the United States and disseminated at the Congress.  Twelve of the travelers spend an additional eight days in Japan interacting with and learning from teachers and other educators in that country.\r\n",
