 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971903\r\n\r\nTwo research projects are being proposed.  Project (I) is concerned with analysis of high frequency time series data. Its objective is to develop a multivariate framework for analyzing effectively and efficiently high-frequency data observed in many scientific areas such as environmental study, finance and telecommunication.  It focuses on modeling time durations between observations and the associated quantities of interest by using a flexible dynamic model to govern the evolution of conditional distributions of variables involved.  The model also takes into account the effects of exogenous variables and cross dependence between the variables.  The proposed model builds on ideas of generalized linear models by relating conditional means and variances of the variables to the contemporaneous time duration and available information.  The model decomposes discrete-valued variables into ``direction'' and ``size'' of changes and uses a stochastic scale parameter evolving over time to describe the dynamic of time duration.  Consequently, the proposed model combines two sets of dynamic equations to form a multivariate dynamic system for high frequency time series data.  Properties of the proposed multivariate models are investigated, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are used in estimation.  Project (II) is concerned with detecting and modeling structural breaks in multivariate time series analysis.  It generalizes univariate results to the multivariate case in several directions such as to include processes with long-range dependence, to provide a joint detection for several types of structural breaks, and to investigate the relationships between detected breaks among components. \r\n\r\nAdvance in technology and data collection enables researchers to observe high-frequency data such as traffic patterns in internet, minute-by-minute measurements of ozone concentration and meteorological data via a satellite, and tick-by-tick transactions data in financial markets.  Key features of these data include extremely large sample sizes and in some cases irregularly spaced time intervals between events.  Analysis of such data is important for many reasons, including (a) it can provide an early warning signal, via predicting time interval to the next event and the associated measurements, of potential big surges in internet traffic or air pollution index in a metropolitan area, (b) it can shed light on the micro-structure of the system under study that is critical to understand the dynamic behavior of the data, and (c) it gives a framework on which scientists or data analysts can assess potential risk under different scenarios in a timely manner such as estimating the risk of a position held by a financial institution over a given time horizon. The goal of the proposal is (a) to provide an efficient and effective method for analyzing such  high-frequency data, (b) to bridge the gap between theory and applications of high-frequency data analysis, and (c) to develop methods for detecting structural breaks in a multivariate system that can occur in practice.  The proposal intends to use recent developments in statistical estimation, large-scale data processing, and multivariate time series analysis to achieve its goal.  Results obtained by the proposed research will have applications in many scientific areas beyond statistics such as in environment and global change, in telecommunication, in e-commerce, and in finance. Students will participate in the proposed research. \r\n",
