The researchers know that the subject Agrobacterium vitis chromosome contains several genes that are unique to the Hungarian species. Therefore, the A. vitis strains they collect will be characterized by molecular analysis, compared with others in a worldwide collection, and then measured for diversity by DNA fingerprinting and RAPD analysis.  Recovered nontumorigenic A. vitis strains from Hungary will be evaluated as biological controls of crown gall tumors in grapes and as a source of genes for the eventual construction of transgenic plants resistant to the devastating disease.   Results from this examination of the Agrobacterium-plant association should improve our understanding of: 1) plant tumorigenesis and its control by biological methods and 2) plant host-parasite interactions in general.  If successful, these findings may lead to practical applications in agriculture.\r\n\r\nThis project in plant biology fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.\r\n",
