Smoldering often occurs when oxidizer \r\nsupply to the reaction is limited, for example because it must flow \r\nthrough porous media to reach the reaction site.  Models of smoldering \r\ncombustion require a description of porous fluid flow as well as a \r\ndescription of the reaction process.  The resulting partial differential \r\nequations are highly nonlinear, making description of solutions difficult. \r\nNumerical simulations involving adaptive methods which change resolution \r\nas the process evolves have been able to approximate steady solutions to \r\nthese models in some detail.  Asymptotic methods have also been successful \r\nin describing steady and slowly varying approximate solutions to these \r\nmodels.  The proposed project involves extending both asymptotic and \r\nnumerical methods to the study of non-steady solutions and then using \r\nthese techniques to describe the details of the dynamics and transitions \r\nof these solutions.  This project should be of interest to scientists \r\nusing asymptotic methods, using adaptive numerical methods, studying \r\nsystems with multiple solutions, interested in issues of stability of \r\nsolutions with many time scales, or interested in the development of \r\nchaotic solutions.  It will be of particular interest to fire safety \r\nexperts who wish to understand dynamics of smoldering near extinction \r\nlimits, transitions from smoldering to flaming and patterns of smolder \r\npropagation through materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmoldering combustion is the burning of a solid without an airborne flame.  \r\nIt is of interest for fire safety not only as a precursor to flaming, but \r\nalso because it tends to release large quantities of toxic gases.  \r\nSmoldering is also used in the design of timing devices (ignition fuses), \r\nand material synthesis processes such as self-propagating high-temperature \r\nsynthesis.  Understanding the mechanisms and processes behind smoldering \r\ncan enhance fire safety as well as allow better control for engineering \r\nuses of smoldering combustion.  Models of smolder processes involve \r\nhighly nonlinear partial differential equations making description of \r\nsolutions difficult.  Approximate descriptions exist for steady uniform \r\npropagation and slowly varying propagation, but smoldering often involves \r\ncomplicated non-steady behavior.  Understanding the mechanisms which \r\ndrive this dynamical behavior should help us control smoldering systems\r\nand may even allow design of desirable smolder dynamics.  The proposed \r\nproject involves developing and extending high-performance computing\r\nalgorithms as well as analytical asymptotic methods to the study \r\nof non-steady smolder and then using these techniques to describe the \r\ndetails of the dynamics and transitions of these complex smolder waves.  \r\nThe solution methods introduced by this work and the specific \r\ndescriptions of the dynamics of smoldering will increase our \r\nunderstanding of the smoldering process and transitions to flaming.  \r\nIn addition, the techniques will likely be applicable in other areas of \r\ncombustion and problems of flow in porous media.  This project should be \r\nof interest to scientists using asymptotic methods, using adaptive \r\nnumerical methods for high-performance computing, studying systems with \r\nmultiple solutions, interested in issues of stability of solutions with \r\nmany time scales, or interested in the development of chaotic solutions.  \r\nIt will be of particular interest to fire safety experts and combustion \r\ncontrol engineers who wish to understand dynamics of smoldering near \r\nextinction limits, transitions from smoldering to flaming and patterns \r\nof smolder propagation through materials.\r\n",
