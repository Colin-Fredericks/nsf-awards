This microscope will be used to obtain quantitative information from living cells stained with fluorescent probes.  An instrument with the capabilities of the multi-mode microscope system is not currently available to the faculty and students at Dartmouth College.  This system is particularly suited for tracking proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in living cells.  The specific projects for which the microscope will be used include the study of the dynamics of the cytoskeleton.  In particular, interphase and spindle microtubules and actin filaments labeled by conjugating X-rhodamine to tubulin or actin as well as the dynamics of membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (GFP-tagged ER proteins) and the cell cortex (detected by differential interference contrast; DIC) in living cells will be studied.  Overlay of GFP and DIC images of cells will be performed to determine the interactions between the cytoskeleton and membranes of the ER.\r\n\r\nThis microscope will be available to the faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences and the Molecular and Cell Biology Graduate Program.  In addition to research, the instrument will be used to train undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, including participants in Dartmouth's Women in Science Program and the Ernest Everett Just program for African-American students in the Sciences.\r\n",
