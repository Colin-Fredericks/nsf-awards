 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban populations are exposed to a variety of environmental pollutants.  To develop strategies for minimizing exposure, it is necessary to understand the processes by which pollutants are transported from their sources to eventual sinks.  This project will improve our understanding of the key processes involved and will develop tools for assessing pollutant flows, focusing on the element lead in the Los Angeles Basin.  There are three general goals.  First, processes involving emissions of lead, as well as deposition and resuspension of lead-containing particles, will be identified.  This will be achieved by gathering existing information on airborne lead concentrations over several years and by conducting measurements of lead characteristic on achived filters.  Results of current research investigating deposition and resuspension of particles from surfaces will be applied.  Second, an improved mass balance model will be developed that can be used to identify key source categories and sinks of lead.  Possible control strategies for reducing airborne concentrations of lead will be identified.  This part of the project will make use of existing mass balance models, which will be modified and evaluated based on sensitivity analyses and use of engineering approximations.  Third, the project will include determination of the net benefits of each of several control strategies based on knowledge of lead sources and sinks, estimated reductions in human exposure, and costs of abatement.  Overall, the results of this project will help our understanding of factors influencing human exposure to environmental pollutants and will assist in developing control strategies to reduce exposure.",
