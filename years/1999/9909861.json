 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaboration between the University of New Hampshire and the University of Alaska.  It was submitted to the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program (EGB) and is supported by the Atmospheric Chemistry Program of the Division of Atmospheric Sciences; the Petrology and Geochemistry Program, and the Hydrologic Sciences Program of the Division of Earth Sciences; and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Chemistry of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.  \t\r\n\r\nMethyl bromide and methyl chloride are anthropogenically influenced trace gases that play an important role in the stratospheric ozone balance.  Although their biogeochemisty is not well understood, it is known that these gases have significant natural sources.  The atmospheric budgets of these gases are out of balance because the identified sinks for both gases outweigh known sources.  Recently, it has been discovered that flooded peatlands are a terrestrial source for these gases which could impact their global budget.  Information is still lacking about the regional distribution and magnitude of this new source and how the flooded soils might affect their ambient mixing ratios.  In this project direct flux measurements of methyl bromide and methyl chloride will be made in a variety of peatlands and experiments will be carried out to determine the chemical, physical, and biological parameters controlling these fluxes.",
