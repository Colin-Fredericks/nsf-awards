 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bona\r\n9974116\r\n     The overall technical objective of the project is to develop\r\nthree-dimensional topographical models that describe seabed\r\ndynamics in wave-dominated near-shore zones and shelf regions\r\nwhere single and multiple sand bars or sand ridges form a central\r\nmorphological feature.  The investigator models and analyses the\r\neffects of waves and currents on coastal dynamics.  This is\r\nchallenging because of the presence of two free surfaces, the\r\nwater surface and the movable bottom, both of which change over\r\ntime, and which interact with each other through complex,\r\nnonlinear processes.  The model features nonlinear, dispersive,\r\ndissipative partial differential equations to describe the\r\nevolution of waves coming in to the shore from deep water.  These\r\nequations, which are of Boussinesq type, are coupled to a model\r\nfor run-up and reflection at the shoreline.  Once the evolution of\r\nthe water surface is approximately known, the velocity field in\r\nthe bulk of the fluid may then be determined via potential\r\ntheory.  This velocity field is then viewed as driving a viscous,\r\nsediment-laden boundary layer in which the sediment transport is\r\ntaking place.  The velocity distribution in this layer is\r\ndetermined using ideas similar to those pioneered by\r\nLonguet-Higgins.  By applying conservation of sediment mass in an\r\ninfinitesimal form, a differential equation is thereby inferred\r\nthat serves to determine the bottom deformation.  Thus the entire\r\nmodel is somewhat complicated, consisting of a nonlinear\r\ninitial-boundary-value problem for the wave motion coupled in a\r\nnonlocal way to a conservation law for the bottom movement.  This\r\nmodel is developed in detail, analysed and implemented as a\r\ncomputer code.  Model predictions are compared with field data.\r\nIt is also proposed to link the computer code with input from a\r\nGeographical Information System, to allow easier deployment of\r\nthe model in real situations.\r\n     The underlying motivation for the project is two-fold.\r\nFirst, there is a desire to understand both qualitatively and\r\nquantitatively some of the fundamental processes that lead to the\r\nformation and maintenance of bottom structure in coastal zones\r\nand on continental shelves.  This involves a thorough knowledge\r\nof both the wave environment and the dynamics of the bed as it is\r\ninfluenced by waves and by currents.  Second, and not less\r\nimportant, the project responds to the need for new and more\r\nsophisticated tools to aid in the development of strategies to\r\ndeal with real coastal engineering problems.  The project has the\r\npotential to contribute to the study of a number of important\r\nscientific and environmental issues.  The ocean margins in North\r\nAmerica are vast and in many places, troubled.  Indeed, erosion\r\nof unconsolidated coastlines is a world-wide phenomenon that is\r\nnot well understood.  Global warming will aggravate these\r\nproblems by increasing sea levels, thus causing shore retreat and\r\nproviding a better base for the scour and erosion associated with\r\nwave activity.  Fragile Arctic coasts and low-altitude regions\r\nare already displaying unmistakable signs of deterioration caused\r\nby these global changes.  Severe erosion may well spread to other\r\ncoast regions within the next half century, and thus there will\r\nbe an increased interest in effective prevention methods.  In\r\naddition to \"hard\" protection schemes such as the construction of\r\nseawalls and the like, there will be an increased demand for\r\n\"soft\" protection strategies that take advantage of natural\r\nprocesses.\r\n",
