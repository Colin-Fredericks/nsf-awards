They plan a multi-scale inventory of a very diverse forest in Amazonian Ecuador, designed for comparison to existing inventory data  from a less diverse forest in Amazonian Peru. The two sites are roughly equivalent in soils, elevation, and rainfall, though the climate at the Peruvian site is more seasonal while the Ecuadorean site is significantly richer in  tree species.  The goal of this project is to generate enough information about diversity of  tropical forests to  determine why tropical forests close to the equator are more diverse than those elsewhere,  and whether individuals of a species are associated with a single forest type to a higher degree than would be expected under a random distribution. Data from  plots in which taxonomic identifications have been standardized will be used for the analyses.   \r\n \r\nThe project will provide estimates of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity for two of the richest plant communities ever studied.  It will provide new large-scale tests of ideas about how tropical tree communities function. It will also provide basic information about the abundance and distribution of hundreds of individual tree species  that will be of immediate use to the conservationists and managers charged with preserving these fast-disappearing ecosystems.  .  \r\n***\r\n",
