Gilkey\r\n\r\nGilkey will study time dependent processes which are controlled\r\nby the heat equation and the short time asymptotics which arise\r\nthereby. The first project involves the heat content asymptotics,\r\nmoving from the static setting to the setting where the data\r\n(metric, internal heat sources, boundary conditions) are time\r\ndependent. Previous work always assumed smooth boundary\r\nconditions; in this project the boundary conditions are\r\ndiscontinuous. The second project involves studying the\r\nasymptotics of the short time expansion of the fundamental\r\nsolution of the heat equation.  Most previous studies have\r\ninvolved static geometries, but it is natural to study these\r\nasymptotic expansions for time dependent geometries for quite\r\ngeneral operators of Laplace type and for quite general\r\nhomogeneous boundary conditions. This investigation will involve\r\nexpanding the usual calculus of pseudo differential operators to\r\nestablish the existence of the required short time asymptotics as\r\nwell as determining how the time dependent variation of the\r\nmetric and the coupling constants for Neumann boundary conditions\r\ninfluences the short time asymptotics of the heat kernel.\r\n\r\nThere are many physical settings where boundary conditions are\r\ndiscontinuous. For example, a body floating in ice water\r\nsatisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions on the part immersed in\r\nthe water and Neumann boundary conditions on the remainder\r\n(assuming as a first approximation that there is no heat transfer\r\nfrom the air to the body); the boundary conditions are\r\ndiscontinuous along the water/air interface. Understanding\r\nadditional boundary contributions coming from the water/air\r\ninterface are likely to be of great physical importance, and\r\nlinks the differential geometry of the situation to the physical\r\nunderpinnings of the subject. There are also many conditions\r\nwhere the geometry is not static; the Universe is expanding to\r\ncite one example. Boundary conditions in physical settings may\r\nvary with time; for example, the temperature outside a building\r\nvaries with the time of day as well as with the season;\r\nconsequently the associated heat flow is not well modeled by a\r\nstatic setting. Understanding the heat flow in this setting has\r\nobvious physical applications.  The heat equation asymptotics and\r\nheat content asymptotics have proven to be of central importance\r\nin theoretical physics.  For example, these asymptotics play an\r\nimportant role in the renormalization of field theory in curved\r\nspace and also in string and membrane theory, and they are\r\nrelated to zeta function renormalization.\r\n",
