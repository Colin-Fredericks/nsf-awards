 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project orients the practitioners within the Decision, Risk, and Management Science (DRMS)\r\nand the Innovation and Organizational Change (IOC) research communitites to the\r\nemerging developments critical to strategic management, organizational\r\ndesign, and decision making in today's\r\nturbulent organizational environment.  In its fifth year, the\r\nOrganization Science Winter Conference (OSWC -- a 50 person \"think tank\"\r\nstyle conference) has resulted in the identification of new research\r\nagendas through interdisciplinary approaches.  The conference has become\r\nknown for engaging leading theoretical ideas, as well as a way for\r\nresearch to be informed by practicing managers. \r\n\r\nThe 1999 OSWC topic is \"Negotiating the Shoals of Chaotic Environments.\"\r\nBoth the academic and popular press suggest that organizational\r\nstrategies and forms whose roots originate in the Industrial Age may no\r\nlonger be appropriate as we transition into a new era --\r\nPost-Industrial, Knowledge-based. The pace of the resulting competitive\r\nlandscape has clearly increased, but even more important has been the\r\nrise in volatility and environmental uncertainty.  Many believe that the\r\norganizational playing field has moved from a complex but predictable\r\nenvironment, to a field more aptly described as chaotic.  If this is the\r\ncase, then current knowledge in strategic and organizational theory is\r\nout of date.  The challenge facing the DRMS and IOC community and\r\npractitioners involves the development of new theories, models and\r\nmethodologies more appropriate for chaotic uncertainty.  \r\nAt this year's conference we anticipate explorations of the theme from a\r\nwide spectrum of perspectives--strategy, decision making, managerial\r\nand organization cognition, leadership, organization learning,\r\ncomplexity theory and chaos, information technology, knowledge and\r\nknowing, ecology, political economy, etc.  Specific topics likely to be\r\nincluded are quantifying and measuring chaotic environments, strategic\r\nresponses and organizational forms for turbulent situations, and\r\nmanagerial implications.\r\n\r\nThe grant provides funding for two new conference initiatives:\r\n(1) sponsorship for one leading scholar from Europe and one from Asia who\r\nwould otherwise not be able to attend, and (2) support related to the\r\ndevelopment and writing of a 'perspective' paper to be published in\r\nOrganization Science.",
