 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposed to build an experimental system that can provide scalable request-specific file service. The demands on the file and web servers continue to increase along with the increase in the diversity of application requirements (deterministic guarantees for continuous media retrieval, short latencies for interactive applications and throughput requirements of regular file retrieval).  The new applications' (multimedia and database decision support) requirements of large amounts of I/O bandwidth also prompt new directions in providing file service.  These application trends, coupled with the trends in the availability of hardware such as network-attached disks, and cheaper processing power, prompt us to investigate the following:  \r\n\r\n(a) How to provide flexible service in a file/storage system?\r\n(b) How to provide scheduling and resource allocation support for integrated service of multiple types of requests?\r\n(c) How to provide support for migrating service close to the data?\r\n(d) What kind of application interface should be provided for flexible service?\r\n\r\nThis project proposed to build and experimental prototype based on a cluster of PCs.  The prototype will be instrumental in evaluating the validity and efficacy of the proposed file-specific request service.\r\n",
