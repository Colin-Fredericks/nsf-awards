 "awd_abstract_narration": "This POWRE awardee's career goals as an economist in health services research are to develop and disseminate potential policy solutions for known problem areas in health care provision.  The objective for the award is for the investigator to gain a solid grounding in those ethical principles that are most related and relevant to the topics that she is currently and plans to continue studying, particularly the use of financial incentives in health care.  An internationally respected medical ethicist, Dr. Baruch Brody, will take a lead role in structuring and advising the investigator's study in ethics.  The planned activities include directed readings and extensive discussion of these readings. Readings in general biomedical and economics-related ethics will be followed by concentration on four issues related to the use of financial incentives: problems of binding commitments, coercion, exploitation and commodification.  In addition, relevant conferences in biomedical ethics will be attended.\r\n\r\nCurrently, significant resources are spent in health care research to document the shortcomings and inequities of the health care system. To have a positive effect however, health services research must to move beyond standard research, where many products are only of interest to academic journals, to research into health policies that are feasible for implementation and will be successful in improving health care provision. Thus, a crucial research step is to develop and analyze solutions to health care problems.  The development of feasible and acceptable policy proposals often requires incorporating ideas from a number of disciplines.  The POWRE funding will provide the means for the investigator to acquire a firm grounding in ethics.  This in turn will enable her to do research in the development and analysis of potential solutions to health care problems that are both economically efficient and ethically sound. Recommendation and implementation of such policies have potential for significantly improving provision and financing of health care.  The study period will culminate in a comprehensive ethics paper that undertakes a rigorous ethical analysis of the use of financial incentives in health care policies. This paper will serve as a reference for future work, both by the applicant and other researchers, on the ethics of financial incentives.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the POWRE program coincide perfectly with the aims and potential impact of this proposal.  Funding will provide a critical, timely movement toward the investigator's personal career goals. Personal career goals of policy development and implementation require that the applicant acquire a firm grounding in ethical literature and analysis, both to analyze the ethical implications of economic-based policies, and also to inform development of policies. In addition, success in promoting health care policies that are sound on a cross-disciplinary basis will create visibility in a multidisciplinary forum for the investigator in particular, and women in health policy making in general.\r\n",
