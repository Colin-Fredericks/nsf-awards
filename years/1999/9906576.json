 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to test hypotheses connecting the desire for retributive justice with the legitimacy of South African legal institutions. Based on a survey of the mass public, the PI will assess the implications of the truth and reconciliation process for mass perceptions of justice, for support for key legal and political institutions, for attitudes toward the rule of law, and ultimately for lawful behavior and willingness to acquiesce to outputs of policy-making institutions.  An important component of this project involves connecting \"Social Identity Theory\" (SIT) with theories of legitimacy and retributive justice. Recent research has posited that identity plays a crucial role in determining the consequences of perceived injustice. The racial/linguistic/ethnic diversity of South Africa provides a good context for testing these hypotheses.  It is unlikely that the lessons of the West readily translate into transitional and traditional societies like South Africa. This research will therefore provide a more general understanding of the ways in which injustice undermines the legitimacy of law. Ultimately, this research should provide insight into the ways in which perceptions of justice and injustice affect the consolidation of democratic transitions.\r\n\r\n",
