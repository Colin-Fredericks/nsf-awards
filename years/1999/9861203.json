 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861203\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes a novel method to synthesize nanoparticles of iron, cobalt and nickel for high performance magnetic recording media. Research on existing magnetic recording media, such as, gamma-ferric oxide, chromium dioxide and cobalt modified gamma-ferric oxide, is being directed towards accomplishing single domains, high magnetic saturation and high coercivities. Improper nucleation, growth and oxidation temperature control of colloidal particles, of such recording media, frequently results in chemically unstable particles. Concurrently, nanoparticles suggest many applications as storage devices due to presence of single domains, and transformations in the magnetic structure with induced magnetization on a nanometer scale. Multi-domains to single domain transformations and superparamagnetic behavior with reduction in particle size are also critical in influencing the magnetic characteristics of these nanoparticles. In this Phase I program, MMI proposes to synthesize nanoparticles of iron, cobalt and nickel to establish their potential as high performance materials for magnetic recording media. Coating of magnetic media will be pursued using a unique combination of binder, solvent, dispersant and plasticizer to ensure that the nanoparticles are uniformly distributed thus contributing to higher coercivity and magnetic saturation.\r\n     High-density information storage in the magnetic recording industry, increasing efficiency of magnetic refrigeration cycles (refrigeration industry), metallic pastes for circuits and as basic material for producing industrial catalysts, sintering aids and sensors.\r\n\r\n",
