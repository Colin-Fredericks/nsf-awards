 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tAlthough African Americans and Hispanics continue to be underrepresented in graduate school enrollments and even more severely among degree recipients, a growing number are attending the nation's highest quality doctoral degree programs in the sciences as well as in other disciplines. As with earlier stages in the education pipeline, access and representation of minority students are only part of the challenge facing graduate schools in the United States. In addition to being underrepresented, minority students in doctoral programs are also perceived to be lagging behind their majority counterparts on many indicators of success.\r\n\tThis research focuses upon measuring the relative success of underrepresented minority students who are enrolled in the nation's leading doctoral programs and identifying factors that may lead to even greater success. Success in this research is broad ranging and includes acquiring teaching and research skills, developing the skills and experience of scholarly inquiry, publishing both independently and in collaboration with professors, performing in course work, making steady progress toward receiving a degree, and being socialized to succeed in a chosen profession after completing their doctoral programs.\r\nThis research is centered upon a new database that has been developed from a representative sample of 14,020 doctoral students from 21 of the nation's most prestigious doctoral granting universities. The database is made up of a diverse sample of students who had completed at least one year of their doctoral programs, were enrolled in one of eleven science and non-science fields of study, and were registered for at least six credit hours in the fall of 1996. The Survey of Doctoral Student Finances, Experiences, and Achievements was used to collect the data for the study. A 70 percent response rate was achieved. The data will be analyzed using descriptive, comparative, and relational (regression) analyses to address the four questions. The research addresses the following questions:\r\n 1. What are the overall and relative quality of performance, experiences, and professional training and development achieved by underrepresented minority doctoral students?\r\n2. How do various types and amounts of indebtedness and financial assistance relate to the success of doctoral students of various racial/ethnic and social class backgrounds?\r\n3. How do such factors as academic and personal background characteristics and educational preparation relate to the quality of the support, experiences, achievements, and professional development of underrepresented minority doctoral students? And\r\n4. How do graduate institutions ensure the success of minority doctoral students in the sciences and other disciplines?\r\n",
