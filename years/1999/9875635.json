Parker, Ohio State University\r\nNSF proposal 9875635\r\nVibration and Stability of Spinning Disk-Spindle Systems and High-Speed\r\nBelt Drives\r\n\r\nThe research aspect of this CAREER proposal addresses vibration and stability problems in two mechanical systems in wide industrial use: spinning disk-spindle systems and high-speed serpentine belt drives.  Disk-spindle systems occur in many industrial applications including disk drives, geared transmissions, and turbomachinery. Serpentine belt drives are the automotive industry standard for powering vehicle accessories.  Similar devices are used in paper, tape drive, and textile processing systems. Both systems are subject to harmful dynamic response that causes noise, degrades performance, and limits operating life. These systems share two important properties: 1) they are gyroscopic systems and so their dynamic behaviors share many common features, and 2) they combine discrete elements with continuous, elastic bodies. Their hybrid discrete-continuous nature requires a novel analytical formulation to expose their classical gyroscopic structure and allow application of powerful analytical methods for dynamic analysis. A state-of-the-art experimental test stand is being designed in cooperation with an industrial sponsor to verify and guide the belt research. While the immediate research impact is to advance the dynamic modeling and understanding of these two systems, the work simultaneously aims to identify how the knowledge gained applies to general gyroscopic continua.\r\nThe educational initiatives involve: use of computer simulations and multimedia display during lectures, classroom demonstrations of physical systems,  field trips' to department research labs, and innovative use of the Web for lab instruction. The goal is a unique combination of practical demonstration of physical phenomena and traditional classroom presentation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
