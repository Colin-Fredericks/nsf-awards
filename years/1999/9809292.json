 "awd_abstract_narration": "Women are almost twice as likely as men to experience depressive symptoms, yet little is known about how this difference develops. Because the difference first occurs during adolescence, it has been assumed that it is due to changes that occur at that age. However, evidence suggests that the precursors are in place prior to adolescence. In this project, the possibility that parents may socialize these precursors is investigated. The major focus is on parents' use of control with daughters and sons. Parents are expected to push or guide their daughters more than they do their sons to meet externally set standards. Such differential treatment may cause girls to be more vulnerable than boys to challenge. Because adolescence is accompanied by a variety of challenges, such as the transition from elementary school to junior high school, parents' differential use of control may put girls at greater risk than boys for depressive symptoms at these ages. These hypotheses are examined by following elementary school children and their parents over the course of a year. Because exposure to challenge may be critical to the emergence of the sex difference in depression, half of the participating children encounter challenge in the form of a transition from one school to another, whereas the other half do not. Guided by multiple theoretical perspectives in psychology, the research will contribute to basic scientific knowledge in psychology, and offers strong potential for gaining new insight into a troubling and costly social problem.\r\n\r\n",
