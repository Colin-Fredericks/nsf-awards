 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  CAREER award supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, by Professor Vincent Remcho of Oregon State University is the development of molecular imprint polymer technology with microscale liquid phase separation techniques to be used as a new analytical tool in the screening of complex mixtures of biologically active molecules for specific activity.  Molecular recognition will be used in both covalent and noncovalent formats for the development of new stationary phase materials.  Tricyclic antidepressant compounds will be the target compounds for imprinting specificity.  The work will progress to novel specifc methods for the detection of PPAR mimics.  Bioanalytical course curricular reform forms the focus of the educational component of this CAREER proposal.\r\n\r\nThe premise of molecular imprinting is that a memory of a molecule's shape and size can be created in a three dimensional structure.  Once that memory is established, it becomes a selective tool, much as a key fits into a lock.  In the case of Professor Remcho's work, the selectivity gained through molecular imprinting is used to advantage in separations of targeted compounds from a complex mixture.\r\n",
