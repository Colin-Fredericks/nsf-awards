Major applications for composite structures include liner and cap systems, foundation systems, underground utility installations, and communications.  Design methodologies for these applications require knowledge of the steady-state friction between soil and structure.  At present no good microscopic model exists for this interaction.\r\n\r\nIn this study the steady-state friction forces between the soil and the surface material of typical civil infrastructure components will be modeled as an abrasion process.  An existing tribology model for predicting friction and wear in abrasion will be extended to include geomaterials.  The model will be validated with experimental results.  First the geometric and spatial properties of soil grains over a range of shapes will be quantified.  Then the forces exerted by these particles on unlubricated and lubricated surfaces under conditions of variable normal stress and variable material hardness will be measured and the results compared with the predictions of the model. \r\n***\r\n",
