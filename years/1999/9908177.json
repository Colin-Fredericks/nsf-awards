The Feedback Group represents a collection of several high-technology companies that together address international markets in the design and manufacture of electrical, electronic, and microprocessor based equipment for industry and education.  A major objective of this research partnership includes the analysis, design, development, and implementation of innovative control strategies, such as model reference adaptive and neural network control, for optimal load sharing, internal force control, and efficient coordination of two cooperating manipulators.  Analytical effort during this research includes a comprehensive closed-chain kinematic and dynamic modeling, stability and convergence investigation of neural networks, and adaptive control scheme formulation.  Experimental work involves the implementation of control configurations via high-speed digital signal processors on two IBM 7540 robots available in the Robotics and Manufacturing Automation Laboratory at Duke University and cooperating robots in the flexible manufacturing work cells marketed by Feedback, Inc. In addition, there is significant students' industry-university interaction via mutual technical visits, summer internships at Feedback, and collaborative research experiments.  The major outcome and impact of this research effort include human resource development; the design and implementation of innovative control concepts applicable to cooperating robots functioning in industrial as well as in educational flexible manufacturing systems; and the development of courseware modules related to the project. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
