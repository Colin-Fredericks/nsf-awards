 "awd_abstract_narration": "Database triggers are rules that monitor a database for interesting changes to the data. These rules can take action based on these changes. For example, the action can be to notify a person by email or pager, update the database, or run a program. This project is developing new techniques for processing database triggers that are fast and can support many times more triggers than can be handled now. Current database trigger processing systems are synchronous. In other words, triggers run inside the same transactions that are updating the data. This project is developing scalable trigger processing capability in a number of ways, including: (1) testing trigger conditions and running trigger actions after database update transactions complete; (2) developing special algorithms and data structures for fast trigger condition checking; (3) applying parallel processing on shared-memory multiprocessor computers to test trigger conditions and run trigger actions more quickly; and (4) developing a timer-driven trigger capability that checks trigger conditions periodically rather than after each update. This project's vehicle for developing, demonstrating, testing and refining new, scalable trigger processing architectures and algorithms is the TriggerMan prototype. TriggerMan is being implemented as an extension module to a commercial, object-relational database management system, a driver program, and an application programming interface library. The high-performance, scalable trigger processing capability being developed by this research will give people more timely notification of important new information in databases. This is more important than ever given the pervasiveness of corporate databases and networks, and the Internet. \r\nhttp://www.cise.ufl.edu/~hanson/TriggerMan/\r\n\r\n",
