 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recent NSF-sponsored workshop regarding Curricular Developments in the Analytical Sciences (DUE-9615091) recognized a need to implement experiments which prepare students for independent problem-solving in a laboratory setting.  Such experiments provide students with opportunities  to solve problems through the cognitive skills of critical thinking and the use of modern laboratory techniques.  The effort at Kutztown University to implement these types of experiments involves the use of a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and the appropriate accessories.  The GC/MS is used in five laboratory courses (Organic Chemistry I and II, Environmental Analysis, Instrumental Analysis, and Biochemistry) for a total of eleven experiments.  Of these experiments, four are from the chemical education literature, of which two were developed with NSF support (Bishop: CHE-8952157, Rubinson:  DUE-9352407).  In one of the other experiments, a technique used extensively in commercial environmental analysis (purge and trap sample concentration) is adapted to the undergraduate laboratory curriculum.  Each experiment is problem driven in that its explicit purpose is to answer a question or explore an idea.  Students learn how to address chemical questions via laboratory methods by a graduated curriculum which requires from the student increasing amounts of experimental design.  In upper level courses experiments follow a problem-based learning model in which a group of students are given a problem and required to research the problem, develop a procedure, carry out the experiment, and analyze the results.  This training better prepares students to take an active role in experimental design in their occupation or further education.",
