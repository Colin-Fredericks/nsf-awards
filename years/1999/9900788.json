 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although considerable attention has been devoted to environmental degradation in many parts of the world, scholarly examinations have shown that human modification of the natural environment occurs through a diverse array of processes, each of which must be considered within social, cultural, economic, political, and legal contexts of the locales where environmental change occurs.  This is particularly true in the highlands of northwestern Nepal, where a range of land-management practices that have significantly altered vegetation patterns have evolved.  This doctoral dissertation research project will conduct case studies in two villages east of Lake Rara National Park in the Mugu District, linking analyses of social relations of power, including analyses of class, caste, and gender relations, with analyses of cultural practices and ecological conditions associated with different land-management practices.  A range of research approaches will be used, including interviews and focus groups, community map-making and transect walking, oral histories, analysis of government documents, aerial photo interpretation, and vegetation sampling.  Information gathered from these sources will be used to examine how social and power relations, cultural practices, and ecological conditions interact to influence land-management practices and resource use.  Attention also will be given to conflicts and consensus among different individuals and groups regarding the meanings of land and various land-use practices.  The dissertation, publications, and presentations resulting from this research project will contribute to understandings of the complex ways through which various aspects of human activity interact with each other and with natural phenomena to alter environmental conditions.  Because of its well-developed theoretical framework, these case studies will contribute to development, political ecology, and feminist literatures as well as to understandings of the human dimensions of global change.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
