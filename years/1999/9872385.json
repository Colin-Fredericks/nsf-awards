 "awd_abstract_narration": "Locialized corrosion of materials often leads to the failure of industrial, civil, and military infrastructure well before the designed lifetime.  the rate that a small corrosion pit penetrates a material is dictated by the chemistry of the materia and its interactions with the environment via convective, diffusive, and ohmic transport processes.  The proposed research addresses the issue of predicting corrosion put growth rates by combining fundamental studies of corrosion chemistry, transport and reaction modeling, and sensor development.  Nickel, copper, and aluminum will be used as test beds for the proposed approach.  The corrosion of these materials will occur in an acoustic streaming flow, which serves as a realistic surrogate  for the flow found in microscopic corrosion pits.  Line imaging Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical methods will be used to identify and quantify reactive species that form at the corroding surface and within the electrolyte near the surface.  Modeling will combine the chemical kinetic information obtained in the corrosion chemistry studies with convective/diffusive transport theory to predict corrosion rates in the various materials.  Finally, the characteristics of acoustic streaming flows and cyclic voltammetry will be used to develop a technique for rapidly assessing the propensity of any material to aggressively pitting in the presence of agitation.",
