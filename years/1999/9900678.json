 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed research are to: 1.improve the fundamental understanding of linkages between monetary economic values, indicators and indexes of natural resource values, and benefit transfer methodologies; 2. develop indicators of wetlands values that reflect the ecological and social context of resource asset; 3. develop GIS-based methodologies for economic valuation that are akin to, and complement, watershed approaches used in natural science studies.; 4. coordinate with officials in the State of Rhode Island to develop practical methods for ranking wetland restoration projects using indicators of social, ecological, and economic values; and 5. develop standardized methodologies allowing transfer of models and results to other sites.\r\n\r\nPhase I will develop the theoretical model and operational methodology of the study, and provide initial steps in defining indicators. This phase will include development of conceptual linkages between indicators, indexes and economic valuation methods; coordination of the approach with data collection efforts by Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management; identification of an initial set of indicators to serve as a starting point for the field research; and development of models to allow linking of indicators with benefits transfer methods. Phase II will identify key indicators of values as expressed by technical \"experts\" and by the general public. These data will be used to refine and quantify the indicators, to quantify linkages between economic values and indicators, to compare \"expert\" and public values, and to develop methods that use expert assessments as input into public value elicitation tools. Phase III will use methods and data developed in Phases I and II to develop and implement the GIS-based tool for identifying wetland priorities. Phase III will also compare different approaches (dollar valuation, utility indexes and value indicators), apply results to the Narragansett Bay watershed in Rhode Island, and test the transferability of the method to other sites.\r\n\r\nThe research will develop and implement a GIS-based tool for prioritizing wetlands restoration and rehabilitation projects, and will combine indicators of social and economic values with science-based methods being implemented by the state, to develop coordinated methods to balance multiple objectives in a systems context. The research will provide close linkages between previously disconnected methods for identifying and measuring economic values associated with natural systems, creating an interdisciplinary tool for prioritizing restoration projects. The approach will be designed to estimate and compare economic valuation, (utility-based) economic indexes, and indicators of economic value.\r\n",
