Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nPhotosynthetic oxygen evolution is the process by which light energy is\r\nused to convert water to molecular oxygen.  Photosystem II is the\r\nmultisubunit enzyme directly responsible for this oxidation in plants, green\r\nalgae and cyanobacteria.  The core of the oxygen-evolving complex is a\r\ncluster of four manganese atoms, which accumulate the four oxidizing\r\nequivalents necessary for the oxidation of water.  Current efforts are\r\nunderway to understand the nature of ligation to the manganese cluster, the\r\nstructures of the Mn cluster in the various oxidation states and the exact\r\nmechanism of water oxidation.  Three extrinsic proteins, having molecular\r\nweights of 18,24, and 33 kilodaltons are directly involved in enzymatic\r\nactivity and stability.  The largest of these is also called the manganese\r\nstabilizing protein (MSP) and plays an important role in stabilizing the\r\nactive site.  However, the exact nature of its role is unknown.  One\r\ncurrently held theory is that MSP may sequentially deprotonate and protonate\r\nduring photosynthetic water oxidation.  Such deprotonation reactions could\r\nplay a role in the stabilization of charge separated transition states in\r\nthe manganese cluster, thus lowering the activation energy for water\r\noxidation.  In order to shed further light on the role of this protein in\r\noxygen evolution, an isotopically edited version of MSP will be prepared.\r\nLight minus dark difference infrared spectroscopy of photosystem II\r\ncomplexes containing either isotope-edited or native MSP will be used to\r\nprobe for the changes that occur in this specific protein as the light\r\ninduced reactions take place.  Finally, solid state nuclear magnetic\r\nresonance spectroscopy of these labeled complexes will be used to shed\r\nfurther light on the changes that occur in the manganese stabilizing protein\r\nas photooxidation occurs. Under the POWRE program, the PI will spend a\r\nsabbatial leave to undertake this study in the laboratory of Bridgette Barry \r\nat the Unversity of Minnesota.  The experience so gained will be integrated \r\ninto both research  and teaching by the PI at the Colorado College.\r\n\r\n2. Non-technical abstract \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n     Photosynthesis is the means by which a plant converts solar energy into\r\nchemical energy.  Although the process has been studied extensively, the\r\nmolecular details are still far from being completely understood.\r\nDetermination of the mechanism of photosynthesis is very important due to\r\nour global dependence on solar energy for both energy and food.  It is also\r\nthe ultimate hope that a better understanding of the natural system will\r\ninspire the construction of devices that can mimic the biologicial system\r\nand efficiently use solar energy for human use.  The plant uses light to\r\nconvert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen in two distinct\r\nphases.  The first phase is often referred to as the \"light reactions.\"  In\r\nthese reactions, the plant converts light energy into chemical energy stored\r\nin the plant, and water into oxygen.  In the second phase, the chemical\r\nenergy stored in the plant is used to convert carbon dioxide to glucose annd\r\nother carbohydrates.  These reactions can occur in the absence of light and\r\nare referred to as the dark reactions.  A large protein complex called\r\nPhotosystem II is primarily reponsible for the \"light reactions\" in plants.\r\nIt contains chlorophyll, a cluster of four manganese atoms, and a number of\r\nlarge proteins and other important molecules.  The purpose of my work will\r\nbe to gain more insight into the environment and structure of the manganese\r\ncluster and the surrounding proteins as it undergoes these \"light\r\nreactions\", and to integrate the knowledge so obtained into the teaching activities \r\nof the PI.\r\n",
