 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most contentious areas of environmental social science research over the last 10 years has been \"environmental justice,\" a movement promoting the fair treatment of people of all races, incomes and cultures with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws and policies.  Various studies have been done in the last several years on whether the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") discriminates against minorities in its civil judicial enforcement cases by imposing lower penalties on violators in disproportionately minority areas.  These studies used data from EPA's DOCKET database, which contains records of EPA's civil enforcement cases since 1972.\r\n\r\nSubsequent studies by this project's principal investigator focused substantial attention on the quality of the DOCKET data.  DOCKET data were found to have errors or omissions in the penalty amounts, descriptions and locations of the violations, and relevant dates.  Obviously, if the data are inaccurate or incomplete, they cannot be used reliably in analyses.  The purpose of this project is to verify and augment DOCKET data so that future research, whether environmental justice-related or otherwise, can use the data with greater flexibility and more assurance of their validity.  The information in each of approximately 2,400 DOCKET cases will be checked against the available source documents (e.g., consent decrees or judicial opinions) to correct and augment DOCKET.  Furthermore, databases from EPA and elsewhere will be used to identify the latitude and longitude coordinates of the violation locations so that future studies can use their precise locations.  The final result of this process will be an improved DOCKET database that can be used for more reliable and sophisticated statistical analyses of EPA's enforcement processes.\r\n",
