 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water vapor is one of the most important trace gases in the atmosphere.  Not only is it central to the formation of clouds and precipitation, but it affects the transfer of both solar and terrestrial radiation and is a \"greenhouse\" gas in the same sense as carbon dioxide.  Unlike CO2, water vapor is highly variable in time and space; a continuing challenge has been to devise an accurate and reliable way of measuring the vertical profile of water vapor by some form of remote sensing.  To date the only methods that can do this with acceptable vertical resolution are based on lidar techniques, either Raman lidar or differential absorption lidar (DIAL).  The DIAL technique depends on the variation of the absorption coefficient of water vapor with wavelength.  Narrow-band coherent light is transmitted through the atmosphere at two wavelengths that are close together, but chosen so that one is at an absorption maximum and the other at a minimum.  The light is backscattered by atmospheric molecules and aerosols and collected at the lidar receiver.  The difference in signal intensity from a given range at the two wavelengths depends on the two-way integrated attenuation to the range and may be used to infer the concentration of water vapor as a function of position along the path.  DIAL systems tend to be large, heavy, and expensive because the delicate optical equipment they employ requires close climate control and shielding from vibration.  The purpose of this project is to develop a novel DIAL system based on recent advances in fiber-optics technology.  The transmitter is the unique aspect of the system.  It consists of  a laser diode master oscillator and a fiber power amplifier.  The result is a cheaper, lighter, and simpler lidar that produces a transmitted wave with greater spectral purity than a conventional lidar based on bulk optics.  The concept has been proven with a prototype model operating in the 940 nm water vapor band.  The goal of this project is to develop a fieldable version of the prototype by scaling the transmitted power upwards by about 30 dB and to evaluate the instrument by comparison with other remote sensing and in situ observations.",
