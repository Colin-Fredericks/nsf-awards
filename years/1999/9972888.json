 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores the synthesis of a wide variety of organofluorine compounds.  The principal means by which this is achieved involves the use of molecular fluorine, for which new procedures have been devised that will permit the study of its reaction with a wide variety of substrates.  In addition, much larger quantities of these new materials will be accessible.  Many of the new substances prepared during the previous periods of support have been shown to possess useful properties that are appropriate for a number of applications.  Further study will extend the scope of these reactions and because of the expansion in the number of substrate types, new chemistry may well be discovered.  \r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Richard J. Lagow of the University of Texas at Austin.  Professor Lagow's research targets new methods and reactions that incorporate fluorine atoms into the structure of organic molecules, typically by replacement of hydrogen atoms.  Part of the anticipated progress in this project centers on the use of a novel reactor for the convenient and safe use of molecular fluorine under controlled conditions.  In this way, the variety of molecules that can be exposed to fluorination will be expanded significantly.  The properties of these new organofluorine compounds will be evaluated for potential applications, of which there are many.  For instance, organofluorine compounds are being studied as blood substitutes and as lubricants for sensitive microelectronic devices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
