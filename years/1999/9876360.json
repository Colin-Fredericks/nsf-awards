 "awd_abstract_narration": "9876360\r\nTeraoka\r\nThis award will investigate thermodynamics and partitioning of nondilute polymer solutions in confining geometries such as those provided by porous materials, and, at the same time, invigorate educational programs at the PIs' institutions through collaborative training.  The confined polymer solution systems to be studied are:  (1) a nondilute solution of monodisperse polymer; (2) a nondilute solution of a mixture of two polymers different in length; (3) a nondilute ternary solution consisting of two homopolymers and a common solvent.  Computer simulation will be used to study the nature of reduced dimensionality of the confined solutions in the first system, to calculate the chemical potential and the partition coefficient in the second system, and to map the phase diagram and calculate the correlation length in the third system.  Partitioning experiments will be conducted to elucidate the partitioning behavior in the second and third systems.  Static and dynamic light scattering will be used to determine the phase diagram and the correlation length in the third system.  Experimental results will be compared with the simulation results.  The two PIs will set up a joint training program in which participating students will be exchanged during the summer to maximize students' exposure and participation in advanced education and research that one institution alone cannot offer.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award will enhance undergraduate and graduate education at North Carolina A&T State University, a Historically Black Institution, and Polytechnic University through bi-directional training of the students at the two institutions.  The research project, thermodynamics and partitioning of nondilute polymer solutions in confining geometries, will be used to equip the students, especially Minority students, with knowledge and skills necessary for their future scientific carriers.  Results of the research will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms in large-scale chromatographic separation of polymers.\r\n***  \r\n  \r\n",
