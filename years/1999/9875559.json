 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this project will address theoretical and practical issues in the development and implementation of continuous optimization algorithms and their application to problems in mathematical finance and chemical process engineering. Algorithm design efforts will focus on interior-point methods, including the study of semidefinite\r\nprogramming, complementarity, general nonlinear programming, and robust optimization problems. Particular attention will be devoted to the development and analysis of potential-reduction methods and  algorithms that reliably detect infeasible problems, as well as to the efficient implementation of these methods. Implementation efforts will include the continuation of the improvement of SDPT3, a research code for semidefinite\r\nprogramming. Robust optimization problems will be studied through saddle-point formulations and polynomial-time interior-point algorithms for this class of problems will be developed. \r\n\r\nThe applications in mathematical finance will focus on the study of pricing of financial derivative securities in the presence of transaction costs through optimization models, and on the development of methods to find robust and low turn-over solutions to portfolio selection problems.  This project will also continue the investigator's current collaboration with chemical engineers on the study of optimization models and\r\nmethods to solve chemical process engineering problems. \r\n\r\nThe integrated educational activities of this project include (1) further development of graduate courses in optimization, portfolio theory, and interior-point methods already introduced by the investigator; (2) participation in outreach activities through project direction at CMU's Summer Undergraduate Institute; (3) facilitation of active involvement of \r\nundergraduate students in local industries through the introduction and running of a new project course; (4) a long-term plan for the preparation of a graduate-level textbook on portfolio optimization.  \r\n\r\nThe theoretical insights gained from this research will lead to\r\ndesign of more efficient optimization algorithms.  The models, methods, and software resulting from this project has the potential to produce improved decisions and performance on several application areas in science and technology. \r\n\r\n",
