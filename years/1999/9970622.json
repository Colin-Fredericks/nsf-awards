 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator works in three areas of Combinatorics:  Probabilistic Methods, Extremal Combinatorics, and Ramsey Theory.  Using the methodology of the probabilistic method, as started  by Paul Erdos, the existence of a combinatorial object is shown  by exhibiting a suitable probabilistic space in which the desired  object has a positive probability. One of the goals is to find  efficient methods for studying probabilistic spaces arising from  combinatorial problems. The first part of this project concentrates  on two lines of research: on a detailed description  of the threshold phenomena mainly in the framework of the first order  logics and on research in the area of 0-1 laws for logics with richer  signatures. Due to the methods used this area lies on the border between  probabilistic methods and finite model theory. The investigator's   focus in extremal combinatorics and ramsey theory is  on studying set systems with forbidden configurations. This is, very  often, closely connected with the research in probabilistic methods.  An example of problems in this area, which connect extremal combinatorics,  ramsey theory, as well as information theory, are problems on delta-systems  and on Shannon capacities of graphs. \r\n\r\nThe investigator works in the area of Combinatorics. One part  of this project concentrates on studying random combinatorial  structures. This is motivated by problems coming from the area of random algorithms as well as from the area studying random  models in statistical mechanics. As an example, the investigator  studies emergence of certain properties in random structures,  so called threshold phenomena. The research involves developing  efficient methods for studying probabilistic spaces arising in  these problems as well as studying logics which describe the properties  of interest. The investigator's focus in extremal combinatorics and  ramsey theory is on studying set systems with forbidden configurations.  Equivalently, the problems studied by the investigator deal with  appearance of certain patterns in set systems. An example of problems  in this area are problems on delta-systems and  on Shannon capacities  of graphs. These problems are connected to problems in information  theory and transmission of information. \r\n",
