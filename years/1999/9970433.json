 "awd_abstract_narration": "DISCRETE PROBLEMS\r\nJEFF KAHN\r\n\r\nThe investigator is interested in a diverse set of problems in discrete mathematics and related areas.  Topics considered include: (1) Partially ordered sets. (This includes new approaches to several classical questions about sorting under partial information.  One main theme focuses on the behavior of various new parameters, with the intention of gaining a global understanding of the mysterious space of linear extensions of a poset.)  (2) Random matrices.  (Central here are questions about the first dependency among vectors drawn uniformly and independently from the set of vectors of a fixed weight in a high-dimensional vector space over a fixed finite field.  Recent work of J. Komlos and the investigator settled several issues concerning sparse random matrices over finite fields, and it is expected that the ideas developed in that work will be relevant to the present questions.)  (3) Randomized complexity of graph properties.  (The basic problem here is an old conjecture of R.M. Karp concerning the power of randomization in decision tree algorithms.  The investigator suggests an approach to this which, inter alia, leads to a range of new questions in the classical area of random graphs.)  (4) Entropy and the hard-core model. (One main issue here is estimation of the critical activity for the hard-core lattice gas model on the d-dimensional integer lattice.  It is hoped that this, as well as several other problems, can be attacked using an entropy method developed in earlier work of the proposer and his student A. Lawrenz.) (5) A percolation problem of Kasteleyn.  (Recent work of J. van den Berg and the proposer gives hope of a proof of Kasteleyn's simple but powerful correlation conjecture.)  (6) Conjectures of Chvatal and Frankl.  (The investigator suggests novel approaches to these two notorious old \"extremal\" problems from the theory of finite sets.)\r\n\r\nMany of the question addressed here are of interest for computer science or statistical physics.  In particular, (1) and (3) are concerned with fundamental questions about the intrinsic complexity of (that is, theoretical limits on the efficiency of procedures for) basic algorithmic problems such as sorting and searching; while those in (4) and (5) deal especially with, roughly speaking, the spread of information in physical systems.  All are also of interest on purely mathematical grounds: each is centered on one or more problems against which current methods have proved woefully inadequate, so that significant progress requires significant new ideas.  New approaches are proposed for most of the problems considered.  One common theme is the application ideas from other areas of mathematics (e.g. entropy, geometry, Fourier analysis) to discrete problems.  Conversely, there is the possibility, particularly in (4) and (5), of bringing discrete ideas to bear on problems which until now have mainly been studied by people in other disciplines.\r\n",
