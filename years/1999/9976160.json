 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inter-group violence has often been seen as an inevitable characteristic of the postcolonial predicament, a view ignores the crucial historical role played by colonial powers in establishing criminal justice systems and law enforcement agencies for colonized peoples. This research analyzes the intersection of criminal justice, violence and dispute resolution on the Ionian Islands during the period in which they were part of the British Empire. Analysis of archival records is undertaken to clarify how colonial officials responded to violence.  It is hypothesized that indigenous codes of conduct, including socially-sanctioned violence, shaped the actual application of the law in ways that transformed both the role of the law and the role of government in local affairs. The study will contribute to a better understanding of violence and dispute resolution in colonial contexts through historically-informed analysis.",
