 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875770\r\nKuhn\r\nThe research proposed in this career plan addresses key issues in development of RF integrated circuits (RFICs) operating at L-Band through C-Band frequencies. In particular, the problems associated with creating completely integrated RF circuits and systems will be studied. These problems include the need for on-chip bandpass filtering to enable the realization of classic heterodyning transceiver architectures, and to improve dynamic range performance of newer, direct conversion (zero-IF) and image-reject mixer-based designs [3]. Such filters can be created through the application of on-chip inductors and Q-enhancement techniques. Practical problems in realizing this technology will be addressed and related technologies will be developed, including the design of bandpass Sigma-Delta analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and creation of techniques for successfully integrating RF circuitry with baseband digital circuitry on a single die.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will be carried out with the assistance of students in a new undergraduate RF integrated circuits course that closely approximates the project team environment found in industry today. Student teams will work together to design, build, and test core components of integrated RF transceivers in CMOS/BiCMOS Silicon technologies operating at 900, 1800, and 2400 MHz in years 1 and 2, with extension to complete integration and higher frequencies (6 (}Hz) in years 3 and 4. With oversight and direction provided by the PI and a core team of graduate students supported by the project, this class will allow undergraduate and graduate students alike to understand and evaluate recent advances in the field, to contribute to current research, and to build the team-oriented design skills they will need to remain competitive throughout their careers. Publication of research results and educational techniques developed will extend the reach of the project beyond Kansas State University, assisting other researchers in the field and other schools with interests in developing similar educational programs.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the proposed technology will enable future wireless system designers to create true single-chip and embedded radio hardware solutions with performance exceeding that of integrated direct-conversion and image-reject designs currently being developed, and approaching that of superhet products based on larger and more expensive discrete devices. Attendant reductions in both size and cost of wireless link components will extend the reach of wireless technology into important new applications in the next decade.\r\n",
