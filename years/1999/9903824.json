The objective is to develop and transfer to industry the techniques that can translate the detailed real-time data to the simple power flow data required by the electricity traders. The methods will allow for viewing in near real-time the data necessary to determine if trades fall within operational limits. WSU will formulate a data model that is sufficiently robust to allow mapping from the Common Infromation Model (CIM) to the load flow model, and will develop appropriate state estimation approaches based on the state-of-the-art methods for bad measurement detection, topology determination and parameter estimation.  In addition, WSU will design and implement database software that can project the real time data (output of the state estimator) from the CIM onto a standard load flow data model, such as, PTI.  Incremental Systems will provide industrial expertise, advise and critique on the methodology as well as provide support on the design and application of the the methods.  While WSU will write the software, Incremental Systems' knowledge of the database software will be integral to the software implementation and most of their effort in hours is expected to fall under this task.  Furthermore, Incremental systems will test software through simulation using the the Operator Training Simulator for a practical system with an emphasis on exercising data failures, bus splits, equipment outages and other data difficulties. WSU will run the cases studies, evaluate the performance based on criteria from Incremental Systems and make any necessary changes to the software.\r\n",
