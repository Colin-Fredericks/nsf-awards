 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns mathematical problems in the theory \r\nof  self-consistent charged-particle transport  systems at different scales.\r\nOf particular interest is to address the mathematical issues in kinetic\r\ntransport under strong forcing (a high built-in electric field due to  \r\ninhomogeneities of the flow region), and the hierarchy of anisotropic \r\nhydrodynamic models derived under these conditions. These models arise \r\nnaturally when non-equilibrium current flow in heterogeneous structures \r\nsuch as semiconductor devices is studied. Similar models are used to describe \r\nbiological transport in ionic channels, due to significant electrical activity through \r\ncellular membranes.  One of the new aspects of the planned research is the \r\nmathematical and computational understanding of transition layers  \r\nthat involve the linking of scales through kinetic and macroscopic levels for \r\ntransport models, both under low and high electric field effects. In both \r\ncases, analytical studies are to be complemented by numerical simulation\r\nof solutions of the corresponding model equations.\r\n  \r\nThis research addresses mathematical models that are used to describe\r\nelectron and ion transport in semiconductors and in biological membranes.\r\nOne of the main challenges comes from the fact that in these phenomena, processes \r\nthat occur at very different length and time scale are coupled and influence \r\neach other.  The mathematical work will lead to faster computational methods \r\nfor the simulation of such phenomena which are at the same time more accurate. \r\nTechnological areas which are as different as microelectronics and pharmacology \r\nwill ultimately benefit from this work.\r\n\r\n",
