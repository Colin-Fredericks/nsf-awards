Specifically, the project will study automorphic L-functions through the systematic examination of certain Dirichlet series in two complex variables built up out of sums of L-functions.  These naturally occurring Dirichlet series are not themselves Euler products, but their individual coefficients are Eulerian.  The intent is to use the extra variable in these series to extract analytic information similar to that which one could be obtained by the approximate functional equation were it possible to carry it out to infinite length.  These two variable Dirichlet series originally appeared in investigations of Rankin-Selberg integrals.  This project will also continue the study these integrals.\r\n\r\nIn the last part of the twentieth century, the arithmetic properties of the integers have found new application in communications, security and other surprising areas of modern life.  Mathematicians have long studied the integers in a branch of mathematics called number theory.  Some of the simplest properties of the integers still contain deep mysteries, and recently mathematicians have developed powerful new techniques to explore these mysteries.  The broad aim of this project is to study functions which exhibit certain complicated symmetries.  These functions are of interest because they often encode arithmetic information about other things, for instance the number of solutions  to sets of equations.  The study of these functions provides insight into the symmetries and into the encoded arithmetic. \r\n",
