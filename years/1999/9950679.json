 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project presents an innovative, seamless approach to improving the teaching and learning of mathematics for elementary teachers. It aims to enhance the quality of elementary education mathematics by implementing materials that improve pre-service and developmental mathematics training in the content and reconceptualization of mathematics. A four-course sequence of developmental and mathematics education courses, taught by cross-institutional faculty teams from Eastern Michigan University, Henry Ford Community College, and Schoolcraft College, are implementing the Uri Treisman workshop model, through utilizing NSF K-12 materials--Investigations in Number, Data, and Space, Connected Mathematics Project and Core Plus Mathematics. A major theme uniting the curriculum is reconceptualization versus review and remediation addressing the needs of prospective elementary teachers who are underprepared in mathematics.\r\n\r\nChanges in students' content knowledge, problem-solving ability, and attitudes toward mathematics are being measured by both formative and summative evaluations. Participating faculty are disseminating results to the mathematics education and developmental mathematics communities through articles and presentations; distributing project/ seminar materials for the courses; and exchanging ideas and data via a World Wide Web site linked through the University's home page and EMU's Web Caucus. EMU's national prominence in preparing educators gives the project's success extensive visibility and impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
