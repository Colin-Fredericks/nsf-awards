 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigators will upgrade Rayleigh scatter and resonance lidars at the Atmospheric Lidar Observatory (ALO) at the Center for Atmospheric and Space Sciences (CASS) at Utah State University.  The upgrade includes detectors and a data acquisition system so that scientific observations can be made with the two lidar systems from the stratosphere into the lower thermosphere.  Currently, there is one detector and a one-channel data acquisition system.  The funds will be used to purchase new detectors for both lidars, a data acquisition system, and software for controlling the data acquisition and telescope pointing.  This combination of hardware and software will enable ALO to contribute middle atmosphere temperature and wind observations in support of CEDAR/TIMED science goals.  CEDAR, which stands for Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions, is a global change program that combines theoretical modeling with ground-based measurements to study the upper atmosphere and ionosphere.  TIMED, for Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, is a NASA satellite program to study similar regions of the atmosphere.  The joint CEDAR/TIMED program aims to coordinate ground-based and space-based observations to achieve better understanding of physical processes in the lower thermosphere and ionosphere.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
