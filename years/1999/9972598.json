 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972598\r\n\r\nThe research deals with several closely related areas of Bayesian hierarchical models and function estimation problems.  The investigators explore the use of Bayesian techniques for function estimation and their frequentist properties and use those properties to help choose appropriate noninformative priors.  One aspect of their study is the use of conditional autoregressive models (CAR) and their generalizations to capture spatial variability and as prior distributions in nonparametric regression and density estimation problems.  Preliminary results suggest good performance for the Bayesian smoothing parameter choice.  Using the fundamental relationship between penalized methods for function estimation and Bayesian estimation with high order CAR models as priors, they use sampling-based techniques (such as Markov chain Monte Carlo) to deal with problems with large amounts of data.  The regression and density estimation problems are special classes of hierarchical generalized linear models.  A common feature is the need to specify prior distributions for hyperparameters.  The investigators develop noninformative priors for these purposes and assess their suitability.  \r\n\r\nThe methods being developed are motivated by problems in transportation, disease mapping and wildlife management.  The transportation problem consists of modeling the behavior of residents in a city and their choice of activities and destinations.  The disease mapping work estimates disease incidence by location, age and gender strata.  The wildlife management issues involve similar problems in estimating hunting success rates for small areas such as counties.  All of these problems entail a spatial component, large data sets, and statistical inference to small regions.  There is a great deal of current interest in these topics, but many theoretical issues have not been addressed.  Results are being developed to help understand some of the theoretical properties of existing methods and to suggest new ones.  By using objective Bayesian techniques, new methodology is being developed to handle a wide range of practical problems.  These methods are computer intensive but feasible with the latest computer technology.\r\n\r\n",
