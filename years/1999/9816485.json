 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)/Junior Faculty Program will allow the Department of Chemistry at Regis University, a primarily undergraduate institution, to upgrade and install a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.  Stephen F. Cartier, a junior faculty member, will use this instrument to pursue fundamental research in the field of radical cation chemistry and introduce modern mass spectrometric techniques to the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.  His group will investigate diazoalkane and carbene radical cation systems using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry.  Student research assistants will learn the fundamentals of electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry and participate in data acquisition and analysis.  The department will also incorporate the mass spectrometer into upper level laboratory courses by adding several new experiments to the curriculum, including investigations of peptide sequencing, ionic transition-metal complexes, fullerenes and their derivatives, organic electrochemistry, and trace chemical detection.  \r\n\r\nMass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of electrospray ionization in combination with high resolution provides one of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of compounds. The acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is essential for carrying out frontier research in many fields of chemistry.\r\n\r\n",
