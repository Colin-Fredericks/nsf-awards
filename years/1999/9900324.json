In its\r\noriginal formulation, the fundamental lemma is an equality between\r\norbital integrals on two different algebraic groups.  In this project,\r\nthe fundamental lemma is translated into a statement relating the cohomology\r\nof two different pro-algebraic varieties.  Techniques are then developed\r\nfor computing these cohomology groups in such a way that they may be\r\ncompared with each other.  This procedure should result in a proof of\r\nthe fundamental lemma in the \"unramified case\", and may well eventually\r\nlead to a proof in the general case.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty years, mathematicians have directed tremendous\r\nefforts towards proving a collection of conjectures, due to R. Langlands,\r\nwhich unify several apparently very different fields:  number theory,\r\ngroup representation theory, and automorphic forms.  Each of these fields\r\nwould then benefit from being able to import techniques, problems, and \r\nresults from the other fields.  Progress on \r\nthese conjectures (which were at one time considered almost hopeless)\r\nhas been spectacular:  many of them are completely solved or\r\nverified and all of them have been checked in many special cases.  Even\r\nthese partial results are extremely important:  for example, A. Wiles'\r\nrecent and celebrated proof of the Fermat conjecture makes\r\nessential use of some of these results from \"Langlands' program.\"\r\nResearchers are now optimistic that this program may be successfully\r\ncompleted during the next decade.\r\n",
