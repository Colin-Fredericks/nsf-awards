The proposed research, in addition to exploring basic nuclear physics, will serve as a valuable means of introducing undergraduate students to scientific investigation.  Experiments will be completed at the University of Kentucky Van de Graaff Laboratory using the neutron scattering and gamma-ray detection facilities available there.  Data analyses will be completed by students and senior investigators using computational equipment located at the University of Dallas and at the United States Naval Academy.\r\n\r\nExperiments are proposed on Tellurium-126,128, and 130, to investigate the low-lying excitations of these nuclei.  This research is part of a systematic study of the stable isotopes of Tellurium to investigate the collective and particle nature of the excitations in these nuclei and how these structures evolve within this isotopic chain.  Gamma-ray angular distributions, Doppler shifts, coincidences, and excitation functions will be measured for transitions from levels in these nuclei up to an excitation energy of 3.3 MeV.  From these measurements, level schemes and decay characteristics will be determined.  Electromagnetic transition rates, branching ratios, and multipole-mixing ratios will deduced; these are extremely important for the comparison of models with experimental data.  \r\n",
