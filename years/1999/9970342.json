 "awd_abstract_narration": "9970342\r\n\r\nThis proposal deals with the  representation theory of reductive groups. The problems concern the relation of certain basic questions (arising in the Langlands program of automorphic forms) relating the nonvanishing of analytic invariants ( called automorphic L-functions) to the existence of functorial liftings conjectured in the Langlands program.  One very classical example of such phenomenon is the Waldspurger correspondence relating the existence of half integral weight forms to nonvanishing of classical L-functions at centers of symmetry.  We consider various methods of constructing functorial liftings. The program sets forth alternative methods to be studied.  The specific ideas used in these new methods include (1)the construction of new models for automorphic representations called Gelfand Graev models and (2) determination of tensor L-functions for the case of the direct product of GL(N) with a classical group.  We study formulae for certain specific values of automorphic L-functions and the construction of tempered L packets for classical groups.\r\n\r\nThis research is in the area of number theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of natural numbers.  It is among the oldest branches of mathematics.  Within the last half century it has become an indispensible tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems.\r\n",
