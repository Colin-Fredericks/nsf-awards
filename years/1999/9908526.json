 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will perform a feasibility study on the design of hybrid kinematic machines.  The goal of the design is to attain the advantages of both a serial kinematic machine and a parallel kinematic machine including:  (1) High-stiffness, low inertia, and high-speed capability, (2) Decoupled position and orientation tasks,  (3) Closed-form direct and inverse kinematics, (4) Simplified dynamical equations and control algorithm, 5) Large workspace (in comparison with a 6-degree-of-freedom fully parallel kinematic machine), and (6) Modular and reconfigurable machine architecture.  First, two different classes of position mechanisms, one with three and the other with four supporting limbs, will be enumerated.  Then, a comparison study of the machine stiffness, inertia, and workspace volume will be made.\r\n     This project is expected to advance the fundamental knowledge for design of high-stiffness, low-inertia, and high-speed precision machine tools.  The knowledge base developed by this work will not only benefit the machine tool industry but also the robotics community. \r\n\r\n",
