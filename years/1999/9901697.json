The Real-time and Embedded Linux (RED-Linux) \r\nkernel is designed to support applications that have both real-time and \r\nnon-real-time tasks with different QoS parameters. By integrating a \r\nmicro-timer and inserting preemption points in the kernel, RED-Linux will \r\nprovide a very short task dispatch latency and interrupt handling response \r\ntime. A unified scheduling framework for supporting various scheduling \r\nparadigms (such as priority-driven, time-driven and share-driven) will be \r\ninvestigated. New scheduling algorithms will be studied as a result of the \r\nunified scheduling framework. Different from previous real-time Linux \r\nprojects, RED-Linux will not implement a separate real-time kernel (which \r\nco-exists with the Linux kernel) to handle real-time tasks.  All real-time \r\nand non-real-time tasks are handled and scheduled by the same kernel. \r\nReal-time tasks are scheduled according to their real-time and QoS \r\nrequirements.  Non-real-time tasks are scheduled with a fair share of \r\nsystem time, sharing the resources used by real-time and other \r\nnon-real-time tasks. Finally, the project will investigate an open kernel \r\nstructure with modular components so that it can be used in different \r\nembedded system environments by integrating components with specific \r\ncapabilities.\r\n\r\n",
