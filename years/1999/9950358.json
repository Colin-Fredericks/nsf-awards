 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on development, evaluation, and national dissemination of instructional materials based on advances in undergraduate education and effective educational practices proven to enhance student learning. The three products of this project are \"Next Generation Lesson Plans,\" a bank of related concept-based questions, and a national information clearinghouse for a basic engineering science course - statics. These products have potential to be useful to thousands of statics instructors in implementing next-generation strategies for enhancing and assessing student learning.\r\n\r\nThe Next Generation Lesson Plans specify expected student outcomes and include mini-lecture outlines, readiness (or reading) quizzes, cooperative learning activities, and classroom assessment techniques. A bank of conceptual questions for readiness quizzes, cooperative learning exercises, attention quizzes, and tests support the implementation of the Next-Generation Lesson Plans. Conceptual questions target  all six levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. A National Statics Clearinghouse (NSC) containing information about, and links to, major publications, pedagogical advances, and course materials related to statics is under development. The NSC will provide \"one-stop shopping\" for instructors to find information and materials focused on the improvement in student learning in statics.\r\n\r\n",
