 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of the proposed research by Andras Vasy is the study of many-body\r\nscattering. The data from a scattering experiment are mathematically\r\nrepresented by the scattering matrices, or S-matrices. The central issue\r\nin many-body scattering is understanding the structure of these operators.\r\nA new method is now available for the analysis; it adopts techniques used\r\nfor the study of hyperbolic equations. This project will employ these\r\nmicrolocal techniques to analyze the wave front relation of the free-cluster\r\nto free-cluster scattering matrix in many-body scattering, involving\r\narbitrarily many particles, when the subsystems have no bound states.\r\nThis S-matrix represents scattering data when both the incoming and the\r\noutgoing particles are asymptotically free, i.e. they are not bound together.\r\nIts wave front relation describes the singularities of the outgoing data\r\nin terms of those of the incoming ones. More precisely, the main goal of the\r\npresent project is to prove that if the subsystems of a many-body system\r\nhave no bound states, e.g. if all potentials are non-negative, then the wave\r\nfront relation of the free-cluster to free-cluster S-matrix is given by\r\nthe broken geodesic flow to distance pi on the sphere. The absence of bound\r\nstates simplifies the phase space structure of the problem and hence\r\nprovides an ideal first step towards the understanding of the S-matrices\r\nin general. In addition, in this situation the problem is geometrically\r\nanalogous to the wave equation in domains with corners. Thus, the completion\r\nof the project will demonstrate that scattering is in many respects a\r\nhyperbolic problem, similar to the wave equation. The next step will be\r\nto analyze what happens if there are bound states in some subsystems;\r\nin this case one has to combine the behavior of bound states with the\r\nclassical dynamics to understand the propagation of singularities.\r\n\r\nIndeed, many people are familiar with the following two descriptions of\r\nthe propagation of light. First, in geometric optics, light propagates\r\nin straight lines, reflecting from surfaces according to Snell's law.\r\nThat is, the angles of incidence and of reflection are the same, as if\r\nlight consisted of little billiard balls. Second, light can be described by\r\nthe wave equation, its propagation thus being similar to that of water\r\nwaves. There are many ways in this particular example in which the first\r\npicture gives a rough description of the second, but the following\r\nconnection has particularly wide-ranging generalizations: singularities of\r\nthe amplitude of the wave (`sharp signals' or `jumps in signals') propagate\r\nalong light rays. The purpose of the current proposal is to investigate the\r\nanalogous relationship between classical and quantum mechanical particles,\r\nthat is, to analyze in what ways does the motion of classical particles,\r\nconsidered as little billiard balls colliding with each other, describe\r\nthe motion of quantum mechanical particles. In more concrete terms, how well\r\ndoes the motion of four billiard balls describe how four electrons collide\r\nwith each other? Since it is easier to analyze the corresponding properties\r\nof classical systems than those of quantum ones, just as it is easier to\r\ndescribe light moving in straight lines than to solve the wave equation,\r\nthe answer to this question significantly improves our understanding of\r\nquantum mechanics.\r\n",
