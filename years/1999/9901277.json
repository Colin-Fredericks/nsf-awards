The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Qinfeng Guo to work with Dr. Xingguo Han at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Xiangshan, Beijing, China and Dr. M. Kato at the University of Tokyo in Japan.  For support of the Japan portion, Dr. Guo has been nominated for an award under the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Program.  The Program will also support six months of this project in the United States at the University of Missouri under the direction of Dr. Robert E. Ricklefs.\r\nDr. Guo's research focuses on an important problem in plant geography and evolutionary biology, that of the origin of the North American disjunctions and the forces that drive evolution from presumably similar ancestors once the separation occurs.  He will assemble data available for the taxa from literature and herbaria and subject them to new statistical analyses.  The results will increase our understanding of the processes involved in the diversification of these lineages.  This project will give English speaking researchers access to data previously available only in Chinese and Japanese.\r\nDr. Han is director of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  He has organized several international botanical expeditions in China and Southeast Asia.  The Institute is the largest botanical research unit in China and has the largest herbarium in Asia.  Dr. Kato is very knowledgeable on all other Eastern Asia-North American disjunct plant taxa and his institution, the University of Tokyo has the largest herbarium and most comprehensive botanical literature collection in Japan.  Dr. Ricklefs has been active in the geographical analyses of biodiversity patterns.  His program works in conjunction with the Missouri Botany Garden.\r\n***\r\n",
