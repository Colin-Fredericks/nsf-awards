Main, Ph.D., University of Kentucky\r\nProposal # 9875781\r\nCAREER:  Ultra-Precision Shape Controlled Smart Structures\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nEngineering systems that require ultra-precision control of positions and shapes often use active materials as extremely precise actuators.  Many active materials respond to applied electric fields, which are conventionally applied by distributed electrodes.  In this investigation active material actuator technology is combined with an electron gun charge deposition system and the characteristics of the resulting shape and position control system explored.  The electron gun approach permits extremely accurate placement of control charges on the active material, thus making it possible to command strains and displacements at extremely precise locations in a piezoelectric structure.  The overall technical objective is the development of a thorough understanding of electron gun shape control of piezoelectric materials, including possible shape control limits, resolution, and dynamic behavior.  Both analytical and computation models are being developed and verified with experimental data.  The companion educational objective is to use the scientific investigation, which has significant mechanical, electrical, and control engineering components, to expose as many students as possible to the inherently multidisciplinary nature of modern engineering.\r\nAn actuation system that has the potential to be controllable at the nanometer level is explored in this research.  Potential applications for the technology developed in this project include active optics, micro-electro-mechanical systems, and micromanufacturing, which are all high value-added emerging industries.  Training of students at the graduate, undergraduate, and secondary levels is also a product of this work-a product that naturally adds to domestic capabilities in math, science, and engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
