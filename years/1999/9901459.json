The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Robert R. Hudgins to work with Professor Thomas Kiefhaber at the Biocenter of the University of Basel in Switzerland.\r\nDr. Hudgins will study the problem of protein folding. Specifically, he will look at the kinetics of simple model systems that represent the earliest stages of folding.  He will use triplet-triplet energy transfer and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to characterize the dynamics of polypeptide chains with different degrees of structural organization.  These will be benchmark studies from which the slower kinetics of true proteins can be fully understood.\r\nDr. Kiefhaber's lab has established a model system to study the dynamics of the earliest steps in protein folding using designed model peptides.  This is a perfect location for Dr. Hudgins as well, because the Biocenter is internationally recognized for its many biologically related research programs, and the city of Basel is an international center of biopharmaceutical companies.  He will be able to network with numerous researchers in addition to those in Dr. Kiefhaber's lab.\r\n***\r\n",
