The research will focus on designing a\r\nsoftware-implemented fault tolerance (SIFT) layer, Chameleon,\r\nwhich will provide fault tolerance services to user applications,\r\nmanage user processes across the network, provide rapid error\r\ndetection, and initiate recovery from errors in the hardware,\r\nthe operating system, applications, and the SIFT layer.  In other\r\nwords, Chameleon will protect all of the key components in a\r\ndistributed system, including itself.\r\n\r\nOur primary objective in developing Chameleon is to define\r\nand demonstrate the SIFT architecture, which includes static and\r\ndynamic reconfigurability and an extensive suite of error\r\ndetection and recovery protocols in an integrated environment.\r\n\r\nWe will investigate ways to make Chameleon both statically and\r\ndynamically reconfigurable.  Dynamic reconfigurability will allow\r\nChameleon to change the level of reliability services that it\r\nprovides during the lifetime of the target.  In addition,\r\nChameleon will be constructed to facilitate the creation of new\r\nfault tolerance techniques for the hardware, operating system,\r\nand applications.  For static reconfigurability, we envision\r\nproviding a library of fault tolerance techniques from which a\r\ncustomized fault tolerance solution can be provided to a target\r\napplication.  A specific solution will be composed of a range of\r\ndistributed error detection and recovery techniques to provide\r\nthe level of dependability required by the application.\r\n",
