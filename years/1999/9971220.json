 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971220\r\n\r\nThere is a close relationship between certain critical exponents, the intersection exponents, for Brownian motion and random walk and the geometric and fractal properties of the paths.  This investigator will study the intersection exponent in two dimensions, in particular trying to use conformal invariance to prove exact values of the exponents that have been conjectured using nonrigorous conformal field theory.  The ideas will also be applied to continuum limits of other models in critical phenomenon in statistical physics.  The goal is to give rigorous arguments using conformally invariant measures on paths for conjectures derived from conformal field theory.  The investigator will also consider appropriate conditions on random walks so that their critical behavior, i.e., their exponents, are the same as for Brownian motion.\r\n\r\nA number of systems in two dimensional statistical physics at criticality, i.e., at or near the temperature at which there is a phase transition, are conjectured to have the property of conformal invariance in the limit.  By assuming conformal invariance it is often possible to give exact predictions for certain quantities called critical exponents which describe the qualitative behavior of the systems.  Neither the conformal invariance assumption nor the predictions of the exponents assuming the conformal invariance has been mathematically justified.  The investigator will look at a particular system, intersections of Brownian motion paths, and try to compute these exponents rigorously.  He will then extend these ideas to more general systems that satisfy conformal invariance.\r\n",
