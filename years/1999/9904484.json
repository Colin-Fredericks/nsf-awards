The scientists plan to evaluate various aspects of using recycled concrete as the aggregate for new concrete.  They plan to study bond behavior and durability of recycled concrete. They will prepare concrete mixtures using two types of recycled aggregates and one conventional natural aggregate that is similar to the one present in the original concrete before it was recycled.  The mixtures will be evaluated for workability, compressive strength, chloride-ion penetration test, bond with reinforcing steel rebars, fracture behavior  and potential alkali-aggregate reaction behavior. The study is to include analytical and experimental components.  Finite Element Analysis (FEA) will be used to study the bond and fracture behavior of recycled concrete.\r\n\r\nScope: This study may provide information that can be used in codes of practice for recycled concrete in the US and elsewhere. Professor McCabe is well known to the research community for his work in areas related to the project.  Both investigators have extensive experience and expertise in the area of the proposed research and are well qualified to conduct the project. They have collaborated on research projects in the past, and will benefit from the proposed collaboration.  They have access to the needed facilities.  The impact of this study will be economic and also environmental, with potential impact on the concrete industry.  The scientists plan to set a web site at the University of Kansas and AUC to facilitate the dissemination of the project findings over the Internet.  A US graduate student will participate in the research, and will gain experience in international scientific activities.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
