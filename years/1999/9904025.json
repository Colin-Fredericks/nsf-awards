 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Patricia Urban and Edward Schortman will conduct two seasons of archaeological survey and excavation in the Cacautapa Valley in Northern Honduras. In the course of previous survey work Schortman and Urban discovered a massive prehistoric center near the modern town of Pueblo Nuevo. Termed \"La Coyota\", it is spread over roughly .75 km square of high terrace. While dense vegetation has precluded making a clear assessment of the center's form and dimensions, it is clearly a major site. It is dominated by a monumental core located on its northeastern margin with sizable quantities of stone-faced platforms stretching out to the South. Several massive stone terraces were built to support putative residential groups against the foot of the steep northwestern slopes. The concentration of structures implies a significant degree of political concentration with a powerful elite able to settle large numbers of subordinates in close proximity. Based on correlations between ecology and social structure from other regions in Honduras, this concentration of population is surprising because supporting agricultural land is located in relatively small scattered patches which would increase the difficulty an elite would have in exercising direct and tight social control. The goal of this research is to understand the processes which led to the nucleation and centralization which La Coyota  clearly indicates did exit. The investigators believe that it was the site's central geographic position in relation to rivers and mountain passes and its through control of trade that political centralization was achieved. \r\n\r\n     To evaluate this hypothesis, the team will conduct a survey of all prime agricultural land to determine its distribution and the nature of prehistoric human habitation on it. All sites will be noted and their size established. Surface materials will be collected. Extensive excavation will be conducted at La Coyota and at a sample of rural settlements. Extensive lateral clearing will be conducted within patio groups both to increase sample size and to determine the spatial distribution of activities. Through examination of the distribution and intensity of craft production insight will be gained into the degree of central control.\r\n\r\n     This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on how social complexity arises and is maintained. It will provide data on a virtually unknown region of Middle America and it will assist in training many undergraduate students.\r\n",
