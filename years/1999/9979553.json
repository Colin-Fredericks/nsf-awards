 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this three-year project, twenty six Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, and Biology graduate students and twelve advanced undergraduates from the University of Kansas (KU) are participating in a Teaching Fellows program focusing on the Kansas City Kansas (KCK) Public School District. The Fellows provide in-service and in-class support for middle and high school science and mathematics teachers on three levels: 1) technology training and knowledge transfer for a new generation of teachers implementing inquiry- and problem-based curricula, 2) assistance for teachers  and student teams who are implementing standards-based curricula, and 3) curriculum enhancement and knowledge transfer in support of research- and problem-based curriculum units for mathematics, life science, and physical science classes. Fellows work directly with teachers in planning and training sessions to prepare content support and increase technology expertise for KCK District teachers. Each Fellow attends a one-week pre-assignment training workshop and a university-level course covering best practices in K-12 teaching, multicultural education, and cognitive skill development. This project is helping the KCK Schools implement a new advanced science graduation requirement and accomplish a long-term District goal, instituted under an NSF-funded TEAMs project, to improve mathematics and science instruction. This project is assisting KU by building collaborations with teachers in the KCK public schools and by establishing a mechanism for attracting students from underrepresented and disadvantaged groups into mathematics, science, and engineering majors. Teaching Fellows will graduate from KU with an unusually deep understanding of science and mathematics pedagogy, K-12 teaching, and multicultural education.\r\n",
