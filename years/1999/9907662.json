 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Mississippi Field Station (UMFS), established at Bay Springs 18 km northeast of The University's main campus in 1986, is a research facility in northern Mississippi dedicated to long-term ecological research.  Staff, visiting investigators, and students conduct research in disciplines as diverse as hydrology, botany, soil science, genetics, herpetology, pharmacology, toxicology, ecology, limnology, fisheries biology, and physiology.  Use of the facility is often intense.  Areas of research strength emphasize ecosystem processes.  Complementary education programs involve research training for graduate and undergraduate students, use by college classes, and K-12 and community environmental education.  UMFS supports research and education by providing access to study areas and organisms on its 740 acre (296 ha.) preserve.  The Station's 223 research ponds, five spring ponds, and 220 acres (90 ha.) of associated upland habitat are among its greatest assets.\r\n\r\nAs articulated during the 1997 planning workshop, the overall vision for UMFS is to become a regionally, nationally, and internationally important station for  field research, teaching and service over the next 18 years.  The Center for Water and Wetland Resources (CWWR) at UMFS represents a major step towards fulfilling this goal.  The May 2000 dedication ceremony for the CWWR complex  will coincide with UMFS-hosted international conference on wetlands.  The dedication ceremony and the conference are envisioned to attract much interest in the scientific community.  The response to date has been very encouraging.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous recommendations offered by the 1997 workshop participants two are developed in the proposal.  Construction of housing and construction of a Multipurpose-Fabrication Building for The University of Mississippi Field Station will be supported by this project.  Field Stations are often defined by having resident scientists and students on site conducting research throughout the year.  Visiting scientists and researchers from other parts of the globe can be encouraged to visit UMFS by providing on-site housing.  The Multipurpose-Fabrication Building will also serve as a field and lab/equipment design, development and maintenance shop.  There are currently no facilities on site to build or repair equipment needed for research use.  A Fabrication Lab would also serve as an area to house all of the existing equipment currently at the Field Station.  A building that can provide such practical convenience is essential to the mission of the Station in providing support for educational and research activities. \r\n",
