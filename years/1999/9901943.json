 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silver and Ruvinsky 9901943\r\n\tAccording to the fossil record, limb evolution of modern vertebrates from their limbless chordate ancestors proceeded in two major steps.  A set of paired appendages was initially acquired at the pectoral level.  This was followed by reiteration of a limb-outgrowth program at a\r\ndifferent axial level, giving rise to the second, pelvic, set.  However, the genetic systems associated with this process remain unknown.  We have recently discovered a novel gene family, the T-box genes, some of which are important for determining limb identity in tetrapods.  We established that a gene duplication resulting in the origin of limb-specific T-box genes happened roughly at the same time as the transition from one to two sets of paired appendages.  Therefore, we decided to investigate the connection between evolution of the T-box family and morphological evolution of vertebrates.\r\n\tWe will attempt to isolate the T-box genes from \"lower\" vertebrates (jawless fishes and sharks) and the closest relative of vertebrates (amphioxus) to test the hypothesis that gene duplications temporally coincided with the advent of the second set of paired appendages.  We will examine genomic loci of the genes thought to be coordinately regulated to test for the evidence of  selection maintaining close linkage.  Finally, by investigating expression patterns of duplicated genes we will test a link between functional divergence and morphological evolution.\r\n\tThe data acquired during this project will likely shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying this critical step in vertebrate evolution.\r\n",
