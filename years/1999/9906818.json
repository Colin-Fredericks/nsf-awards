 "awd_abstract_narration": "Auditory representation of data, or sonification, promises gains in the representation of temporal and high-dimensional data, in data monitoring tasks where the eyes are busy, in tasks requiring recognition of patterns in a data set, in high-stress or critical conditions where cross-modal correlations would be of value, and where the display users are students or researchers with visual disabilities.   However, very little work has been done to determine the best ways to map data dimensions, such as temperature or pressure, onto auditory display dimensions, such as pitch or tempo.   We also know little about the metaphorical associations that sounds create, and how to utilize these connotations to design effective, compelling, and pleasant sonifications which are easy to learn and intuitive to use.  This research seeks to discover the optimal data-to-display mappings for use in scientific sonification, and to investigate whether these optimal mappings vary within and/or across fields of application.  To accomplish this, the PI and his team will develop a cross-platform research environment that incorporates sophisticated sound synthesis and data collection capabilities.    A series of experiments will investigate:   (a) listener preferences and population stereotypes in data-to-sound mappings;   (b) how mappings differ across various scientific areas; and (c) the effectiveness of data sonification for graphical interpretations and data mining.   The PI will develop a cross-platform sonification software tool to create auditory displays suitable for the domain of study, the characteristics of the user, and the type of data to be explored.  This tool will facilitate data analysis in a number of disciplines, and provide visually-disabled scientists and students immediate inroads into the world of science.",
