 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project involves theoretical and empirical research into the workings of a number of specific industries. The studies are intended to improve our understanding of the industries involved, and, more broadly, to help assess the relevance of a number of economic theories of strategic behavior.\r\n     One empirical study is a study of mutual funds. The project will involve analysis of the turnover of managers of mutual funds and of the behavior of fund managers. The main goal is to see whether managers' desires to avoid getting fired may distort their portfolio decisions. More generally, mutual funds provide a nice opportunity to explore \"career concerns\" in a real world setting. Another object of study is the pharmaceutical industry. Here, the focus will be on strategic actions which firms take as their patents are about to expire and they face impending generic entry. Another study will look at data from a large number of industries to try to understand the dynamics of how Silicon Valley-style concentrations of individual manufacturing industries arise, decline and move.\r\n     On the theoretical side models of two dynamic phenomena will be developed. The first is the evolution of quality standards in communities. It will focus on how standards, which are set in a decentralized manner, tend to evolve over time (with the prototypical example being the dramatic slowdown over the last twenty-five years in the economics publication process). The second concerns the frequency of computer software upgrades which (along with improving the quality of the products) create incompatibilities and cause some users to incur unwanted training costs.\r\n",
