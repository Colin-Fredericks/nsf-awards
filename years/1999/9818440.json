 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exposure to stress elicits a characteristic activation of glucocorticoid secretion by the adrenal gland.  Glucocorticoids act to mobilize bodily resources, promoting physiological and psychological adaptation and thereby enhancing survival.   The glucocorticoid stress response exhibits a profound sexual dimorphism, marked by significantly greater secretion in females than in males.  At present, neuronal circuits underlying this gender difference are poorly understood. To address this critical issue, the present proposal uses a rat model to study the impact of gender and female gonadal steroids on central nervous system control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical stress axis.  Objective 1 shall test the hypothesis that estrogen mediates increases in stress excitability through defined actions on anatomical pathways controlling adrenocortical secretions. Objective 2 will document connections between estrogen-receptive and adrenocortical regulatory cell populations, and use intracranial administration to identify specific central sites of estrogen action. This set of experiments will provide the first detailed analysis of how cross-talk between adrenocortical and gonadal hormones is accomplished within the central nervous system. Knowledge of the neurocircuitry mediating estrogen effects on stress hormone secretion will advance understanding of the role of gonadal steroids in brain function, and provide novel insight as to how stress is processed differently in male and females.",
