 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, we propose to undertake research in the areas of nonlinear control and system identification.  Our objectives is to provide computational methods for analysis and design of systems that incorporates both identification and control in a unified fashion.\r\n\r\nIn the area of nonlinear control, the emphasis will be placed on developing computational tools for classes of nonlinear systems that limit the complexity of the analysis and design problems.  We will build on our previous work that focused on finding appropriate control-Lyapunov-functions (Lfs) for the class of quasi-linear-parameter-varying systems to derive systematic tools for achieving more ambitious performance objectives.  We will also explore further the area of Neuro-dynamic programming to investigate the potential of computing controllers in real time, as well as deriving appropriate CLFs.  We also propose to develop analysis tools for piecewise linear systems and extend that to classes of Hybrid systems (mixed continuous dynamics with logic).\r\n\r\nIn the area of system identification, we propose to build on our previous work to develop a complete theory for identifying simple models of  possibly complex systems.  This theory should provide computable algorithms with associated non-conservative error bounds, experimental inputs, and estimates of sample complexity for accurate identification.  We propose to extend our previous work to handle a larger class of model parametrizations as well as certain classes of nonlinear systems.  This approach is will integrated with robust control approaches and provides a nice tradeoff between parametric and non-parametric uncertainty that is quite essential in quantifying the performance of a feedback system\r\n",
