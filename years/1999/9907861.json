 "awd_abstract_narration": "Between the ages of one and three, children undergo a remarkable \r\nimprovement in their ability to realize that a word, a picture, or some \r\nother symbol such as a model can stand for or represent another object or \r\narray. This representational insight is a central and pervasive aspect of \r\nhuman thinking. For example, we see representational capacities being \r\ndisplayed when a preschooler engages in imaginative play, and in the \r\nolder child, when he or she understands that the words printed on a piece \r\nof paper refer to some event, feature, or other aspect of the world. The \r\nability to understand symbols, and what they refer to, is a powerful \r\nintellectual ability that underlies much of human communication, \r\nthinking, and problem solving.\r\n\r\n\tSome representational abilities emerge over a very short period \r\nin early development. To illustrate, if a child 30 months of age \r\nis asked to watch as a toy is hidden behind a piece of furniture in a \r\nroom and is then instructed to find a similar toy now hidden behind an \r\nidentical, but much smaller piece of furniture in a model of that room \r\n(about the size of a doll house), he or she will have great difficulty \r\ndoing so. A 3-year-old, however, just six months older displays this type of \r\ntransfer very easily. The difficulty for the younger child is not \r\nmerely one of forgetting where the toy was hidden initially since he or \r\nshe can easily find the original toy when asked to do so. The problem for \r\nthe younger child seems to be in appreciating that the model represents \r\nthe large room and, thus, in understanding that information provided in \r\nthe first array (the room) can be transferred and help in searching for \r\nthe toy located in the second array (the model).\r\n\r\n\tYounger children, however, show systematic biases in their search \r\nbehavior. For example, they often look in the location on the transfer \r\ntask where they previously found the toy in an earlier search, and these \r\nkinds of biases may interfere with their representational insight. \r\nSeveral studies are outlined to eliminate the influence of these biases \r\nand to examine whether tasks that involve the initiation of distinctive \r\nactions and imitative behaviors, rather than search for an object, \r\nprovide a more effective way to demonstrate transfer and representational \r\ncapacities in very young children. In addition, new types of transfer \r\nsituations are created to assess whether the representational limitations \r\nextend to tasks involving any large array and a model of it or are \r\nuniquely associated with spaces such as rooms (within which the child \r\nmoves about) and models of rooms (where the child surveys or overlooks \r\nthe entire space). The findings will provide a more complete \r\nunderstanding of the early representational competencies of very young \r\nchildren and help to identify the factors that contribute to learning \r\nand transfer involving symbols and their referents.",
