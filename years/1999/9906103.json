 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial funding for a conference titled Optimization in Industry.  The conference will be held from June 6-11, 1999, at Banff in Alberta, Canada.   Its goal is to bring together about 70 researchers from industry, university and Government both in the US and foreign nations.  The attendees will pool their knowledge and expertise towards furthering the use of optimization in industry, specifically as they relate to distributed design and manufacturing and the associated ramifications upon design theory and high-speed computing.   The objectives of the conference include facilitating in-depth discussions involving a review of fundamental work done in the field, assessing the present state of research and practice and thence identifying promising new and innovative activities that will lead to an increased use of optimization in industry.\r\n     This conference should help the optimization research and practice communities identify elements of design theory that need to be developed to support distributed design with high-speed computing at its core and the development of optimization techniques of value to industry.  The successful use of such techniques by industry will result in better products at lower costs.\r\n",
