 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a study to develop CO measurements in our laboratory, focusing on identifying and eliminating potential sources of contamination. Preliminary measurements for specific periods of climatic interest to lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies of CO records in ice cores will also be made. The proponents plan to test the following time periods:\r\n\r\n1) The transition from the pre- to post-anthropogenic period (1500-1950 AD). This record will address the question of how the atmospheric CO concentration has changed with anthropogenic activity and verify the initial results of Haan et al. (1996) and Haan and Raynaud 1998.\r\n\r\n2)\tThe last 20,000 years, including the re-industrial Holocene, the deglaciation, and the last glacial maximum. This record will address the question of how CO changed during periods of major climate change. Did CO behave like C02, which changed slowly on these time scales, or like CH4, which changed very quickly.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that the CO record, combined with existing or new data for C02, CH4, N20, and other paleoclimate variables, will provide further constraints on model studies of the effect of changing atmospheric chemistry on greenhouse forcing. This project furthermore contributes to areas of emphasis in the ESH program, including \"compilation of high quality physical, chemical, and biological paleorecords focusing on climatic,  an environmental changes,\" and \"quantification and development of biotic, physical, and geochemical proxy indicators for past Earth system processes.. .\"\r\n",
