 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powerful winds and jets are among the most dramatic manifestations of accreting black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN).  Recent consideration of the energetics of accretion flows suggests that such outflows are not only inevitable, but that the mass loss may be so strong that all but a tiny fraction of the supplied matter is expelled before it reaches the black hole.  This project studies the theoretical ramifications and observational consequences of this new view of accretion in AGN.  Although the loss of mass, angular momentum, and energy are interrelated in a predictable way, the specifics of the outflows depend on microphysical details. Dr. Begelman is constructing \"inflow-outflow\" models, calculating their radiative properties, and studying their relationships to the production and collimation of relativistic jets as well as their interactions with the AGN environment.\r\n\r\nThe relativistic jets in AGNs may be one consequence of powerful mass loss from the inner parts of accretion flows, but the jets could also derive much of their energy from the spin of the black hole.  Dr. Begelman is also studying how the extraction of spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek effect depends on the black hole's accretion history and its current environment.  Dr. Begelman is also studying the braod z-ray iron lines and relativistic \"diskoseismology\" - the study of trapped oscillations in the inner regions of accretions disks - as observational probes of strong gravity regions close to black holes.  \r\n***\r\n",
