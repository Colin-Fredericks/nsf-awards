It provides a basis for developing universal methods for depositing nanostructures: linear arrays of nanoclusters or molecules, single atom rows, and insulated metal stripes on silicon. The new features in the electronic structure of these one- and two-dimensional arrays will be determined by a variety spectroscopies, such as angle- and spin-resolved photoemission, inverse photoemission, core level absorption and fluorescence, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The research students in this program are exposed to state- of-the-art surface science and thin film growth techniques. They are learning fundamental materials physics, while learning how to direct creative research in ways that may lead to advanced technological  applications.\r\n%%% \r\nThis research project deals with fabrication of tailored materials that are assemble by decorating regular arrays of atomic steps. New patterning methods will be developed where atoms, molecules, or clusters arrange themselves spontaneously at a stepped crystal surface. The research students in this program are exposed to state of the art surface science and thin film growth techniques. They are learning fundamental materials physics, while learning how to direct creative research in ways that may lead to advanced technological  applications.\r\n",
