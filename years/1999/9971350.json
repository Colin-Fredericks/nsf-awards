The investigator will continue to study\r\nthe universal finite type invariant of homology 3-spheres which he\r\ndeveloped in joint work with J. Murakami and T. Ohtsuki. In\r\nparticular, he plans to develop the theory further to include\r\nother 3-manifolds and to study the topological quantum field\r\ntheory associated with the Le-Murakmi-Ohtsuki invariant which is\r\ndifferent from those associated with usual quantum invariants.  He\r\nwill try to understand the topology of these new invariants and\r\nfind their applications. One of the projects is to study relations\r\nbetween the hyperbolic, or more general, simplicial, volume of\r\nknots and their quantum invariants (to prove the\r\nKashaev-Murakami-Murakami conjecture).\r\n\r\nThe theory of knots and 3-manifolds is an old branch of\r\nmathematics which has gained renewed interest among mathematicians\r\nand physicists after the discovery of the Jones polynomial and its\r\nrelation to theoretical physics (quantum field theory, high energy\r\nphysics). In fact,  it is now one of the most active domains in\r\nmathematics. Many results of knot theory may also find\r\napplications in molecular biology. To classify knots and\r\n3-manifolds, mathematicians use \"invariants\". This research\r\nproject studies new classes of invariants of knots and 3-manifolds\r\nand their relationships with the classical ones. The new\r\ninvariants are very powerful in distinguishing knots and\r\n3-manifolds.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
