Kurup \r\nUniversity of Massachusetts, Lowell \r\n\r\nCAREER:  Innovative Technologies for Expedited Site Characterization in the New Millennium \r\n\r\nABSTRACT   \r\n\r\nThis CAREER award supports integrated research and education to pioneer novel methodologies for rapid and versatile site characterization of the geomedia.  With the great emphasis placed today on environmental monitoring, assessment and remediation needs, there has been substantial efforts concentrated on advancing a popular in situ methodology, the cone penetration test (CPT), for geoenvironmental sensing and assessment.  The Principal Investigator will develop an innovative Modular Integrated ConE (MICE) penetration test methodology for rapidly sniffing and characterizing contaminants in the subsurface, in real-time.  \"MICE\" will be developed by integrating a recently developed \"Electronic Nose\" technology with the \"CPT\" technology.  The electronic nose technology is based on combining modern developments in chemical sensors with artificial neural networks (ANN), for automated odor identification.  The various phases involved in the research plan include: the development of sensor arrays, ANN models and graphical visualization tools, laboratory training and pattern recognition, calibration chamber testing, field implementation and in situ testing.  \"MICE\" is envisioned to provide assessment solutions, and expedite characterization of the growing number of contaminated sites in the country (and around the world).  The educational component of this plan is multifold.  Through innovative instructional techniques the PI will creatively involve graduate, undergraduate and high school students (from typically underrepresented and minority groups) in the various phases of the proposed plan.  Undergraduate and graduate students will also participate in incorporating research findings into existing and new geotechnical/geoenvironmental engineering courses.  The PI will develop a new course entitled \"Geotechnical and Environmental Site Characterization\".  This course, directly related to the proposed research, will be offered to other campuses via live, two way interactive, audio-video, Distance Learning technologies.  The PI will build a dynamic partnership involving interdisciplinary research centers, academia, and state agencies to enhance the research and educational plans.  The results from this career development plan will be broadly disseminated to a broad spectrum of audience, to enhance their scientific and technological understanding.  This plan is envisioned to further the global frontiers of knowledge and technology in the area of site characterization.  The PI will keep pace with future developments in cross-disciplinary areas to innovate education and enhance site assessment technologies in the 21st century.    \r\n",
