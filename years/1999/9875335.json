 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nProfessor William Green will develop algorithmic and molecular modeling methodology to predict the kinetics of complex reaction systems such as combustion of fuels and partial oxidation of hydrocarbons and small amines and nitriles. Transition state theory and scattering theory will allow a priori calculation of individual rate constants. Selected constants will be experimentally validated primarily by overall reaction rate measurement and laser flash photolysis of reactive intermediates. Thus a combination of group additivity, quantum calculations and limited experimental data will be used to estimate unknown rate constants, including their uncertainty. A simulation algorithm --already implemented--  will allow the construction of complex reaction schemes by identifying the kinetically significant species.  The focus will be on the free-radical chemistry of small organic molecules in the gas phase and in weakly interacting solvents. Such is most important in oxidation and pyrolysis, but is also relevant to materials synthesis (e.g., plasma-enhanced CVD) and photo-remediation of pollutants. The educational portion of the grant will entail the development of a new graduate course in predictive chemical kinetics emphasizing molecular simulation, as well as modules for the existing undergraduate courses at MIT. Dissemination will be done via a web-site. The impact of this grant is expected to occur in the chemical, fuel, and environmental protection industries, as well as in engineering education.\r\n",
