Ten teacher/student teams and twenty national students will be recruited each year.  A total of thirty local secondary teachers with 30 local secondary students and 60 national secondary students will be divided into four person teams consisting of one teacher/student pair from the same school and two national students.  These teams will conduct six-week mathematics explorations in number theory in a resident camp during the first year.  In the following academic year the teachers will participate in sixteen half-day workshops developing curricular materials, as well as offer a research and problem-solving seminar at their school.  A website for student research, publication and communication will be developed.  Teachers and students can return for a seond year of advanced research.\r\n",
