 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nA decision-maker choosing a course of action typically does not know with\r\ncertainty the consequence of any chosen action. However, if she knows\r\nenough about the likelihoods of the various consequences that she can\r\nassign probabilities to them, then she can use these to weight the benefits\r\nand costs of any action and thereby rank alternative actions. In such\r\nsituations, we describe the choice problem as one of risk and the decision\r\nprocedure is the well-known expected utility theory. However, in many\r\nsettings, particularly in a new or changing decision environment, there may\r\nnot be much information available on which to base the assignment of\r\nprobabilities. Then we refer to the situation as one of ambiguity. This project is concerned with modeling decision-making under ambiguity.\r\n\t\r\nIn the early 1920's both Keynes and Frank Knight suggested the importance of the distinction between risk and ambiguity and the prevalence of the\r\nlatter, while Ellsberg, in his famous 1961 experiment, showed that the\r\ndistinction was empirically meaningful. This project will focus on the\r\nprecise formal meaning of ambiguity. In particular, it will address the\r\nquestion ``how can we tell from behavior that the decision-maker views a\r\nprospect as ambiguous rather than risky?'' Then it will examine the\r\nconsequences for the theory of financial markets of modeling asset returns\r\nas involving not only risk but also ambiguity. It is to be expected that\r\nsuch a theory would deliver, as one component underlying asset prices, a\r\npremium for bearing ambiguity in addition to the traditional premium for bearing risk.\r\n",
