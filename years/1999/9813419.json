Pheromones are compounds released by one individual to affect the behavior of another individual. Female moths use sex pheromones for the long-range attraction of Nonspecific males. These sex pheromones are species-specific blends of chemicals biosynthesized and released by female moths. While pheromone identification, production, and reception in moths is well-studied, basic questions remain on how this communication system has evolved and how these chemicals are biosynthesized. The researchers propose to identify how the female moths (Herald moth, Scoliopteryx libatrix, and Gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar) make a hydrocarbon pheromone component. While several groups of moths use hydrocarbons exclusively as sex pheromones, the biosynthesis of moths that are targets of this research have unique methyl branched and unsaturated pheromone components and their biosynthesis has not be identified in any insect. As a result of the proposed collaboration, the researchers will be identifying unique biosynthetic pathways for the production of these sex pheromone components.\r\n\r\nThis research in entomology fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\r\n",
