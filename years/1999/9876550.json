 "awd_abstract_narration": "In studies of status rankings in knowledge-producing communities, organizations and task groups, there is strong evidence that subjective assessments are profoundly socially influenced. Social scientists working on these topics have frequently concluded that the uncertainties inherent in quality judgments gives rise to a self-reinforcing process in which groups adhere to, reproduce and thereby validate socially provided assessments. This project develops a formal model that reflects and elaborates this mechanism, capturing the tension between a hypothesized concern for relational symmetry and the self-reinforcing status mechanism referred to above. A key difference between the proposed model and those extant in the network literature is that it offers an explanatory account of observed structure (a distribution of status positions) without assuming a pre-existing underlying structure. Formalizing the model permits the derivation of specific hypotheses regarding the interaction between collective attributions of status, reciprocity considerations, and individual positions in the structure of status attributions. These will be tested using a data set consisting of the network of opinion citations of U.S. appellate court judges. Confirmation of the hypotheses would indicate that the development of judge-made law is governed in part by the structural logic of status attributions, not just by the inherent quality or importance of the opinions themselves.",
