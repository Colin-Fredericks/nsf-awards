 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with the role of step and edge defects on the chemistry and growth of metal thin films.  Using elastic and inelastic helium atom scattering methods, combined with spot profile anaylsis low energy electron diffraction studies, Professor Barbara J.  Hinch and her coworkers at Rutgers University examine the motion of steps during thin film growth, and the adsorption and reaction of molecules at these step defects. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research, these diffraction probes combined with the real space structural probe of scanning tunneling microscopy to provide models for the reaction and diffusion of step edges, primarily on aluminum thin film surfaces.  Growth of these films from atomic sources as well as the chemical vapor deposition of aluminum from organometallic precursors such as trimethylamine alane is explored, with a view to developing technologically important information about the growth process.\r\n\r\nThe fabrication of electronic devices involves the growth of thin films of metals on various substrates.  This growth process is often controlled by the presence of step edge defects on the surface.  This research project obtains fundamental information about the nature and dynamics of these step edge defects, and assesses their role in the growth of thin film materials.  This fundamental work has a clear connection to technologically important areas of microelectronic device fabrication.",
