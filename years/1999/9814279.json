While work on our knowledge of the network structure of the universe has been rapidly growing over the past 20 years, there have been only rudimentary attempts to convey this information to the public because of the technical complexities that have made it a challenge to create an accurate display that is understandable by the lay person.  New technological advances have greatly allieviated that problem.  The high resolution animation in the series is being created by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.  This prime-time television series will be produced in high-definition television and will be broadcast as part of the NOVA series on PBS.  Ancillary material for use by viewers and schools is being developed by the Museum of Science in Boston.\r\n\r\n\tAdditional project elements will include a set of half-hour programs called \"What's Up in the Universe\" for younger viewers.  This series begins with discoveries of the properties of the Earth, then steps outward progressively until by the sixth program the audience is introduced to the scale of the universe.  A paper and CD-ROM Atlas of the Nearby Universe provides easy access to important information and views of the universe and will allow users to choose from an index of rendered flights through space.\r\n",
