 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Anthony's research focuses on the design and synthesis of organic materials for electronic devices.  The synthetic work involves the preparation of graphite oligomers by the derivatization, cyclization, and aromatization of alkynylnaphthalenes and -thiophenes.  The reactions to be employed include particularly the Bergman cyclization of arenediynes.  The target molecules are polyaromatic compounds having a variety of shapes, whose physical properties are a matter of some conjecture.  Professor Anthony is particularly interesting in testing these new materials as FET's (Field-Effect Transistors).  The classroom goals of Professor Anthony are to motivate students to become better learners by putting them in situations where they will need -- and want -- to uncover the knowledge required to solve a particular problem.  For instance, guiding the student through the properties of functional groups in an enzyme active site will enable the formulation of a \"drug\" molecule having complementary functional groups.  The students then might wonder how to synthesize their (own) \"drug\" molecule, which leads them into the panoply of organic synthetic transformations.  Upper level course development includes incorporation of the latest supramolecular and materials chemistry.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Synthetic Organic Program supports the research and educational activities of Dr. John Anthony of the Chemistry Department of the University of Kentucky.  Dr. Anthony's research efforts center on the creation of graphite-like structures on a molecular level that have exacting sizes and shapes.  Of the several applications of materials that make up these molecules, electronic devices such as field-effect transistors are among the most exciting.  Professor Anthony's teaching endeavors rely on new ways to put the student in charge of their own learning, using strategies based on student design of a pharmaceutical molecule and the challenge of planning its synthesis. Upper-level curricular offerings  will be invigorated by an infusion of the latest materials and supramolecular chemistry.",
