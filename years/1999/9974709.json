 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fast axonal transport, the anterograde and retrograde movement of vesicles and mitochondria in the neuronal axon, is a fundamental process in nerve cells.  It is now well established that the transport of vesicles requires cytoskeletal filaments (both microtubules and actin microfilaments) and molecular motors (kinesin, dynein, and myosin).  It is also well established that vesicles are targeted to either the axon or dendrites to maintain cell polarity, and that anterograde and retrograde transport are coordinated to maintain the proper distribution of organelles throughout the cell.\r\n\r\nThe long-term objectives of this project are to determine the role of myosin and actin filaments in fast axonal transport. In particular, the role of myosin V in vesicle transport will be determined. Recently published data from Dr. Langford's laboratory has shown that myosin V transports ER vesicles in the squid giant axon. \r\n\r\nThe specific aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that the membrane receptor for myosin V is a member of the protein 4.1 family of proteins and that the DIL motif of myosin V is involved in its binding to vesicles. Several approaches to determine the membrane proteins to which myosin binds will be used: (1) Affinity column chromatography will be performed with a synthetic peptide used to produce the myosin-V function-blocking antibody. Extracts of axoplasm and squid brain homogenates will be passed over the column and specific interacting proteins recovered. (2) Cross-linking reagents will be used to couple myosin V to its binding partners in the vesicle membrane and co-immunoprecipitation will be used to isolate the myosin\r\ncomplex. (3) Dominant-negative constructs will be expressed to determine whether the DIL motif represents the membrane binding sequence. The full-length clone of squid myosin-V has been obtained by RT-PCR. The myosin-V gene will be fused to GFP and the fusion construct ligated into an expression vector for myosin V expression in cultured cells.  The three experimental plans of this specific aim will be conducted in parallel. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
