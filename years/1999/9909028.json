To facilitate the enhancement of the knowledge of students in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (SMET) the following objectives have been proposed for this program: (1) reduce the attrition rate of students in gateway (SMET) courses by two fold, (2) establish a technology based resource center that supports students and teachers, (3) increase the infusion of technology in all phases of SMET instruction, (4) increase the number of SMET students participating in Internship and Co-op Programs by 250% and (5) develop a bridge program between high school students and Albany State University (ASU).\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the goal and objectives that have been established for this initiative will increase the number of graduating seniors through the enactment of strategies which will enhance the retention and recruitment of underrepresented minority students who earn baccalaureate degrees in the sciences and mathematics. Additionally, competencies will be provided to those students matriculating in special programs (e.g. Pre-engineering) who transfer to other baccalaureate granting institutions. The students will concentrate their studies in various programs in science, mathematics, pre-engineering and technology areas in which minorities have traditionally been underrepresented. Targeted students will also include ASU Summer Bridge (high school students entering ASU'S summer [2000] semester class) participants and SMET majors who are presently enrolled.\r\n",
