Low power digital electronics, microwave power circuits, and optoelectronics have become the foundation of today's electronics technology.  Yet, they emerged from traditionally separated fields and are still largely pursued by specialists trained in different areas.\r\n\r\nHowever, the rapid pace of electronic technology evolution is propelling a merger of the traditionally separated fields.  Evidence is not hard to find around us.  Wireless communication is just one example.  It is time to encourage active cross-fertilization of the different \"species\" in this electronic planet and to call for leadership in bringing together the resources and expertise in these fields.\r\n\r\nThis advanced workshop will be a special forum to gather some of the most creative minds and leading experts from academia, industry, and government agencies, and to review the most recent and exciting breakthroughs in the fields, the underlying physical mechanisms that link these advancements, and to exchange views on future trends and directions, the market pulls and the necessary policy and infrastructure changes.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
