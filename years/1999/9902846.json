 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to unite broadband communications with wireless access thus making possible un-tethered access to a wide range of broadband communications services, such as interactive multimedia communications, high resolution image or large file transfer, and high resolution video teleconferencing. This is done through millimeter wave radio technology and small high-gain antennas. This technology is termed next-generation local multi-point distribution system (NG-LMDS). This is intended to be a cost-effective competitor to all wire-line proposed alternative methods of broadband distribution. Broadband wireless access will afford potentially enormous bandwidth on demand to people. It has the potential to simplify access to interactive business, information and entertainment services by subscribers in fixed locations.\r\n\r\nEstablishment of a local wireless access network which integrates the most advanced millimeter-wave radio technology, coupled with asynchronous transfer mode Wireless Access Point (WAP) will provide homes, schools and businesses with the benefits of choice as regards the expanding list of broadcast and bi-directional multimedia communications services. The research structure involves:\r\n\r\nStatistical analysis of interference in an ATM-LMDS cellular configuration.\r\n\r\nDesign of fixed-cellular ATM-LMDS architectures; with minimum interference by taking advantage of high-gain antennas, frequency-segmentation and polarization interleaving. \r\n\r\nAnalysis of spectral-efficiency in frequency reuse ATM-LMDS cellular architectures. \r\n\r\nExtending the dynamic range of adaptive-coding by combining it with adaptive modulation in ATM-LMDS cellular architecture.\r\n\r\nInvestigating the influence of feedback channel impairments and transmission delay on the performance of adaptive rate systems in preserving an end-to-end Quality-of-Service in ATM-LMDS wireless loop.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of delay and throughput in ATM-LMDS fading channel, using adaptive rate coding techniques. \r\n\r\nAssessing effects of adaptive transmission rate on the interference level of ATM-LMDS cellular architecture.\r\n\r\n",
