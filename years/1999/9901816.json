 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project brings the auditory trainer technology up to the level of state-of-the-art wireless and computer technology.  The program will be to develop and test a miniature, wireless, software/voice controlled Digital Classroom Auditory Transceiver System (DCATS) for use in the hearing impaired classroom.  In addition to its educational benefits, this system will provide expanded communications capability both on campus and in home environments.  Cleveland Medical Devices' digital MicroRadio design will provide full duplex conversation, a long range (up to one mile) mode, and strong future expendability in a \"wearable\" form factor.  Future features include full duplex for more than two persons, microcellular operation throughout a campus, telephone interfacing, and software analysis of student speech.\r\n     Cleveland Medical Devices proffers auditory trainer technology that has sales potential for voice transceivers specifically for the hearing impaired  as well as for electronic interfacing for hearing impaired persons.  In addition, spin-off opportunities for \"wearable\" voice transceiver products have very large potential.\r\n",
