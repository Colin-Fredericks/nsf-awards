 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tIf parties are composed of rational politicians who seek reelection, why do parties sometimes break down?  Recently, many established parties in Latin America have experienced breakdown, which is defined here as losses in elections and the defection of party leaders and activists.  These losses threaten the parties' survival as organizations.  Evidence suggests that current theories cannot explain adequately the magnitude or the variance of the party breakdown.  This proposal briefly analyzes existing explanations and suggests an alternative framework for analyzing party breakdown that focuses on the public demand for policy and other government action, the competitive environment that the parties face, and the choices of the individual leaders and activists inside the party.  Based on this framework, three specific explanations are proposed for party breakdown in Latin America:  clientelism, ideological intransigence, and decentralized authority.  To test  these explanations, the proposal outlines a twelve-month study of five established and four new political parties in Chile and Venezuela.  NSF funding enhances this project by allowing the investigators to carry out interviews more quickly than if they relied on their own resources and by giving them the time and means to analyze their data thoroughly while still in South America.",
