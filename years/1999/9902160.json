 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe choice of a host plant upon which to lay eggs is a critical decision for many plant-eating insects.  Throughout eastern North America, female black swallowtail butterflies (Papilio polyxenes) search for plants on which to lay their eggs. When an egg hatches, the caterpillar is too small to move to another plant and starves to death if the mother lays an egg on the wrong plant. Thus, the female's choice of plants is crucial for offspring survival. Potential hosts for this butterfly include many plant species in the family Apiaceae, including carrot, dill, and parsley. Since these plants look, smell, and taste very different from one another, one wonders how females use visual, olfactory, and gustatory cues to distinguish acceptable plants from surrounding unacceptable ones. Since females consistently choose the same host species generation after generation, the behavioral response to at least one plant cue must be genetically based, or innate. Which plant cues trigger innate responses and which trigger learned responses have not yet been determined. \r\nThis project will examine each of three types of plant cue to which these butterflies respond and determine the relative importance of genetics and learning for butterfly responses to them. This will be the first study of innate responses to host-plant cues for a plant-feeding insect and may have implications for understanding the behavior of other plant-feeding insects, including species of agricultural pests. \r\n",
