 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861211\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project involves the development of novel \"fluid catalysts\" for direct, non-oxidative coupling of methane to alkane (C2 to C8) products. Such low molecular weight (MW) hydrocarbons are basic building blocks for the petrochemical industry. The process to be developed can have substantial advantages over other synthesis routes.  The catalytic process to be developed has two steps, a first step in which methane is chemisorbed and polymerized on a catalyst surface, and a second step in which the surface polymers are removed by a hydrogenation step.\r\n     In Phase I, novel methane coupling catalysts will be synthesized and tested at the bench scale.  Tests will model the steps in a continuous process, and will have as an objective to show catalyst activity and selectivity comparable to that demonstrated by other research groups.  However, the form of the catalysts is to be substantially more economic if adapted to commercial scale processes for alkane production.\r\nThe principal commercial application of the novel catalyst to be developed is lower cost production of lower molecular weight alkanes using methane as a low cost feed stock. The catalyst and process will be amenable to methane conversion processes at both refineries and gas production sites.\r\n\r\n",
