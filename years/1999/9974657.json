 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wingless (Wg) is a member of the Wnt family of conserved secreted\r\ngrowth factors which are essential for the normal growth and\r\ndifferentiation of both invertebrates and vertebrates.  A common signaling\r\npathway has been identified for both Wg and Wnt signaling.  One key\r\ncomponent of the signaling pathway is Zeste White 3 (Zw3), the Drosophila\r\nhomolog of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK-3), a serine threonine protein\r\nkinase, which acts antagonistically to Wg.  It has been suggested that Wg\r\nsignaling is mediated by inactivation of Zw3 kinase.  The long term goal of\r\nthis proposal is to further our understanding of the activity of Zw3 in\r\nvivo, and the mechanism of regulation by Wg signaling.  Dr. Siegfried will take\r\nadvantage of the powerful techniques available in Drosophila, and take a\r\ncombined approach of molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics.\r\n        Her preliminary studies have demonstrated that over-expression of\r\nZw3 leads to a block in the endogenous Wg signaling pathway, suggesting\r\nthat high levels of Zw3 can saturate the normal mechanism of Wg regulation.\r\nWhat this mechanism is remains unclear.  However, the fact that expression\r\nof rat GSK-3b can rescue zw3 mutant embryos indicates that this mechanism\r\nis shared between Zw3 and GSK-3b.  In an effort to identify shared regions\r\nof potential regulation, she has determined the phylogenetic relationship\r\nbetween Zw3, vertebrate GSK-3b and vertebrate GSK-3a, a closely related\r\nprotein to GSK-3b which, nonetheless, is unable to rescue zw3 mutant\r\nembryos.  These analyses have suggested that the amino terminal domain of\r\nZw3 and seven residues within the kinase domain which are conserved between\r\nGSK-3b and Zw3, but differ from GSK-3a, may be important for normal\r\nactivity in vivo.\r\n        She proposea to test this hypothesis by site directed mutagenesis and\r\nexpression of mutant proteins to determine critical residues for catalytic\r\nactivity and regulation.  These mutant forms of Zw3 will be expressed in\r\ntransgenic flies and activity of mutant proteins will be assayed by the\r\nability to rescue zw3 mutant embryos and for retention of Wg regulation.\r\nThe mutant forms of Zw3 will be also tested in cultured imaginal disc cells\r\nwhich are Wg sensitive and recapitulate the modulation of Armadillo seen in\r\nvivo.  She will determine the kinase activity of mutant proteins, test if\r\nthey can modulate Armadillo protein levels in vivo, and determine their\r\nsub-cellular localization.  Finally, she will design genetic screens to\r\nidentify second site suppressors or enhancers of a Zw3 over-expression\r\nphenotype which should identify proteins which interact with Zw3, including\r\nnovel components of Wg signaling.\r\n\r\n",
