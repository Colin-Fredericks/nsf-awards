 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer-based simulations of natural phenomena are particularly effective educational tools, especially when integrated into field and laboratory-based experiences. The investigators propose to build and evaluate educational software that simulates tree and forest growth and the effects of natural and human-created environmental disturbances on forest growth. We hope to further advance inquiry-based science teaching practices throughout Western Massachusetts. An inquiry-based educational philosophy is already deeply embedded into the academic structure, as well as in the faculty's teaching methods. To this institutional foundation we add collaboration with the NSF-funded Five-College PALMS and STEMTEC programs. These programs have built relationships between researchers, teacher education programs, and practicing teachers at local K-12 schools, and will allow us to have significant impact in local undergraduate as well as high school education. An innovative contribution in the area of evaluation will be to combine evaluation methodology and teacher education.\r\n\r\nPre-service and in-service science teachers will carry out some of the classroom-based testing. The student teachers will serve as vectors for introducing both the simulation technology and the inquiry-based teaching methods into existing classrooms. The results of the research, including software, student and teacher support materials, and evaluation results, will be distributed via a dedicated web site. One of the contributions of this work will be in developing an approach to representing simulation formulas that is applicable to educational simulations in any subject area. While most educational simulations are 'black boxes' that do not allow students to inspect or manipulate the underlying formulas, our software will include a Formula Inspector that will allow students to more deeply address four types of inquiry questions: 'what if,' 'relationship,' 'why,' and 'modeling.' DUE themes addressed: teacher preparation, integration of technology with education, faculty development.\r\n\r\n",
