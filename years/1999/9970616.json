 "awd_abstract_narration": "9970616\r\n\r\nThe investigator proposes to continue his work in commutative algebra, studying syzygies of ideals which arise in combinatorial applications.  Syzygies are iterated relations among the generators of ideals, which reveal hidden structure in ideals.  His previous work provides a foundation for interpretting sets of syzygies as objects in combinatorial topology, and provides a link between toric and monomial ideals, two significant classes of ideals arising in combinatorics.  He seeks to extend this foundation for a class of toric ideals which relate to the combinatorial theory of matroids, and to then generalize the new results to a broader class of ideals, while avoiding arbitrary orientation choices by working in a product of projective spaces.  He will also continue his study of computational algebraic geometry and his development of computer algebra tools, seeking to further develop injective methods as a computational tool.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the investigator proposes to strengthen a link between counting methods in combinatorics and in algebra, for the purpose of making the algebraic methods more applicable to combinatorics.  In many combinatorials settings, such as counting colorings of a map, one can count by overcounting the possibilities, counting each possibility at least once, and then iteratively correcting by subtracting each overcount at least once, and so forth. Syzygies play exactly the same role in algebra, correcting for overcounting of dimensions.  The investigator's prior work yields new interpretations of syzygies which arise from combinatorial problems, and he seeks to further develop these interpretations and to apply them to combinatorial problems.\r\n",
