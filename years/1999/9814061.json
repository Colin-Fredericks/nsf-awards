 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shaul Mukamel is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in molecular relaxation and radiative processes.  He will continue his development of theoretical methods for investigating exciton dynamics and vibrational motions in molecular aggregates and their signatures in femtosecond nonlinear spectroscopies.  This research will provide a unified technique for interpreting experimental data from a broad range of time resolved laser experiments including pump-probe dynamics, fluorescence up-conversion, photon echo, transient grating, birefringence, dichroism, time-resolved Raman, and four-wave mixing.  The theoretical approach is based on Liouville-space Green's function techniques.   Mukamel will apply this methodology to light harvesting antennae complexes of photosynthetic bacteria, J-aggregates and semiconductor nanoparticles, hole transfer in polypeptides, photoisomerization in Bacteriorhodopsin, and photon echo spectroscopy of the hydrated electron.\r\n\r\nThe advent of pulsed laser technology combined with the use of non-linear optical techniques has led to a large number of new methods to probe gas phase and condensed phase molecular systems.  Mukamel is developing theoretical techniques that are central to the interpretation of the data obtained from these experiments.  These interpretations lead to many important chemical dynamical insights regarding chemical reactions and the effects of solvation in condensed phase systems.\r\n",
