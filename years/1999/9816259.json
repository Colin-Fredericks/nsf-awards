 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to develop and test a theory of network cohesion that stems from research on power and commitment in exchange networks. This formulation breaks new ground by integrating ideas from two previously distinct research programs, Network Exchange Theory and the Theory of Relational Cohesion. Network Exchange Theory is a formal theory of power in exchange relations that uses information about the network structure to predict power and the distribution of resources in networks. The Theory of Relational Cohesion deals with negotiated exchange in the context of a network, and predicts that structural power produces commitment to exchange partners through an intervening emotional-affective process. The new Theory of Network Cohesion combines the two via a formal mathematical model that predicts when networks of \"self-interested\" persons evolve into \"collectively-oriented\" groups. The theory is consistent with previous work on dyadic commitment, and generates new predictions for larger social exchange networks.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical argument is that certain types of exchange networks generate feelings of global solidarity or cohesion, above and beyond any person-to-person dyadic commitment. Specifically, it hypothesizes that densely connected networks containing a high proportion of equal power relations should produce interactions that elicit feelings of groupness among all network members. Dense networks embody a type of structural \"closeness\" that virtually ensures all members have the potential to exchange resources with one another. Relatively dense social structures have fewer cliques, allow persons to easily interact with most or all others (high reachability), and exhibit less stratification of network positions. The distribution of power also has important consequences for the solidarity individuals experience in social interaction. The Theory of Relational Cohesion and attendant research indicate that equal power relations generate feelings of excitement or pleasure, and these emotions cause the relationship to become a valued object in its own right. Based on these principles, it is predicted that the combined effect of network density and distribution of power should produce \"group-wide\" feelings of solidarity that transcend local exchange ties.\r\n\r\nThe theory will be tested in a fully computerized experimental setting wherein persons negotiate with partners over a pool of profit points that can be redeemed for cash. This is a form of negotiated social exchange where persons in relations must agree on the division of profit or earn nothing at all. The theory predicts that certain network configurations will lead to interactions and perceptions that bind members together and to the group as a whole. The project calls for four experiments, manipulating network density and the distribution of power, to determine how network structures foster (1) emotional attachments to the larger group as a distinct object and (2) behavioral acts of commitment directed at other group members. Two distinct forms of commitment behavior will be studied: a symbolic gesture with little extrinsic value (i.e., the giving of small token gifts) and a non-symbolic form of pecuniary self-restraint (i.e., the division of profit in a dictator game). Four experiments will measure both forms of behavior under a variety of network configurations.\r\n\r\nThis project has broader implications for group solidarity and cohesion. Whether the setting involves corporate agents in commercial enterprise, salary negotiations between professional ball players and team owners, or the buyers and sellers of black-market goods, the structure of network relations largely determines who interacts with whom and the extent to which power is used to promote self-interest. The Theory of Network Cohesion predicts that under favorable network configurations, interactions and exchanges will be distributed across all group members and the distributions of profit will tend toward equality. The result will be that people experience mild everyday positive emotions, develop a sense of common experience and group identity, and refrain from opportunism or malfeasance.\r\n",
