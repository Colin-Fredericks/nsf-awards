 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a mathematical framework based on Renormalization Group (RG) theory that is capable of predicting the geometrical structure of very densely wired and optimized networks without recourse to empirical fitting parameters. The power of the RG technique is that it is not a descriptive theory but rather a general method for constructing theories. It is therefore capable of analyzing a wide range of interconnect analysis problems ranging from wire placement to cross-talk. It succeeds by successively renormalizing wire arrangements, reducing a strongly coupled, multiple-length scale problem to a large number of much simpler single-length scale problems. The research activities being carried out under this grant include: (a) the identification of so-called critical points in the design parameters of processing chips which indicate a transition from easily scaleable designs to unscaleable designs, (b) the development of algorithms to move these critical points to positions which make previously unscaleable designs scaleable, (c) to relate the theory of optimized interconnect geometries to the more general and universal physics of critical point systems which include magnets, boiling water, and percolation.\r\n",
