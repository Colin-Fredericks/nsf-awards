 "awd_abstract_narration": "This fundamental research in mathematical physics and applied mathematics focuses on the challenges presented by the incompressible Navier-Stokes and related equations of fluid dynamics.  The Navier-Stokes equations constitute the basic mathematical model for fluid flow, and are believed to contain turbulent dynamics among their solutions.  Turbulence in fluid mechanics remains one of the outstanding challenges for theoretical physics and applied mathematics with important applications in many fields of science and engineering.  The work is carried out via modern applied and numerical analysis by the principal investigator and a mathematics graduate student doing doctoral dissertation work.\r\nThe project has three specific objectives.  The first is to extend a rigorous technique for deriving theoretical bounds on turbulent flow quantities to new applications for heat transport in Marangoni convection, and more generally to turbulence in fluid systems with imposed stress boundary conditions.  Second, we aim to extend the background field method for applications to unbounded flow domains to derive theoretical limits on turbulent drag coefficients for flows past a compact body.  It remains an open problem, for example, to establish a limit on the drag experienced by a sphere moving at high speed through a viscous fluid which is both mathematically rigorous and physically relevant.  The third objective is to investigate small length scales appearing in turbulent flows by means of a set of dynamical equations derived for an analytic extension of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations.  Mathematical results in this area will produce strict lower bounds on the small length scales associated with high wavenumber exponential decay of the Fourier power spectrum in turbulent velocity fields.\r\n",
