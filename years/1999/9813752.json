 "awd_abstract_narration": "9813752\r\nCarlson\r\nThis award supports education and theoretical research in tribology. Carlson proposes to continue her work focussing on three areas:  (1) derivations of phenomenological friction laws from experimental data and microscopic models, (2) studies of microscopic models of interfaces in which different dissipation mechanisms can be explored, and (3) applications of friction models in seismology and engineering. The first of these continues development of the PI's proposed rate and state friction law for boundary lubrication and extends the study to a broader class of rate models applicable to granular materials, polymers, adsorbed lubricants, foams, emulsions, and rough lubricated interfaces.  The second of these involves the study of many degree of freedom models for interface sliding. Of particular importance are the identification of macroscopic laws from atomistic or continuum models and to better understand the origins of cooperative effects and the importance of fluctuations.  The last area involves applications of friction models in engineering systems and seismology.  A focus of this research is to elucidate how variations in the friction law affect seismological observables, such as propagation speed, rise time, etc. \r\n%%%\r\nThis award supports education and fundamental research on friction and wear, and their microscopic origins. The nature of the research is interdisciplinary and applicable to a wide range of mechanical interfaces under various conditions, including interfaces lubricated by foams and polymers, and the interfaces at geological faults.  In the latter case, computer simulations are used to interpret data from specific earthquake events.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
