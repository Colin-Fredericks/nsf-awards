 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rensselaer's Darrin Fresh Water Institute (DFWI) at Lake George, New York, provides a unique resource for the Adirondack Mountain region.  The mission of DFWI is to advance environmental education and research on the ecology of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, especially in relation to the impacts of human activities on natural resources.  DFWI is actively engaged in teaching at both undergraduate and graduate levels and in many forms of public outreach.  DFWI also provides physical and administrative support both for basic and applied research, ranging from stormwater and groundwater studies, to monitoring and developing management strategies for invasive non-native organisms, to mapping and remediation of polluted sediments, to hydrologic and watershed budgeting, to investigations of plankton community dynamics.  The multidisciplinary nature of the programs supported by DFWI is reflected in the topics of courses taught on site, which include limnology, ecology, environment microbiology, ecological economics, and vertebrate ecology.  With the aid of an award from the NSF Field Stations and Marine Labs Improvement program, DFWI completed the construction of a year-round research and teaching facility in 1995.  This  new lakeside laboratory allows DFWI to support research on a year-round basis, and to bring modern techniques and approaches into all of its research, teaching, and outreach programs.\r\n\r\nDFWI facility does not have the computer resources necessary to integrate computer-based studio-style interactive teaching with the naturally interactive, hands-on, small-class teaching style typical of field station courses.  This project will correct this shortcoming by building a lakeside multiuse computer facility that will provide students, faculty, staff, and visiting researchers at DFWI with access to learning tools such as interactive ecological modeling, a range of basic and more sophisticated statistical data analysis techniques, and the worldwide electronic access that are all essential in science today.  One particular goal of these improvements is to provide access for both teaching and research purposes to geographically oriented data collection and analysis via geographic information systems (GIS) software and portable global positioning system (GPS) units.  These tools are finding increasing applications in ecological and environmental research, and can now be applied on the same desktop computers used for more common statistical data analyses and for computer-based teaching tools.  Another goal of these improvements is to provide computational resources for hydrological modeling both of watersheds and waterbodies.  The linking of GIS tools to sophisticated statistical and hydro-ecological models will improve the examination of complex natural systems, and will provide facilities at DFWI for teachers and researchers to use multidimensional models to aid their understanding of large-scale processes.\r\n",
