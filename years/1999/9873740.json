The objective of their research is the development of tomographic measurements and nondestructive techniques for image reconstruction.  They will develop algorithms for defect detection and analysis and will focus on two algorithmic and modeling approaches for three-dimensional reconstruction from predominately X-ray data.  The project takes advantage of the complementary expertise of the US and French investigators and the different algorithmic and modeling approaches developed by the French investigator.  \r\n\r\nNondestructive testing can be used to identify and inspect defective objects having faults that are not visible from the exterior.  The design of computerized reconstruction algorithms, the principal goal of this project, translates critical information extracted by certain media, into visualizations.  These algorithms will be useful in the inspection of infrastructure, transportation systems, manufacturing materials, and archeological and paleontological objects. \r\n",
