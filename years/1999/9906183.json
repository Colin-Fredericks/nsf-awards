 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will examine the politics regarding contemporary molecular genetics and its implications, through a case study of political controversies over development of policy and practice for breast cancer genetic testing and patenting in the United States and Great Britain. The genetic etiology of breast cancer, announced in the 1990s by scientists both in the United States and Great Britain, has stimulated active debates regarding appropriate testing practices, genetic risk, genetic privacy and discrimination, and the ethics of patenting genetic sequences. This project will investigate the experiences and interactions of a variety of relevant actors throughout contentious political debates over these issues, understanding the simultaneous construction of biomedicine and transformation of political identities, legitimacy, and expertise. The comparative aspects of the study encourages the exploration of national specificity in the development of breast cancer genetics, suggesting the relative influences of political culture and globalization on the trajectory of contentious politics. Research will be conducted through intensive interviewing, participant observation, and document analysis. By exploring the simultaneous construction of biomedicine and the polity, this dissertation research project  will contribute to emerging scholarship in science and technology studies which investigates the \"co-production\" of science and politics. In addition, it will facilitate our understanding of the politics of public participation in biomedical policymaking, exploring the ways in which legitimacy and expertise are achieved in late 20th and 21st centuries. Finally, this project provides a unique opportunity to examine the incorporation of genetic knowledge into contemporary societies by exploring the voices of the participants in these biomedical politics.",
