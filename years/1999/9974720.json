 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is part of an ongoing investigation at Treasure Island, California, to investigate the effect of blast loading on structures.  This particular project is investigating the difference between blast-induced and earthquake-induced liquefaction.  The goal is to learn more about earthquake-induced liquefaction, but since it is so difficult to obtain data during strong earthquake shaking, there continues to be a lot of interest in obtaining data from simulated earthquake conditions, namely via blast-induced liquefaction.  The question always is: how accurate is blast-induced liquefaction in simulating earthquake-induced liquefaction?  This is the objective of this study.\r\n\r\nThe primary seismic method employed is a crosshole-type measurement, but measurements are also made using the spectral analysis of surface waves (SSAW) technique.",
