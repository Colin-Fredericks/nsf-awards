 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nStrichartz\r\n\r\n\tAnalysis on fractals studies the properties of functions defined on \r\nfractals, centering on certain analogs of differential equations.  On a \r\nlimited class of self-similar fractals it is possible to construct \r\noperators that play the role of the Laplacian, one of the central \r\nobjects in traditional analysis on Euclidean spaces and manifolds.  \r\nThis project will attempt to extend the construction of Laplacians to a \r\nbroader class of fractals, and to explore the fundamental properties \r\nof these Laplacians and other differential-type operators.  In addition, \r\nthis project will attempt to broaden the connections between this new \r\narea of research and more traditional areas, including global \r\nanalysis, harmonic analysis, splines and the finite element method, \r\npseudodifferential operators, and special functions.  This project \r\nincludes collaborative work with undergraduate students (REU) on \r\ncomputer experiments to explore examples and generate \r\nconjectures.  It is expected that this experimental work will lead to \r\ndeeper theoretical understanding of the subject. \r\n\r\n\tScientists in diverse areas have realized that many objects in the \r\nreal world can be modeled by fractals.  In order to study physical \r\nprocesses on such fractal objects, it is necessary to develop a \r\nmathematical theory that will give the analog of differential equations \r\non fractals.  Such a theory is in the early stages of development, and \r\nthis project will contribute to that development, bringing to the \r\nproblem ideas and techniques from other areas of mathematics.  It \r\nis expected that this project will develop tools that will be of use to \r\napplied mathematicians and scientists, since part of the project \r\nfocuses on numerical methods and algorithms for solving concrete \r\nproblems.  The contribution of undergraduate students to the project \r\nwill be significant, and in turn will be a positive educational \r\nexperience for the students. \r\n\r\n",
