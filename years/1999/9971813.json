 "awd_abstract_narration": "McLaughlin\r\n9971813\r\n     The investigator and his colleagues study complex nonlinear\r\ndynamics for two extended systems: (i) Nonlinear Dispersive Waves\r\nand (ii) Primary Visual Cortex.  Project (i) concerns the random\r\nbehavior of nonlinear waves -- specifically chaos for\r\nnear-integrable soliton partial differential equations.  For these\r\nequations temporal chaos is now rather well understood; however,\r\nfar less is known about the more severe behavior of\r\nspatial-temporal chaos.  Both its onset, as well as the\r\ndescription of its macroscopic temporal evolution, are studied\r\nthrough a combination of asymptotic averaging and numerical\r\nexperiments.  Project (ii) is to develop a theoretical and\r\ncomputational model of the primary visual cortex (V1).  A point\r\nneuron model of V1 is developed, with a realistic coupling\r\narchitecture between cortical neurons.  The model is constrained,\r\nwhenever possible, by physiological and anatomical measurements.\r\nIt has a multi-layered architecture and focuses upon dynamical\r\nbehavior of the cortical network.\r\n     Nonlinear systems can have solutions that behave randomly,\r\neven though the system itself is strictly deterministic.  When\r\nthese systems describe waves that are extended spatially, this\r\nchaotic behavior is not well understood today.  Such extended\r\nwaves are prevalent throughout nature -- including the turbulent\r\nbehavior of air masses and ocean currents that influence both\r\nweather and climate.  Clearly, the prediction of dynamical\r\nbehavior for such chaotic waves has fundamental importance.  The\r\ninvestigator carries out mathematical studies of fundamental\r\nchaotic behavior for idealized nonlinear wave equations.  The\r\nbrain is an extremely complex extended system whose dynamical\r\nresponse to stimulation is a central problem for modern neural\r\nscience.  He and his colleagues, an interdisciplinary group of\r\nneural scientists and mathematicians at New York University, are\r\ndeveloping a computational model of area V1 of the Primary Visual\r\nCortex of the Macaque monkey, the first cortical region along the\r\nvisual pathway at which cortical processing of visual information\r\nis thought to occur.  Their numerical experiments are designed to\r\nsimulate specific laboratory observations of V1 -- with the\r\nresults of both numerical simulation and laboratory experiments\r\nunder continual comparison.  It is easier to identify possible\r\nmechanisms for cortical processing through numerical experiments\r\nthan in the laboratory experiments.  Such interdisciplinary\r\ncollaborations between experimental biologists and computational\r\napplied mathematicians unveil how the cortex processes visual\r\ninformation, and will lead to a deeper understanding of the\r\nfunctioning of the brain.  The project is supported by the Applied\r\nMathematics program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and\r\nby the Computational Neuroscience program in the Division of\r\nIntegrative Biology and Neuroscience.\r\n",
