 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-term collaboration to integrate research and education will be\r\nformed between the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) and the\r\nLaser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).  This\r\ncollaboration will incorporate four faculty members and approximately\r\nten students from UTB, and staff scientists and engineers from LIGO\r\nlaboratory.  Research activities will focus on three main areas\r\nrelated to gravitational wave data analysis: (i) software development\r\nfor detector characterization, (ii) software development for\r\ngravitational wave detection, and (iii) construction of a distributed\r\nprocessing environment to analyze gravitational wave data.  Students\r\nfrom UTB will spend approximately ten weeks each summer at the LIGO\r\nobservatory in Livingston, LA where they will install and test\r\nsoftware developed at UTB.  Enhancements to education will consist of\r\ntwo new graduate-level courses and four new undergraduate\r\ncourses/modules, which will integrate the research activities into the\r\ncurriculum.\r\n\r\nThe activities listed above are important for a variety of reasons.\r\nThe LIGO interferometers will soon be joined by similar gravitational\r\nwave interferometers and several resonant bar detectors located in the\r\nUS, Europe, Japan, and Australia.  This world-wide network of\r\ngravitational wave detectors will open a new window onto the universe,\r\nallowing physicists to understand better the nature of strong\r\ngravitational fields and astronomers to \"see\" objects and catastrophic\r\nastrophysical events that cannot be studied by more traditional\r\nelectromagnetic-based astronomy.  The commissioning of the LIGO\r\ninterferometers is scheduled for the year 2000, and a two year\r\nscience-data run is planned for the end of 2002.  Thus, it is essential\r\nfor the success of LIGO and the world-wide network of detectors that\r\nsoftware for analyzing the performance of gravitational wave detectors\r\nand for searching for astrophysical sources must be developed and\r\ntested within the next two or three years.  The addition of new courses\r\nat UTB and the opportunity for students to spend time at the LIGO\r\nobservatory should attract more students into science and engineering,\r\nand consequently increase the number of minority students graduating with\r\nscience-related degrees.\r\n",
