It will lead to advances in superconducting and magnetic materials, which have naturally occurring magnetic structure, and in artificially structured mesoscopic materials. The major goal of this project is the development of sensors with sufficient sensitivity to image mesoscopic electronic phenomena by detecting the magnetic fields produced by persistent currents.  Magnetic Force Microscopes (MFMs), Hall probes, and Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) each have particular advantages and disadvantages.    Fabrication, testing, and subsequent experimentation with these sensors will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in materials physics and nanofabrication techniques.  This award will also partially support the development of a microfabrication-based research experience course, which will provide undergraduates with a solid grounding in the scientific principles and practice of microfabrication, and with the opportunity to conceive, design, fabricate, and characterize their own microfabricated device.  This course will be offered as part of a new applied physics minor, intended for undergraduate engineering and science majors, which is being offered by the historically graduate Stanford Applied Physics Department.\r\n%%%\r\nThis project focuses on research in the area of nanofabricated magnetic sensors related to the study of electronic structure on small length scales.  In addition, the project will partially support the development of a new microfabrication-based research course to provide undergraduates with a solid grounding in the scientific principles and practice of microfabrication, and with the opportunity to conceive, design, fabricate, and characterize their own microfabricated device.  This course will be part of a new undergraduate minor in applied physics being introduced by the Stanford Applied Physics Department which has historically been solely a graduate department. The work supported under this proposal will provide training for both graduate and undergraduate students in materials research and nanofabrication techniques at the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility and at the newly constructed Laboratory for Advanced Materials.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
