 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861063\r\n     The agricultural sector accounted for approximately 31 percent of total US methane emissions and is a major source of C02 emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency, state, and local regulators are imposing new restrictions on confinement production facilities because of odors and the emission of greenhouse gases. The Phase I research project will determine the feasibility of collecting greenhouse gas emissions from swine confinement facilities and converting it into a feedstock for  production of biomass in a photobioreactor. Phase II research will involve the development and testing of a prototype \"bioair\" collection, processing, and photobioreactor system. Phase I research will involve collection of \"bioair\" gases from a swine production facility and utilizing micro algae cultures at Argonne National Laboratory for bioprocessing the livestock gases feedstock. In Phase II a photobioreactor will be developed to convert the bioair feedstock into a valuable biomass source for use as a feed protein, biomass product, or other higher value commercial product. \r\n     The bioair collection, processing and photobioreactor systems will be sold beginning in Phase III to livestock confinement operations in the United States and throughout the world. The system will allow producers to address serious environmental, worker safety, and public relations problems while reducing their input costs and producing commercially marketable co-products.\r\n\r\n",
