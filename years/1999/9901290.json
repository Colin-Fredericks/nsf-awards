 "awd_abstract_narration": "9901290\r\nPoirier\r\n\r\nRecent research has shown that microporosity is an important microstructural feature that relates to the mechanical behavior of aluminum casting alloys.  Micropores in aluminum casting alloys can nucleate during solidification with very little supersaturation.  This indicates the existence of pore-nucleating agents in the melt prior to solidification.  Such agents appear to be oxides, either in the form of skins or films that are often observed on fracture surfaces of fatigue specimens.  The research involves novel experiments for introducing oxides into aluminum melts in a systematic manner so that the number density of the oxides can be controlled and measured.  Castings are then made from the melts and the porosity in the castings measured and compared to the number density of the oxides in the melts.  A second objective is to develop a computer simulator to predict the formation of porosity during solidification.  This effort requires innovation in how pressure during solidification relates to the population and size of pores and their locations in castings.  The permeability of a mushy zone in a solidifying alloy is treated with a stochastic permeability.  Such an approach has not been used previously for simulating solidification of dendritic alloys.  The formation of pores during solidification is related to the number density of the oxide skins as determined in the above-described experiments.  As a final step in the program experimental castings will be produced that have the potential for avoiding oxides and oxide-skins in aluminum castings. \r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports interdisciplinary research involving faculty of Materials Science and Engineering and Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Arizona. The solidification simulator will enable casting engineers to predict the population and size of pores and their locations in castings. Avoidance of casting defects eliminates a major culprit in initiating fatigue cracks in aluminum transportation castings.  The desired outcome of the research is a greater acceptance and use of aluminum castings in transportation vehicles where fatigue resistance is important.\r\n***\r\n",
