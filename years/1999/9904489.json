Mohamed Abdelsalam and Robert Stern, Center for Lithospheric Studies, University of Texas, Dallas, Texas and Dr. Abdel-Aziz Hussein, National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences in Cairo, Egypt.  These investigators plan to study the structural and tectonic evolution of the Neoproterozic Allaqi suture in SE Egypt and to explore the nature and mode of gold mineralization along this suture zone.  A combination of detailed field studies and remote-sensing techniques will be used.  Remote sensing analysis will include processing, development and interpretation of three Landsat Thematic Mappers (TM) scenes covering an area of 90,000 km2 and one high-resolution Satellite Probatoire pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) scene covering an area of 2,000 km2 and centered around areas hydrothermal alteration occurs.  The main geological problems associated with the Allaqi suture are the changing structural character (strike-slip vs. thrust fault) along the suture zone, emplacement direction and mechanism(s) of ophiolites, and the spatial and temporal relations between mineralization and formation of various structures within and across the shear zone.  These are significant questions to better constrain the tectonic evolution of the Arabian-Nubian Shield and potentially to obtain critical information on the nature of structural, magmatic, and hydrothermal processes during crustal build-up in the Neoproterozoic.  \r\n\r\nScope: The PIs have a good track record of conducting interdisciplinary geological studies in the Arabian-Nubian Shield and publishing the results of their work in a timely fashion. The PIs have access to the necessary facilities (Remote Sensing Lab at UTD).  The collaboration with the Egyptian colleagues would be quite helpful and would strengthen the international link to develop various remote-sensing techniques in search of mineralized zones along crustal-scale shear zones, particularly in Precambrian environments.  One graduate student from the United States will participate in the fieldwork in Egypt, and one junior Egyptian scientist will participate in the research at UTD.  This is in addition to the three cooperating scientists.  This proposal meets the INT objective of increasing US-foreign collaboration in areas of mutual benefit.\r\n",
