 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines cultural influences on emotion behavior among the Minangkabau of West Sumatra, Indonesia. Two basic questions are addressed: (1) What constitutes a satisfactory description of Minangkabau emotions? (2) How is emotion part of everyday life within this cultural context? Although general family resemblances in emotions exist across cultures, there are few if any precise equivalences. For example, most cultures know emotions that are similar to Western conceptions of anger emotions. However, different cultures put different spins on the basic aspects of emotion behavior, and the anger emotions in English (which include such emotions as 'fury' and 'annoyance') differ from the 'marah' emotions in Indonesian or the 'berang' emotions in Minangkabau. Such differences exist in many details, including (a) cause, (b) how these causes are appraised, (c) self-regulatory rules about showing or not showing anger, and (d) use of facial expressions, felt bodily sensations, and other behavior. In the past decade or more, many researchers (especially in North America and Europe) have made great progress in developing understandings of each of these aspects of emotion. However, this work has tended to produce universal statements through theoretical formulations that have been fairly basic. The present research with Minangkabau is aimed at discovering the culture-specific elements in these aspects of emotion. Several research methodologies will be used, including focus groups, schoolroom observations, and individual interviews. In addition to scholarship on Minangkabau and Indonesian cultures, the research will deepen our understanding of emotions in all cultures, and provide a way of thinking about emotions cross-culturally.\r\n\r\n",
