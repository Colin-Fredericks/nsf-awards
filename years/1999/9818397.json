 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary biology has developed a sophisticated casual theory to explain microevolution (changes within species over relatively short time spans). By contrast, paleontology has traditionally emphasized descriptive studies of macroevolutionary patterns (patterns occurring over millions of years that often involve multiple species). Because of their different foci, these disciplines remained only loosely connected until the 1970s when a gradual rapprochement began. This project examines the growing interconnections between paleontology and evolutionary theory in order to test and refine philosophical accounts of interdisciplinary integration and the unity of science. The central hypothesis to be examined is that even though the neo-Darwinian theory of microevolution is not sufficient to explain all macroevolutionary phenomena, it is both possible and desirable to more fully integrate the paleobiological and microevolutionary perspectives on macroevolution.\r\n\r\nThis professional development fellowship will allow a philosopher of biology to work closely with faculty in the Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago. Close collaboration with active scientists will allow the PI to develop a more refined understanding of complex scientific issues in order to provide a more adequate philosophical analysis. Specifically, the PI will examine four areas where biologists have worked to unify the micro- and macroevolutionary perspectives: adaptive radiation, mass extinction, the evolution of large body size, and speciation rates. This research will (1) increase awareness of this important area of scientific work within science studies disciplines, (2) evaluate the benefits and limits of interdisciplinary integration, (3) critically examine the prospects for non-reductively unifying these disciplines, and (4) help practicing biologists identify both the potential benefits and the obstacles preventing a more integrated theory of macroevolution.\r\n",
