The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Belinda S. Chang with support for twelve months to work at the University of Rome Tor Vergata in Rome, Italy, with Professor Valerio Sbordoni.\r\n\r\nDr. Chang will do natural experiments in molecular evolution to study the molecular basis of vision in extreme environments.  Her aim is to molecularly clone the rhodopsin gene (Rh1) from organisms living in two extreme environments:  1) Extreme cold - by studying springtail insects in continental Antarctica and 2) Complete Darkness -by studying the Catopid beetles in caves of northeastern Italy.  Rhodopsin is a transmembrane receptor that when activated by light, forms the critical first step in vision. Both temperature and light availability dramatically affect this critical role.  Comparisons between these two cases would allow the identification of regions of the rhodopsin molecule and amino acid sites that are important in determining thermal stability.  Dr. Chang will clone rhodopsin genes from three Antarctic Collembola and an Italian cave-dwelling catopid beetle and then reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of these and already cloned insect rhodopsins, upon which rates of substitution among different lineages can be examined and tested.\r\nDr. Sbordoni is one of the leading world experts in studying the biology of organisms that live in these two extreme environments.  He is a renowned speleologist.  His lab has outstanding facilities for molecular biology, including one of the latest Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencers (ABI Prism, model 310).\r\n***\r\n",
