The focus\r\nwill be the linear and nonlinear analysis on complete Kahler\r\nmanifolds under various curvature conditions. The main goal is to\r\nunderstand the spaces of holomorphic functions (and sections of\r\ncertain holomorphic bundles) on complete Kahler manifolds under\r\nvarious curvature assumptions and apply the properties of these\r\nvarious spaces to the study of the geometry and topology of\r\ncomplete Kahler manifolds with various curvature conditions, in\r\nparticular, the uniformization of complete Kahler manifolds with\r\npositive bisectional curvature.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the PI's investigation belongs to fields called\r\ndifferential geometry and global analysis on\r\nmanifolds. Differential geometry is the study of the relationship\r\nbetween the geometry of a space (a manifold in the language of\r\ndifferential geometry) and analytic concepts defined on the\r\nspace. Global analysis is the study of the overall geometric and\r\ntopological properties of a space by piecing together local\r\ninformation. Since the space is usually a curved space, the term\r\n``curvature'' is introduced to measure the deviation from the\r\nEuclidean space, which is flat. Applications of these areas of\r\nmathematics in other sciences include the structure of\r\ncomplicated molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale\r\nstructure of the universe. A Kahler manifold is a complex space\r\nwhich has an extra structure called Kahler structure. The\r\ngeometric and analytic properties of Kahler manifolds are\r\nimportant to various fields of mathematics and physics such as\r\nlow dimensional topology, algebraic geometry and superstring\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
