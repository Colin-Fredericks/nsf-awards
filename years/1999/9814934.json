 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time IP routers that provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees is a fundamental building block for Next-Generation Internet, which promises differentiated service levels that are independent of external\r\nnetwork loads and enforced on a connection-by-connection basis.  Although a large body of theoretical work in the past decade has resulted in >advances of our understanding of the complexity of various real-time packet\r\nscheduling techniques, relatively little research has gone into the implementation aspects of building such routers. This project proposes to study in depth software/hardware implementation techniques for high-performance scalable real-time packet routers. Specifically, we plan to focus on the following three issues: routing-table lookup, real-time packet scheduling, and systems support for and applications of the concept of active networking.  The project directors  are going to carry out the proposed research with an experimental approach by building a software-only parallel real-time IP router called Suez, which is constructed out of a cluster of high-performance commodity PCs connected by a Gigabit/sec system area network. The goal of the Suez project is to evaluate the feasibility and performance behavior of the proposed\r\npacket routing and scheduling implementation techniques in a fully operational prototype, and to demonstrate that with the help of efficient software support, off-the-shelf PC components can be interconnected to build multi-million packets per second scalable real-time packet routers.\r\n",
