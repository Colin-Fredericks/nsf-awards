 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the establishment of an Institute for Educational Technology (IET) dedicated to the development of effective Internet-based distance learning materials.  The project 's activities fall into three categories: 1) the development of a strategy for the design of pedagogically based Internet courses, 2) the establishment of a faculty development and resource institute to sustain the quality and overriding strategy of the project, and 3) the implementation of an outreach program targeting populations that are underrepresented in science and engineering.  For the model courses of pre-calculus mathematics and computer science web-based CourseBooks are in development and testing.  CourseBooks combine \"classroom lectures\", \"chats with the professor\", and an \"ask your classmates\" feature all via streaming video embedded in web pages. To encourage students to pay attention to the virtual lectures, questions are asked by the virtual professor at appropriate times. A collection of web-based hands-on activities that strengthen the student's problem solving skills are also be included. Finally, a hypertext version of the class notes (or textbook) is provided as well. All of the components (video and otherwise) are tightly interwoven with cross-links between appropriate sections.  Formative and summative evaluations are used to refine these course materials.  The materials developed under this project will be disseminated nationally via the website, CD / DVD ROM, and published textbooks. Regional dissemination includes tests at minority high schools.\r\n\r\n",
