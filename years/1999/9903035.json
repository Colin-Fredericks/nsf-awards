 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal requests partial support for a symposium to be held in Spring of 1999 on the topic of Cognition and Instruction.  The results of the symposium would be published as the 30th in the series of Carnegie Cognition Symposium volumes.  The aim of the symposium would be to review progress and highlight major accomplishments during the past 25 years since the first Carnegie Symposium on Cognition and Instruction.\r\n\r\nA dozen of the leading researchers in the field would describe the contribution of their work to that progress.\r\nParticipants will include both seasoned researchers who have been in the field since its inception as well as promising new investigators from a variety of disciples related to cognition and instruction, including cognitive development, instructional psychology, intelligent tutoring, and collaborative learning.  In addition, the speakers and the discussants -- including active researchers and \"gatekeepers\", such as journal editors and funding agency decision makers -- will identify remaining challenges and suggest possible research and development avenues to resolve these issues.  The plan is for a 3 day symposium with expected attendance of between 150 and 200 people.",
