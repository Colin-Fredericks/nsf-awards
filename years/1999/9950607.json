 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal physiology at the University is in need of curricular revision. At present the laboratory component of courses has either fallen away from investigative empiricism to passive observation of demonstration, or is entirely absent. Consequently many students have little idea of experimental design, procedures, or analysis of results; also we have found that critical thinking skills of our senior students are not increased over those of our freshmen. Although, the College and the Department promote undergraduate research, no facilities presently exist for a student to carry out a research project in animal physiology.\r\n\r\nWe propose to adapt 'Workshop Biology', an inquiry-based approach to learning which was developed at the University of Oregon. Problem posing and problem solving enable students to construct meaning from learning experiences. By integrating lecture with laboratory the integration of content (concepts) and process (investigation) is also achieved. Students will use their own bodies as experimental subjects to investigate acid-base, cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, and neuromuscular physiology; invertebrates will be used for invasive procedures. Computerized data recorders will be needed for measurement of physiological parameters and analysis of results.\r\n\r\nThe students impacted by this use of technology to drive curricular reform will be in freshman biology (40), junior/senior level biology (15), secondary teacher education (1 -3), freshman nursing (30) equine science (8), and freshman physical education (30) courses.\r\n\r\nWe expect that this investigative approach to animal physiology will improve conceptual learning and scientific reasoning abilities, expose students to research methods, equipment and opportunities early in their college years, and build technical skills and familiarity with the types of instruments which many of our student use in their later careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
