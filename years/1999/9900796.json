 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9900796\r\nMitchell\r\n\r\nThe Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (OK-LSAMP), comprising eight Partner institutions and 19 Affiliates within the state of Oklahoma, was established to address the critical undersupply of minority students pursing degrees in Science Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (SMET) fields.  Phase I, initiated by eight Partner institutions, features a multilayered student support system to improve the use of shared resources for outreach activities, educational achievement and preparation for advanced study in SMET fields.  In just over 4 years, more than 640 Native American, African-American, Hispanic and Native Pacific Islander undergraduates students were served directly through Freshman Summer Bridge, Scholars, and Research Internship Programs.  The OK-LSAMP is now exceeding project graduation goals from the baseline of 214 in 1994, with 454 degrees earned in 1997 and 410 in 1998.  Nationally, in 1997, the highest numbers of Native American students enrolled and receiving baccalaureate degrees were from Oklahoma Alliance universities.  Additionally, Native Americans were 5.6% of those enrolled in Oklahoma colleges and universities, were 9% of students enrolled in SMET, and receiving 8% of SMET baccalaureate degrees.  As the OK-LSAMP program reaches maturity, this progress should continue into the new millennium.  To maintain the educational continuum and to develop the SMET program further, we propose a Phase II program that emphasizes preparation for graduate education.\r\n\r\nThe overall objectives are:\r\n\r\nto expand by including three new Partner institutions to broaden the pool of available targeted students;\r\n\r\nto expand the Research experience through academic year activities; (The Summer Research Internship experience will be expanded to include more off-campus academic and non-academic research sites.)\r\n\r\nto increase early preparation activities and subsequent application to graduate programs through a series of workshops and orientations to graduate schools and programs;\r\n\r\nto establish Summer Transfer Bridge Program with 2-year Affiliates; and\r\n\r\nto offer a clear and specific discipline related Teacher Preparation component to undergraduates seeking a degree in a SMET discipline.\r\n",
