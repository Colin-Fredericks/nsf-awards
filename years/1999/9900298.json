(joint funding with CISE CNPq and International Program)\r\n\r\nNSF-CNPq Collaborative Research: Multi-Agent Collaborative and Adversarial\r\n      Perception, Planning, Execution, and Learning\r\n\r\nThis is a three-year standard award. This project aims to investigate a concrete spectrum of issues of relevance to the development of teams of complete robot agents in dynamic, real-time, and adversarial environments. The proposed research will investigate and develop agents that are: (1) autonomous - with on-board sensing, planning, and acting,  (2) efficient - capable of achieving specific goals under time and resource constraints through the integration of deliberative and reactive planning, (3) cooperative - capable of collaborating with each other to accomplish tasks that are beyond individual's capabilities, and (4) adaptive - capable of learning from experience by refining their individual and collaborative action selection preferences.This multi-agent robotic research will be carried within the context of robotic soccer. The robotic soccer domain introduces many specific research topics, including: (i) complete integration of perception, action, and cognition in a team of multiple robotic agents; (ii) definition of a set of robust reactive planning behaviors for individual agents (each agent should be equipped with skills that enable it to effectively perform individual and collaborative actions); (iii) reliable, real-time and active visual perception, including tracking of multiple moving objects and prediction of object movement; (iv) multi-agent strategic reasoning. The proposed work will build upon the research experience of the\r\nU.S. research group on planning and learning and on the Brazilian research group on real-time perception. \r\n",
