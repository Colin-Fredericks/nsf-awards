 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) offers potential benefits in many\r\nareas, including biological and ecological research, resource\r\nmanagement, and other facets of human interactions with the natural\r\nworld. Realizing these benefits involves linked steps of documentation,\r\nanalysis, application, and integration with other forms of knowledge.\r\nWhile previous research by P.I. Huntington on TEK of beluga whales has\r\nexplored the semi-directive interview as a practical method for\r\ndocumenting TEK, further research is needed to (a) explore the potential\r\nfor local documentation of TEK, (b) characterize the subsequent steps by\r\nwhich TEK can be used, and (c) develop models for doing both.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project addresses three related questions:\r\nCan the semi-directive interview methodology be successfully used or\r\nadapted for use in locally-managed efforts to document TEK? \r\nHow is TEK used in the cooperative management setting of the Alaska\r\nBeluga Whale Committee? \r\nCan the results of (1) and (2) be generalized to other cases in Alaska,\r\nthe Arctic, or the world?\r\n\r\nTo address these questions, the project has four objectives:\r\nLocal Documentation of TEK: Conduct locally-managed documentation\r\nprojects, using the semi-directive interview method, on TEK of beluga\r\nwhales. \r\nApplication of TEK: Examine the structure, management, and conduct of\r\nthe ABWC and its meetings to assess the role that TEK plays. \r\nAnalysis: Compare the results of (1) and (2) with existing information\r\non other cooperative management bodies in Alaska, and other attempts to\r\nuse TEK both in Alaska and elsewhere. \r\nWorkshop: Hold a workshop in the final year of the project, to summarize\r\nand synthesize what has been learned, to assess how these results have\r\ncontributed to understanding of TEK and its use, and to identify future\r\nresearch needs.\r\n\r\nThis research will develop models for documenting TEK and for using TEK\r\nto improve research on and management of natural resources. These models\r\nwill identify significant factors influencing the documentation and use\r\nof TEK, including those that may influence the applicability of our\r\nmodels in other settings.\r\n\r\n",
