 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCensus Research Data Centers (RDC) provide secure access to highly confidential longitudinal micro-data from Census surveys of business establishments and firms and from demographic surveys of households and individuals.  This project covers part of the start up and operating costs of a new RDC at Duke University to provide data access to the intellectual community in the \"Research Triangle.\"   Duke University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and North Carolina State University constitute the intellectual and geographic vertices of the Research Triangle.   This Triangle is home to two major medical schools, historically black Central Carolina University, Research Triangle Institute, major research arms of US Government Agencies (such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Forrest Service), and a number of additional institutions of higher learning.  Over one hundred researchers drawn from all of these nonprofit institutions and over a dozen disciplines support this project.  The majority of those hundred plus researchers have on going projects whose scientific merit would increase substantially if the research could take advantage of the unique opportunities offered by access to particular sets of confidential Census Data. Projects on heath, the environment, crime and education are among those proposed.\r\n\r\nIndividually and collectively the researchers who have lent their name to this proposal are well-funded and have long-experience with all the responsibilities, extra measures, secure environment, and vigilance required to maintain the integrity of confidential data. This project contains a financial plan to make the Triangle RDC self-funded over a period of about six years. It also has a governance structure with a Review Board  to ensure an open and fair review and selection process as well as excellent facilities for researchers at the Triangle RDC. The proposed Review Board, Faculty Research Coordinator, and an Executive Director work closely with the Census Bureau to ensure fair and objective access to the resources of a Triangle RDC while maintaining the \"culture of confidentiality\" essential to the success of the RDC program.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
