 "awd_abstract_narration": "Financial support is requested from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to convene a workshop for researchers in the area of low-temperature geochemistry, and the goal of this workshop will be to develop, prioritize, and recommend research directions and opportunities in the area of low temperature geochemistry to be funded by NSF in the coming decade. The directions and priorities derived from this workshop will be reported to the Board of Earth Science Resources (BESR), National Resource Council of the National Academy of Sciences.  As detailed in Letter to Colleagues from NSF (NSF Geosciences Beyond 2000:  A Window on the First Decade), the maintenance of a habitable Earth in context to increasing demand for Earth'' resources (air, water, soil, metals and non-metals) is a pressing societal concern.  The improved understanding of the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere and interconnection of the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere (the Earth System) by geochemical cycles are first-order scientific problems.  Research addressing the interconnections within the Earth System and Man's impact on Earth may also require a fresh approach(es) in terms of new research directions to be pursued compared to the present ongoing research directions.  The anticipated outcomes from this workshop will be a report documenting research directions and priorities submitted to BESR and, in addition to research directions and priorities, this report will also comment on the need for the development (or on the development itself) of useful and appropriate geochemically based topics to be included in undergraduate and graduate geoscience curricula.",
