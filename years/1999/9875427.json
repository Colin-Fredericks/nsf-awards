 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875427\r\nCrawford\r\nThis proposal focuses on novel microstructures formed by molecular and mesoscopic self-assembly that possess high degrees of order, well defined symmetry, and strong anisotropic optical and dielectric properties.  These unique attributes, in conjunction with their versatile fabrication and processing, robust thermal and mechanical stability, and responsiveness to external fields, will result in interesting physical phenomena and exciting new applications.  Various reactive mesogenic compounds are being made available by EM Industries and the NSF ALCOM Center at Kent State University to create and study microstructures exhibiting novel electrical, optical, and mechanical properties of potential high technological interest.  The educational goal of this project is to establish a well integrated education and research program on soft condensed matter materials at Brown University.  The educational program will target K-12 outreach through interactive hands-on modules, undergraduate laboratories and curriculum development, and research opportunities for undergraduates.\r\n%%%\r\nInterest in reactive mesogens is being expanded because of their important role in emerging liquid crystal based technologies and a richness in physical phenomena that makes these materials highly relevant to other applications areas.  For example,  diverse set of ordered microstructures on the submicrometer scale that includes solid rods and spheres, hollow tubes, 'yarn balls', and torroids are of high technological interest and may be extremely useful for optical devices and as a new means of controlled drug release.\r\n***\r\n",
