Through a correspondence  between Beltrami fields and the Reeb dynamics of contact  structures, one can import techniques from contact topology  and pseudoholomorphic curve theory to answer questions of  existence of solutions and of forced recurrence. In addition,  knot-theoretic techniques shed light on the global properties  of the Euler equations on Riemannian manifolds. Goals of this project include the resolution of the Weinstein Conjecture on solid tori (which would imply that steady force-free fields in a tokamak have closed field lines), the spectrum of knot types which can/must appear as closed flowlines in steady Euler flows, and the implications of the tight/overtwisted  dichotomy in the hydrodynamical context with respect to  hydrodynamic instability and energy minimization.   \r\n\r\nOne of the enduring challenges in science is the comprehension  and taming of fluid behavior: from tornadoes to ocean currents,  we live in a world of complicated fluid dynamics.  All of these phenomena have mathematical manifestations ---  projections onto a simplified abstract setting whose  analysis yields clues to the workings of the physical world. This project will focus on the equations governing ``perfect'' fluids: models appropriate for certain non-viscous  fluids and plasmas alike. Emerging techniques from global  geometry and topology provide tools for attacking problems heretofore beyond the reach of analysis. Surprisingly, such  seemingly unrelated questions as ``How do strings tie up  into different knots'' and ``What does geometry in four  dimensions look like'' are closely tied to questions of  recurrence and stability in steady fluid flows. \r\n",
