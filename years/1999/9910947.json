Use of the spectrometer will be coordinated with scheduling and use of existing lower field instruments so that its ultra high field and enhanced sensitivity and resolution can be dedicated to the most challenging research problems in characterization of structure/function and dynamics of important biological macromolecules.  Six basic scientists in biochemistry and the NMR Center at Duke along with three investigators from the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State University comprise the initial major users.  The spectrometer will also be available for use by others who have a demonstrated need for this state-of-the-art capability to address projects of unusual interest and importance.  Research in the following areas will be significantly advanced:\r\n\r\n\tDNA regulation and repair proteins and assemblies\r\n\tRNA-protein catalytic complexes\r\n\tEnzymes important in the synthesis of membrane lipids\r\n\tMembrane associated lipids\r\n\tModified RNAs\r\n\tCell signaling enzymes and peptide binding transporter proteins\r\n\tProtein conformational dynamics\r\n\tMethodology for structural studies of large proteins and protein complexes\r\n\r\n\tThe proposed ultrahigh field spectrometer represents a significant addition to the instrumentation capabilities at Duke and will serve as a unique resource in the region.  It will be located in and function as part of the Duke Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry Center, a shared instrument facility serving the geographic area of the Carolinas.  With the acquisition of this instrument, the Duke facility will substantially enhance research efforts in currently strong biochemical programs at this institution, in the Research Triangle, and in the region.",
