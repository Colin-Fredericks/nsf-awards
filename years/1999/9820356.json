 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow 15 undergraduates to participate in the SURE program at Emory University. This program meets for 10 weeks (June-August) and offers hands-on research opportunities. The SURE program receives funds from various sources; participants will be working in all areas of biology as well as psychology, anthropology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics.  Students will participate in research in the areas of developmental biology, cell biology and molecular modeling, under the direct supervision of Emory researchers.  Participants will be recruited from Atlanta-area institutions and small college's nation-wide, with an emphasis in offering research opportunities to women and minorities.\r\n\r\nAwardees will work with a mentor in a research area selected by the student. The student will spend ten weeks as a part of the research team and will participate in laboratory activities such as seminars and lab meetings. The student will also attend SURE activities that relate to science careers and ethics in science. The program has a strong ethics component, which includes weekly meetings and presentations by guest ethicists. Participants will complete research projects they will then present to the Emory community during a poster session at the end of the program. Students will also be invited to write a popular science piece on their research. Awards will be made for the best posters and articles during the closing banquet. Participants will be eligible for travel aid should they present their summer research at a scientific meeting.\r\n",
