In particular we\r\nplan to investigate the local and global well-posedness of the\r\ninitial value problem for the completely integrable\r\nCamassa-Holm equation.\r\nAnd finally, in the third part we plan to show that the exponential map of\r\nan appropriate metric on the group of volume--preserving diffeomorphisms of a\r\ncompact riemannian manifold  is a nonlinear Fredholm map of\r\nindex zero. This would be significant because, as is well known,\r\ngeodesics of this metric correspond to solutions of the Euler\r\nequations of hydrodynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\nPartial differential equations is a many-faceted subject.\r\nOur understanding of the fundamental processes of the natural world\r\nis based to a large extent on partial differential equations.\r\nFor example, the equations considered in the first part of our\r\nproposal arise in the diffusion of chemicals, in the spread of heat,\r\nand in many other physical processes influenced by diffusion.\r\nMoreover diffusion processes are closely connected to\r\nrandom (Brownian) motions. The synthesis of the theory of these\r\ndiffusion partial differential equations and probability\r\n provides the theoretical framework for studying problems\r\nwhere diffusion and randomness are present. An example outside\r\nmathematics and physics is the field of Finance, where powerful techniques from\r\nstochastic analysis have been brought to bear on almost all aspects of\r\nmathematical finance: pricing of financial derivative products such\r\nas options and bonds, hedging, interest rates and so on.\r\nThe equations in the second and third parts arise from problems in\r\nhydrodynamics. They are mathematical models describing\r\nfluid flow. The study of these equations will contribute\r\nin our understanding of wave formation, the structure of their\r\nsingularities, and\r\ntheir long time behavior. It may also contribute in the very\r\nbig problem of understanding turbulence.\r\nAt the same time the theory for studying these partial differential\r\nequations problems forms a vast subject  that interacts with many other\r\nbranches\r\nof mathematics, such as complex analysis, differential geometry, harmonic\r\nanalysis, probability, and mathematical physics.\r\n\r\n",
