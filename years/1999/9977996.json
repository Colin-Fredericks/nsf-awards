 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general goal of scientific plant breeding has been development of modern crop varieties that have high yield in high-input, low stress environments, and are geographically widely adapted. This strategy has been successful in replacing farmers' traditional varieties and increasing yields to keep up with growing human consumption. However, plant breeding today is addressing major problems in making agriculture more sustainable. Modern farms are subjected to increasing stresses; inputs are being reduced in environments that have been high-yielding; many of the world's poorer farmers in high-stress environments have not and cannot adopt modern varieties and face increasingly inadequate yields; and the need to conserve the base of genetic diversity on which all plant breeding depends is threatened by the loss of farmers' varieties.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, major differences among plant breeders in the way these problems are understood, and thus the solutions sought, including the role of plant genome research and biotechnology, and the currently popular attempt to bring together scientific and farmer plant breeding (known as participatory plant breeding). A major objective of this research is to understand the causes for these differences by documenting and analyzing the interacting roles of values, knowledge and data in the understanding of key components in plant breeding theory: the relationship between yield and yield stability, and the role of genetic diversity in local adaptation. Methods for collecting qualitative and quantitative data will include an analysis of plant breeding literature, in-depth interviews with plant breeders at international breeding programs and affiliated national programs and at participatory plant breeding programs, and a world-wide internet/mail survey of breeders.\r\n\r\nThe two major broad approaches within plant breeding to the problems of sustainability will be analyzed in terms of differences in understanding of these key components. The conventional approach sees refinements of modern plant breeding as it has been widely practiced as adequate for increasing both yield and stability - maintaining crop genetic diversity through time in the form of modern varieties replacing one another, while conserving farmers' varieties ex situ in gene banks, and developing more widely adapted varieties by ignoring or avoiding the problems caused by the trade-offs between yields and stability. The alternative approach sees the potential for a negative relationship between yield and stability, influenced by genetic and environmental variances - it advocates increasing the genetic diversity within and between crop varieties, and by developing varieties specifically adapted to high stress environments.\r\n\r\nThe project will set the current debate about problems of sustainability in plant breeding, including the relationship between scientists and farmers, and the role of biotechnology, in cultural, social, historical and geographic perspective. It will help participants to discriminate values and empirical data in the development and testing of theory, and contribute to constructive discussion and policy making within plant breeding and society that will help achieve more sustainable agriculture.\r\n\r\n",
