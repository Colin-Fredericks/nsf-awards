 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes the preparation and study of amphiphilic linear-dendritic hybrid copolymers.  Key features of these include a dendritic core with adjustable hydrophobic properties coupled with hydrophilic copolymers at the surface.  Structure-function studies will be carried out to maximize the surfactant and emulsifying properties of these molecules.  Emulsification properties will include the ability to stabilize oil emulsions in water giving an ability to solubilize significant amounts biologically active but water insoluble drugs.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Toby M. Chapman of the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Chapman seeks to construct molecular capsules that will carry water insoluble substances into aqueous solutions.  Study of the variation in these molecules properties as their structures are changed will allow one to finely tune these structures in order to permit the carriage of drug molecules for site-directed release at the optimal location.",
