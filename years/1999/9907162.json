 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project addresses a critical problem for agricultural development in Portugal and elsewhere in the world where farmers and scientists are attempting to collaborate in the co-management and development of natural resources. Currently there is growing concern for developing sustainable agricultural systems that build on local knowledge and skill. This has motivated much interest in collaborative plant breeding between scientists and farmers. However, there are critical areas of plant breeding in which the relative comparability of farmer and scientific knowledge remains unclear. The researcher  will conduct an ethnography of plant breeding knowledge specifically focusing on the \"procedural\" or \"working knowledge\" which is common to both farmers and scientists. The goal is to understand how farmers and scientists construct their respective knowledge about crop biology and farm ecology in relation to daily work routines and technical practices, the physical processes involved in acquiring experience, and the social and material contexts in which theoretical, empirical and intuitive knowledge is produced. The researcher will examine these processes using a combination of visual and other descriptive data for samples of farmers and scientists, including a case study of collaboration between a scientist and a farmer-breeder in Northwest Portugal.\r\n\r\n",
