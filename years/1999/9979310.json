 "awd_abstract_narration": "The currently envisaged third-generation wireless communication networks will provide clear improvements over the current systems, but will fall short of the goal of seamless communication for a large variety of services anywhere and anytime. Because the goal presents tremendous scientific and technological challenges spanning several disciplines, a multi-disciplinary, integrative research approach involving several researchers makes eminent sense. As such, our research will be conducted by four researchers whose backgrounds are in electromagnetics, signal processing and coding, and networking. The research will advance the state of the art in each of these \"layers,\" but will also explore how each of the layers might benefit the other layers.\r\n\r\nWork at the RF Layer will involve the design of low-profile, low-power broadband antennas, with single and multiple antenna structures.  Also studied for the benefit of the Signaling Layer are statistical and temporal models of the propagation environment. Research at the Signaling Layer will include the design of serial and parallel concatenations will be studied for both frequency selective and flat fading channels. Serial and parallel space-time concatenated codes will be designed also for systems with transmit diversity. Both textbook channel models as well as models developed in the RF Layer work will be adopted. At the Network Layer, work will involve performance analysis of quality of service metrics, on-line bandwidth allocation mechanisms, and adaptive error control under quality of service guarantees. Operation at this layer will be aided by data provided by the Signaling Layer. The research is collaborative, including the four University of Arizona researchers and members from industry.\r\n",
