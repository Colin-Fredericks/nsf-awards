 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nNorth American hummingbirds are specialized to feed on the energy-rich diet \r\nprovided by flower nectar. These diminutive birds gain access to flowers \r\nthrough their unique form of locomotion: hovering flight. Hummingbirds are \r\ntypically found in all North American habitats with abundant flowers,\r\nincluding very high altitude meadows such as those that occur in the Colorado Rocky \r\nMountains. The rufous and broad-tailed hummingbirds compete for floral \r\nresources in the Rockies across a altitudinal range spanning 2500 meters. \r\nThe two species weigh about the same but the wings of the rufous \r\nhummingbird are on average only 83% of the size of the broad-tailed \r\nhummingbird's wings. Because air is thinner in the mountains, species with \r\nlarge wings can more easily generate enough lift to fly at high altitudes. \r\nHowever, species with larger wings are at a disadvantage at low altitudes \r\nbecause they are less agile than species with small wings. Small-winged \r\nspecies outcompete large-winged hummingbirds at low altitudes, so there is \r\na trade-off between competitive ability and altitudinal range. The PIs predict \r\nthat rufous hummingbirds will outcompete broad-tailed hummingbirds at low \r\nelevations and thus dominate the best resources. Conversely, the rufous \r\nwill be less competitive at high elevations due to high costs of flight and \r\nthus relegated to the less preferred resources. The PIs also predict that the \r\nincreased costs of flight and related competitive behavior will be \r\ninfluenced by the density of the air rather than by oxygen availability.\r\n\r\n",
