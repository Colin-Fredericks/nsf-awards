 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the development of meteorological and remote sensing products in support of the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) experiment. TOPSE is a multi-investigator, aircraft-based program designed to study the tropospheric spring ozone maximum over high latitude North America and the Arctic.  Characterizing changes in the dynamically modulated background ozone concentration in the rnid-troposphere will be an important component in the success of the TOPSE experiment. Where and how this ozone is advected will also be traced. Satellite remote-sensing work, in combination with detailed meteorological analyses, including 3-dimensional visualizations of the atmosphere during flights, the production of detailed cross sections, and calculations of 3-dimensional back trajectories, form the basis of the proposed effort. This support work will be carried out to maximize the ability to interpret aircraft, ozonesonde, and surface-based chemical observations, which are the focus of TOPSE. Real-time meteorological products will be produced and made available on web pages in standard image formats and as animated loops with interpretive text. Archives of imagery and meteorological model fields will be developed for the duration of the field campaign and post-intensive analyses will be undertaken in collaboration with TOPSE chemists and modelers to interpret all chemical observations in the appropriate meteorological context.",
