 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is focused on the synthesis and characterization of hollow tubular nano-structures formed by hydrogen bonding interactions between amide and carbonyl groups of macrocyclic monomers, each of which contains two urea units linked to form a donut shaped building block.   The Y linker units in (-YHNCONH-)2 contain aromatic rings to keep the cyclic monomers planar, and can be chosen to provide a variety of tube dimensions and hydrophobicities.  Based on known molecular structures, the repeat distance between donuts is expected to be 4.61 Angstroms.    The tubes, which are expected to self-assemble in solution, will be characterized by proton and carbon NMR, STM, and x-ray diffraction.  \r\n\r\nWith this POWRE award the Chemistry Division supports the work of Linda S. Shimizu in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, SC.   The proposed research will explore the synthesis and characterization of hollow organic tubes of controlled molecular dimensions which are expected to find uses as ion and small molecule transport devices, sensors and catalysts.\r\n\r\n",
