The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide support for a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Jill E. Hemmati to work with Dr. Harold S. Shapiro at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.\r\nDuring her tenure in Sweden, Dr. Hemmati will join the research group, Holomorphic Partial Differential Equations and Potential Theory.  She will participate in the group's seminar and work on problems concerning the occurrence and propagation of singularities of solutions to certain types of partial differential equations in Cn.  In addition, she will attend seminars of the Mittag-Leffler Institute, whose program for the year is being directed by two members of the Royal Institute's research group.\r\nShapiro's research group has established itself as one at the forefront in this field.  For the year that Dr. Hemmati will be in Sweden, the Mittag-Leffler Institute will be studying the topic \"Potential Theory and Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations,\" making Stockholm the center of the world for this period of time for those working in that field.\r\n***\r\n",
