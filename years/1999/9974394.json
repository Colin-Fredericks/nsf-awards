 "awd_abstract_narration": "How does the nervous system control muscles whose function changes with their mechanical context? To answer this question, Dr. Chiel is studying muscles in an animal, the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, whose biomechanics and neural control are both tractable to experimental\r\nanalysis. To test the hypothesis that the function of the muscles I1/ I3 during feeding are dependent on their mechanical context, he will study the changing position of I1/ I3 relative to other muscles in the feeding apparatus in intact, feeding animals using MRI, as well as constructing a detailed kinematic model. Using neurophysiological techniques, he will also\r\ndetermine whether the nervous system of the animal exploits the context-dependent properties of the I1/I3 muscles to generate different movements during biting as opposed to swallowing.\r\nThe proposed research is likely to suggest principles that will clarify the control of context-dependent muscles in higher vertebrates as well as in invertebrates. These studies will lead to the development of novel MRI imaging techniques that may be applied to many other freely\r\nmoving biological structures. Finally, these studies suggest a richer view of motor control, in which motor patterns are not purely driven by activity of the nervous system, but are actively constructed from the dynamics of the body as well as the dynamics of the nervous system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
