The language faculty is \r\nthought to interact with other faculties of mind, including those responsible \r\nfor articulation/perception and intentionality/conceptualization. That\r\ninteraction determines crucial properties of linguistic representations. In \r\nturn, the linguistic system is seen as computational, and optimal in the \r\nderivation of interface representations.    \r\n\r\nThe conjecture opens an obvious research program. To begin with, it forces\r\nus to rethink many notions that sustained the Principles and Parameters\r\nframework. For instance, we are not allowed to arbitrarily postulate levels\r\nof representations or give mere notational conventions a deep ontological\r\nstatus. More profoundly, if the linguistic system is computational, and\r\noptimally so, derivational dynamics, crucially sensitive to complexity, \r\nshould be responsible for a variety of effects which were previously taken \r\nto follow from static primitive conditions.\r\n\r\nWhether the strong minimalist thesis is tenable will depend on how well it\r\nexplains the wealth of data that previous models accounted for, and how \r\nnaturally it fits within the general enterprise of studying the human mind. \r\nThe present research tries to undertake these goals within the Linguistics\r\nDepartment at the University of Maryland, as well as its Cognitive Science\r\nand Neuroscience program.\r\n\r\n",
