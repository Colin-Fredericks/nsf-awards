Kennedy\r\n\r\nAbstract: This research will focus on how periodic structures arise in problems such as crystallization and sphere packing. One approach to understanding how the lattice structure of crystals comes about is to assume that the quantum mechanics produces an effective classical interaction between molecules. Then one studies the classical problem of how to arrange the molecules to minimize this classical energy. Even this classical problem is quite hard, containing the sphere packing problem as a special case. This research will use ideas from statistical mechanics for frustrated systems to prove the optimal configuration for some of these classical problems. A new, simpler proof of the sphere packing problem in three dimensions may be possible by these methods. The role of quantum mechanics in crystal formation has been investigated in the Falicov-Kimball model. Another goal of this research is to understand when this model has a periodic ground state and when it does not. The Falicov-Kimball model is defined on a lattice, but in nature crystals form in space which has no a priori lattice structure. A continuum Falicov-Kimball type model will be investigated. In this model the ions may occupy any site in space rather than just the sites in some lattice, and then the electrons hop between the ions. The goal of introducing and studying this model is to have a quantum  mechanical model that (hopefully) exhibits periodic ground states. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research will focus on how periodic structures like crystals arise. One of the most famous of these problems is the sphere packing problem. Given a large number of spheres of the same size, what is the best way to arrange them so that they occupy the smallest volume. For example, is the way one finds cannonballs stacked at a Civil War battlefield optimal in this regard? Although this problem is hundreds of years old and quite simple to state, it was only solved in the past year. The classical crystal problem is similar. One is given a bunch of atoms and a force law between them. The problem is to find the arrangement which minimizes the total energy of the atoms. The sphere packing problem has important applications to coding theory, and the crystal problem is at the heart of understanding how the crystalline structures that one observes in nature arise. These problems may also be thought of as optimization problems in a large number of variables. This research will develop techniques for establishing the solutions of such optimization problems. The problems are all difficult because they are frustrated -- the best arrangment for a small number of atoms or spheres is not the same as their best arrangment when they are part of a larger group. Techniques developed in statistical mechanics to study such frustrated systems will be adapted to these problems. Surprisingly, it appears that in all these problems the best arrangement is a relatively simple periodic one, even though one allows all possible arrangements, however complicated.
