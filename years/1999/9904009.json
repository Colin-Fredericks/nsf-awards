Technical \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this study are to improve and validate\r\ntransferred-NOESY (Tr-NOESY) NMR methods to determine the 3D structures\r\nand mobilities of peptides bound to large proteins and to determine\r\nprotein surface structures, using antibody imprints for cases  where the\r\nproteins of interest are available in small amounts or cannot be purified\r\nfor structural studies.  The Tr-NOESY approach appears to be a rather\r\ngeneral method for studying the structures of protein-bound ligands if the\r\ncomplexes are not excessively strong. However,  the level of accuracy of\r\nthe structures obtainable from Tr-NOESY is not clear.  Peptide-protein\r\ncomplexes, whose structures are known (biotin-mimetic peptides bound to\r\nstreptavidin), and protein surfaces that are known from x-ray diffraction\r\n(actin surface and peptide epitopes bound to anti-actin antibodies), are\r\nused as test beds to assess Tr-NOESY methods.  Improvements will\r\ninclude: (1) Increasing the accuracy of protein-bound peptide structures\r\nby removing interferences from protein-peptide cross relaxation and\r\nincreasing the number of distance constraints with improved resolution,\r\nusing (uniform biosynthetic) 13C and 15N labeling of peptides and\r\nmagnetization exchange network edited transferred-NOESY (MENE-Tr-NOESY).\r\n(2) Assessing local motion in the bound peptides qualitatively by\r\nmeasurement of  transferred-NOESY as a function of the NMR frequency.  (3)\r\nObtaining more accurate distance constraints, corrected for differences in\r\nlocal motion of the bound peptides, using heteronuclear relaxation data.\r\n(4) Employing 3D Tr-NOESY/Tr-NOESY and magnetization exchange network\r\nedited MENE-Tr-NOESY/MENE-Tr-NOESY to obtain more numerous and accurate\r\nconstraints on protein-bound structures.  These methods are expected to have the\r\ncapability to provide structures as accurately as high quality x-ray\r\ndiffraction analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Non-technical \r\n\r\n\tBiological signaling and specific adhesion are crucial for\r\nregulation of cells and organisms and for guiding proper growth and\r\ndevelopment of multicellular organisms.  Such mechanisms are carried out\r\nby coupling between proteins in webs of protein-protein interactions, that\r\nprovide amplification and control points.  Revealing the structures of the\r\ninteracting proteins can tremendously enhance understanding of biological\r\nmechanisms.  However, most of the interacting proteins have not been\r\ncrystallized for structure determination by x-ray diffraction and are too\r\nlarge for effective structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance\r\n(NMR).  Protein-protein interactions that are responsible for biological\r\ncontrol mechanisms are reversible and typically occur using a small\r\nfraction of the protein surfaces.  Peptides which bind to one of the\r\nintact proteins and block the protein-protein interactions of interest are\r\nselected.  The conformation of protein-bound peptides can be studied by\r\nthe transferred-NOESY (Tr-NOESY) NMR method, if the bioactive peptide is\r\nin relatively fast exchange with the bounding site.  The bound peptide\r\nconformation reflects features of the structure of the interface between\r\nthe proteins of interest.  The Tr-NOESY approach appears to be a rather\r\ngeneral method for studying the structures of interacting protein\r\ninterfaces,  however,  the level of accuracy of the structures obtainable\r\nfrom Tr-NOESY is uncertain.  Therefore, the objectives of this study\r\nare to test systems with known structures to improve and validate\r\nTr-NOESY NMR methods to determine the 3D structures and mobilities of\r\npeptides bound to proteins and to determine protein surface structures\r\nusing monoclonal antibody epitope imprints of the protein surface, for\r\ncases where the proteins of interest are available in small amounts or\r\ncannot be purified for structural studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry\r\nMontana State University\r\nBozeman, MT 59717\r\nPhone/Voice-mail: 406-994-4041\r\nFax: 406-994-5407\r\nE-mail: dratz@chemistry.montana.edu\r\n\r\n",
