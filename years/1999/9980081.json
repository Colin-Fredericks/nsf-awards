 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will design and evaluate the salient features of an electronic knowledge\r\nnetwork, the Internet Learning Forum (ILF), to support a virtual community of pre-service and in-service\r\nmathematics and science teachers, allowing them to share and improve pedagogical practices. The ILF\r\ndesign centers around the vision of a community in which teachers can virtually visit each other's classrooms\r\nto observe and discuss approaches to teaching mathematics and science topics and to share artifacts. The ILF\r\nis meant to support a distributed group of teachers in making the tacit knowledge involved in their teaching\r\nexplicit so that it can be shared with others and, in turn, to aid teachers in using that explicit knowledge a tacit part of their practice.\r\n\r\nThe research goal of this project is to understand the principles for fostering, sustaining, and scaling\r\ncommunities of practice in which the value to participants of sharing their practice and entering in the\r\ndialogue outweighs the \"costs\" of participation (e.g., time, technology access; the concerns of letting others\r\nview one's teaching). While the effective use of technology (the ILF) in supporting a community of practice is\r\na focus of this research, it is clear that technological environments are only one component of an overall\r\ncommunity strategy. Thus, the research looks at the variety of variables that impact the dynamics of the\r\nsocial networks through which teachers seek to improve and share their pedagogical practices. The intent of\r\nthis research will not be to produce abstract measures or scores, but to build a rich story of the historical\r\ndevelopment of knowledge, resource use, practices, and community. The research issues converge at the\r\nintersection of pedagogy, technology, social informatics, and learning theory and have important implications\r\nfor each. An interdisciplinary approach, reflecting this intersection, will characterize the research carried out to address each of the following categories of issues.\r\n(1) How can networking and electronic technologies be used to represent and facilitate the sharing and\r\nevolution of teaching practices?\r\n(2) What are the taken-as-shared meanings that emerge in the ILF communities and how do those\r\nmeanings evolve and diffuse into classroom practices?\r\n(3) How do the ILF members structure themselves into communities and how do we promote boundary\r\ncrossing?\r\n",
