 "awd_abstract_narration": "For more than a decade, a popular slogan among environmentalists has been \"Think Globally, Act Locally.\"  The potential viability of this advice has been assessed in geographic research recently through economic and political analyses of the character and impact of local actions as they become manifest at a range of other geographic scales.  This doctoral dissertation research project will assess local community efforts to reduce global environmental change through participation in the Climate Change Prevention campaign, an program through which local governments promote local initiative to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.  This project will consist of a set of parallel case studies in Seattle, Minneapolis, and Tucson.  In addition to analyses of local political, economic, and environmental conditions within each community, in-depth interviews will be conducted with local environmental, commercial, and government leaders.  The theoretical value of this project will be evident in its contributions toward a deeper understanding of how locally oriented, urban-based political movements can address global-scale problems.  It also will explore whether commitments by cities to lower greenhouse-gas emissions represent a breakthrough in the political economy of emissions abatement through new coalitions of environmentalists, commercial interests, and city government officials that have formed to address the demands of economic development and environmental protection.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\n",
