Industry, a community college and four-year universities have partnered and worked together to develop a model curriculum in biomanufacturing focusing on eight modules designed after the departments of a manufacturing facility. This project will utilize the expertise of this consortium and the recently developed curriculum to accomplish the following five goals. 1) Students will be trained in biomanufacturing technologies using the recently developed curriculum which focuses on workplace skills with an option for a Certificate of Achievement or an A.S. degree in Biotechnology. Strategies to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in biotechnology will be addressed. 2) The pedagogical approach to such training, and the second goal of this project, is to set up an instructional manufacturing laboratory which mimics the industrial environment. Using this manufacturing training facility, scientists from industry will be instructors for the modules,  guaranteeing that the technical training of students directly matches industry needs. 3) The dearth of instructional materials for training in the manufacturing component of the biotechnology industry will be addressed. A training manual based on the manufacturing modules will be developed and disseminated nationwide. 4) The fourth goal of this project is to provide a prototype program in biomanufacturing to educational institutions engaging in curriculum development. Adaptation of the biomanufacturing curriculum will be facilitated by sponsoring workshops and providing resources for faculty \r\nundertaking curriculum development in biotechnology. 5) The final goal of this project will focus on articulation with secondary schools and four-year universities to delineate a career path in biotechnology and ensure academic preparedness of students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
