Planning activities will include a demonstration of the use of a fiber optic network for professional development and a three-day meeting devoted to planning for curricula implementation, professional development and teacher support for all possible school districts.  The meeting will involve teachers, administrators, parents, and community members from the prospective districts.  Before the meeting takes place, districts that have not yet used any of the reform-based curricula will be asked to pilot test at least one such program.  Following the summer planning meeting, the project staff, working with representatives from the interested school districts, will complete the design of a comprehensive reform initiative.",
