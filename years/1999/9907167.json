 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Michael Moseley, MS Donna Nash will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Her archaeological research will focus on the region surrounding the site of Cerro Baul which is located in the Osmore drainage in Southern Peru. During the period from ca. 500 - 1000 AD two states, termed \"Wari\" and \"Tiwanaku\" arose in the Southern Andes and this situation provides a rare opportunity to study the interactions between early simple state level societies. The Osmore drainage appears to mark a boundary between the two and archaeological remains of both are found in this region. While it is often possible to assign sites to one state or the other based on ceramic remains, in other cases such determinations are more difficult because distinctively decorated sherds are lacking. MS Nash plans to approach the problem through an analysis of household organization. Based on work at large high status sites a distinctive Wari pattern which combines domestic and ritual/administrative activities within single structures has been observed. Although it has been postulated to be the case, it is not certain whether this same pattern also exists in the more numerous lower status dwellings. In prior work MS Nash and her collaborators have located a number of small Wari structures and with NSF support she will excavate ten of them. From the distribution of ceramics, lithics and other remains recovered she will determine both the nature and placement of activities. Because some sites will likely contain little habitation debris MS Nash will collect soil samples and determine chemical signatures which are activity related.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons. It will provide insight into the political and social organization of an early state society. It will also develop a spatial signature which will help to define the Wari presence in other regions of Peru. Finally it will assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
