 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for 20 students from U.S. colleges and universities to travel to the International Electronics Manufacturing Technology Symposium, which will be held in Austin, Texas, in October 1999.  The 3-day conference is attended by approximately 200 academics and engineering professionals, and is a forum for discussing new work in the area of semiconductor and packaging processes and products.  Specific topics in past years have included Flip Chip and Ball Grid Array packaging, board level assembly, interconnect developments, reliability and test, environmentally conscious manufacturing, semiconductor processing developments, manufacturing process and product improvement, simulation and modeling, and emerging technologies in electronics manufacturing.  The availability of travel grants will be announced through the conference advance literature, and by university professors who are on the conference committee.  Travel grants will be awarded to students based on their subject area of study, their seniority and the distance of travel to the conference.   The success of the program will be tracked through the attendance statistics collected by the conference organizers, and evaluated during the following year.  \r\n     The goal of the project is to expose more students to current, real-world issues in the field of electronics manufacturing.  Students will have an opportunity to discover topics that interest them, to compare their own work with that being presented at a technical conference, and to network with professionals and academics from other institutions.  The availability of grants is also expected to increase the number of student presentations in future years.  \r\n",
