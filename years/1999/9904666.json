In the\r\ncell, structured RNAs are complexed with proteins or require transient\r\ninteractions with proteins to function efficiently.  Such interactions may\r\nserve to enhance the formation or stability of the correctly folded RNA.\r\n\"Self-splicing\" group I and group II introns are highly structured\r\ncatalytic molecules that require proteins to function efficiently in vivo.\r\nBecause proteins that facilitate intron function can be identified\r\ngenetically and then studied in vitro, these provide convenient models for\r\nprobing the role of proteins in RNA catalyzed reactions and RNA folding.\r\nTwo factors that facilitate the splicing of group I introns in fungal\r\nmitochondria have been examined in great detail.  However, the study of\r\ngroup II splicing factors has lagged behind.  This project concerns two\r\nnuclear genes in maize that are required in vivo  for the splicing of\r\nspecific chloroplast group II introns.  These genes provide unique tools\r\nfor addressing the roles of proteins in facilitating group II intron\r\nsplicing.  The crs1 gene is required specifically for the splicing of the\r\natpF intron; the crs2  gene is required specifically for the splicing of\r\nnine of the ten subgroup IIB introns in the chloroplast.  The current goal\r\nof this project is to define the role played by each protein in the\r\nsplicing process.  The crs1 and crs2 genes were recently cloned by\r\ntransposon tagging.  CRS1 is a novel,  hydrophilic protein.  CRS2 is\r\nrelated to peptidyl-tRNA hydrolases, which function to recycle\r\npeptidyl-tRNAs that are released as abortive translation products.  In\r\nvitro and \"in E. coli \"  RNA binding and splicing assays will now be used\r\nto distinguish between several models for the roles of these proteins in\r\nthe splicing process.  Only a handful of proteins have been shown to\r\nenhance the function of catalytic RNAs in vitro  or in vivo.  It is too\r\nsoon to know how large the repertoire of mechanisms will be for such\r\ninteractions.  Therefore, the results of these experiments are likely to\r\nlead to fundamental insights into the RNA folding problem and the role of\r\nproteins in RNA catalyzed reactions.  The results will also elucidate the\r\nnature of the regulatory interactions between the nuclear and chloroplast\r\ngenome in a higher plant.\r\n\r\nLay summary:\r\n\tThe chemical reactions that occur inside cells are catalyzed by\r\nmolecules called enzymes that facilitate the breaking and forming of\r\nchemical bonds under physiological conditions.  Most enzymes are composed\r\nof protein but some are composed of RNA, which is similar to DNA, the\r\ncarrier of genetic information.  Regardless of its chemical makeup, the\r\nfolding of the enzyme into its correct three dimensional shape is critical\r\nfor its function.  Mechanisms by which proteins fold have been studied for\r\nmany years.  One fundamental concept to arise from this work is that most\r\nproteins cannot fold spontaneously into their correct shape, but rather\r\nrequire help from other protein molecules, dubbed \"chaperones\".  Much less\r\nis known about how catalytic RNA molecules assume their correct structure.\r\nThis project concerns two proteins, CRS1 and CRS2, that are required for\r\nthe function of certain catalytic RNA molecules.  The goal of this project\r\nis to come to an understanding of the role these proteins play in\r\nfacilitating the RNA-catalyzed reactions.  In particular, this project\r\nexplores how these proteins modulate the folding or stability of the\r\ncatalytic RNA molecules.  Only a handful of proteins have been shown to\r\nenhance the function of catalytic RNAs.  Therefore, the results of these\r\nexperiments are likely to lead to fundamental insights into the RNA folding\r\n problem and the role of proteins in RNA catalyzed reactions.\r\n\r\n",
