The traditional approach, based on compatibility conditions, provides only partial results about solvability and regularity of the solutions of such equations and often excludes equations appearing in applications.  The investigator's goal is to establish solvability and regularity results for a wide class of linear and quasi-linear parabolic equations without using compatibility conditions.  To control the solution near the boundary of the region, special Sobolev-type spaces with weights are introduced.  These spaces can also be of independent interest in the classical theory of deterministic elliptic and parabolic equations.\r\n\r\n\tMany natural phenomena are modeled by equations with randomness.  The random, or stochastic, component in the equation accounts for the uncertainties in the model.  Successful analysis of the real life models is impossible without a rigorous mathematical theory of these stochastic equations.  The aim of the proposed research is a comprehensive study of a major class of such equations using various probabilistic and analytical tools.  Some of these tools have been developed by the investigator and his colleagues and successfully used to study the equation of optimal nonlinear filtering, the main equation used in target tracking and target recognition.  The results of the proposed research could be used to develop better navigation and air traffic control systems.\r\n\r\n",
