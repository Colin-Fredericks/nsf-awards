 "awd_abstract_narration": "he Technology Connection links residents of remote villages on Alaska's Arctic Slope with a two-year Associate of Applied Sciences program in information technology (IT) using a mobile computer lab and other distance delivery strategies.  \r\n\r\nProject Activities:   With support from five partner institutions with established IT curricula, courses worth 30 credits at the 200-level are being tailored to meet the needs of local employers, to address Alaska Native pedagogical issues, and to provide the best mix of distance-delivery teaching strategies. Prior to implementation in the region's seven remote villages during year two, courses are being pilot tested on campus. Both a campus-based computer lab and mobile computer lab are being equipped to meet the needs of second-year students.\r\n\r\nOrganizational Structures, Major Participants:  The applicant, Ilisagvik College, is a public, nonprofit, two-year, postsecondary school located in Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost city on the continent. Local public agencies and private businesses have partnered with Ilisagvik to provide classrooms in the villages and hands-on training opportunities. Five academic partners have pledged to share their IT curricula and expertise: Dine College, Maui Community College, Santa Fe Community College, the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, and Nunavut Arctic College. Third- party evaluation will be conducted by staff from the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, with support from Dr. Robert Lorence, President of the Northwest Indian College. Project groups established include an Advisory Panel, Instructional Design Team, and Evaluation Committee. Schedule for Activities The project will span 26 months. Phase 1 is devoted primarily to curriculum development. Phase 2 focuses on pilot testing and dissemination.\r\n\r\nExpected Outcomes: At least one resident from each of the area's seven villages and 10 Barrow residents will complete the AAS degree and will be hired into IT positions in the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
