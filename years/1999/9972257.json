 "awd_abstract_narration": "9972257\r\nLaver\r\n     Steel and Laver proved from a very large cardinal, a theorem about\r\na tower of finite left-distributive ( a(bc) = (ab)(ac) ) algebras.\r\nLaver is studying a family of other finite problems about l.d. algebras\r\nand the braid groups, using large cardinal axioms.  He proved a\r\npartial solution to the strong Halpern-Lauchli problem on binary\r\ntrees, under the assumption of a measurable cardinal, and is working\r\non solving the full problem.  In all the above problems it is not\r\nknown whether a large cardinal is needed.  The project also involves\r\nstudying a very large cardinal axiom of Woodin that behaves like the\r\naxiom of determinacy on higher cardinality versions of the real line.\r\nThis axiom is being studied for its own interest and for the\r\npossibility of variants of it shedding some light on the continuum\r\nhypothesis.  The CH is known to be immune to standard large cardinal\r\naxioms, but not necessarily to strong variants.\r\n     Almost all theorems in mathematics can be proved from a simple\r\nset of basic principles, the Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZFC) axioms for sets.\r\nBut, as first discovered by Goedel im the 1930's, there are some\r\nstatements that can neither be proved nor disproved from ZFC.\r\nHowever, at least for some of these ``undecidable'' statements there\r\nis hope of their resolution.  Namely, they might be proved when one\r\naugments ZFC by ``large cardinal'' axioms, axioms beyond the strength\r\nof ZFC, which assert the existence of very large infinite numbers.\r\nThe undecidable statements are in some cases about finite mathematics.\r\nThe project involves studying some large cardinal axioms and their\r\npotential to solve some well studied open questions in classical math.\r\nSince some of these problems are about the finite world, they cannot\r\nbe ruled out as sources of concrete applications; if this happens, an\r\narea of high philosophical interest will also have a striking\r\npractical use.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
