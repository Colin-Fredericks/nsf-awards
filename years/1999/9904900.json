This project leverages the information from these prior studies by extending the genetic analysis of cell division to a third, distantly related yeast species, Kluyveromyces lactis. Temperature-sensitive K. lactis mutants with general defects in cell growth will be isolated after mutagenesis.  These mutants will be screened via phase microscopy to identify those with defects in the cell cycle at 36oC.  The precise cell-cycle stage that is blocked in each mutant will then be evaluated by a combination of flow cytometry and DAPI-staining of chromosomal DNA.  Because regulation of mitosis differs sharply in S. pombe and S. cerevisiae and mutants isolated in previous genetic screens for mitotic regulators have only partially overlapped, K. lactis mutants may help understand the evolution of these differences.  Once mutants are identified, classified, and sorted into complementation groups, the corresponding genes will be cloned by complementation of the Ts- growth defect using an existing K. lactis genomic DNA library.  \r\nThe project has the potential to contribute to our understanding of cell division in at least five different ways.  First, this study should identify new genes involved in cell cycle control.  Second, the phenotypes of K. lactis mutants may vary in informative ways from those of the corresponding S. pombe or S. cerevisiae mutants.  Third, comparison of homologous K. lactis, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe cell cycle genes should help reveal critical features of genes required for this process.  Fourth, functional differences between K. lactis and S. cerevisiae homologues can be exploited to identify interacting factors.  Fifth, as roles for the same regulator can vary from organism to organism, often for reasons that are as yet unclear, analysis of a second budding yeast should shed light on the evolution of cell cycle regulatory mechanisms and the relationship between these mechanisms and the lifestyle of the organism. The project will also provide numerous opportunities for undergraduate students to conduct independent research.  Such research experience fosters improved scientific writing and oral presentation skills, increased technical abilities in genetics and molecular biology, and an in-depth understanding of a central field within cell biology.\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n",
