 "awd_abstract_narration": "Outward expansion of metropolitan areas continues to be one of the most significant forms of land-use and land-cover change across the Earth's surface.  Within the United States, suburban expansion is estimated to result in the conversion of more than 20 square km daily of farmland or open space into urban uses each day.  Monitoring growth and change along the metropolitan periphery is of critical concern both to those who study metropolitan dynamics and those who must manage resources and provide services in these rapidly changing environments.  This doctoral dissertation research project will examine the processes resulting in land-use and land-cover change from 1973 to the present along the outskirts of the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area through the integration of information from satellite images taken at different times and a dynamic spatial model functioning on a geographic information system.  Satellite-image processing, dynamic model development and calibration, and interactive data visualization will be used to assess the spatial and temporal characteristics of suburban land-use and land-cover change.  The evolution of scattered and clustered urban forms will be evaluated in relation to demographic and socioeconomic changes.  This project will enhance conceptual understandings of land-use and land-cover change mechanisms across different biophysical and socioeconomic domains, and it will add insights regarding the applicability of new forms of data integration and modeling of change.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
