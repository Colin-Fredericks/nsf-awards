The Rustbelt RNA Meeting (RRM) is the only major midwestern regional meeting of RNA researchers.  Last year the RRM was attended by principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students from Ohio State University, Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve University, the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Michigan, Indiana University and Purdue University.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the RRM is to provide an inexpensive, high caliber interdisciplinary regional meeting for RNA researchers in the Midwest with an emphasis on participation by undergraduate,  graduate, and postdoctoral trainees.  The meeting is open to investigators who are interested in the many aspects of RNA.  The meeting format is designed to foster the interaction of trainees at the participating institutions with each other and with the principal investigators.  This award will be used to help defray the expenses incurred by the trainees attending.\r\n\r\n",
