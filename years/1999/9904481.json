The proposed research seeks to augment NSF-funded work being done on electron density modification algorithms for macromolecular X-ray crystallography.  The collaboration capitalizes on the complementary expertise of the two groups: biological x-ray crystallography at Purdue University and image processing for remote sensing at the University of Canterbury.  Both groups will benefit from the collaboration through the opportunity to learn ideas and techniques used in one discipline, and to apply them in the other.  \r\n\r\nBiological x-ray crystallography and imaging of the Earth's surface are unrelated disciplines.  However, the common thread of image reconstruction and the potential advances in improved image reconstruction algorithms for both x-ray crystallography and environmental remote sensing suggest the collaboration has the potential to provide significant added value. New and improved image reconstruction algorithms will be developed for a variety of problems in biological x-ray crystallography and environmental remote sensing.  The methods of generalized projections and Bayesian inversion will be applied to image reconstruction problems in protein crystallography, fiber diffraction, visible and infrared imaging, and synthetic aperture radar.  These problems all involve the measurement of radiation (x-rays, visible or infrared light, microwaves) diffracted or reflected from a target (a protein crystal, the Earth's surface) and reconstruction of some useful characteristics of the target (protein structure, forest cover, land use) from the measurements; and therefore all have a common theoretical underpinning.\r\n",
