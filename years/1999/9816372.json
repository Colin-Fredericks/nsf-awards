 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports research on metal-mediated oxidation reactions by Dr. James M. Mayer of the Chemistry Department, University of Washington.  When nucleophiles, either from other sites in the complex or from other molecules, react with electrophilic oxo, nitrido, or imido ligands, the metal is formally reduced and the nucleophile is oxidized.  In these cases, the site of oxidation is the multiple bond between the metal and the ligand.  The goal of this research is to determine how the ligand electrophilicity can be tuned by changes at the metal center.  Oxidations of carbanions, boranes and alkenes will be studied and the reaction mechanisms determined.  New oxidants will be prepared, including osmium (VI)- and osmium (VIII)-oxo complexes.\r\n\r\nSelective oxidation of organic compounds by transition metals is a critical step in the production of many commodity chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, and is gaining importance in waste treatment.  Understanding key reaction steps is needed to improve present technology.  This research is aimed at elucidating the chemistry of one class of such metal-mediated oxidation reactions.  Students at all levels will be involved in the research and will learn many different instrumental methods and practical laboratory skills.",
