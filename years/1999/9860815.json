 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860815\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project provides a dramatically improved method to synthesize nanoparticle materials using an advanced plasma reactor concept. Nanophase \"super material\" applications are developing at a rapid rate, however, the nanoparticles required for these materials are expensive to manufacture. Consequently, there is a strong need for more economical methods to synthesize nanoparticles. The Phase I project objectives encompass demonstrating feasibility of the novel highly- reactive, well-mixed reactor, to synthesize a spectrum of nanoparticle oxides suitable for a broad-range of commercial applications. The process includes improved synthesis paths and enhanced kinetics to those currently utilized. The research involves the development and operation of a novel reactor to synthesize several commercially important nanoparticle oxide materials. The detailed experimental plan consists of a\r\nseries of parametric tests that will be used to develop a fundamental understanding of the configuration and operating conditions for the reactor that result in the economical production of commercial grade nanoparticle oxides. The project features a highly-qualified team, including an established manufacturer of nanophase materials, who sustains a strong and expanding market for products that will benefit from the proposed technology. As well as an internationally known, and well respected, expert researcher in the field of nanomaterials.\r\n     The market for nanoparticle oxides spans the full spectrum of needs from consumer, medical, electronic, energy, environmental, chemistry, aerospace, defense and heavy industry. Existing commercial applications include catalysts, coatings, elastic ceramics, pigments, abrasives, cosmetics, electronic devices, magnetics, structural ceramics, and is growing.\r\n",
