Finally, a small portion of the funds (about 10%)\r\nwill enable the students to have permanent access to certain important\r\nreference books.  Knight and her students are working on various aspects of\r\ncomputable structure theory.  One student, Charles McCoy, has several results\r\nconnecting definability with complexity.  He is now trying to characterize\r\nin a mathematical way the linear orderings and Boolean algebras with the\r\nfeature that between computable copies, there is always some isomorphism\r\nat level two in the arithmetic hierarchy.  Another student, Andrew Arana,\r\nis beginning work on models of arithmetic and enumerations.  Knight herself\r\nwill concentrate on problems involving existence of computable copies of\r\nstructures.  In particular, she hopes to extend the partial results of\r\nKhisamiev on reduced Abelian p-groups with computable copies.  She is\r\ninterested in a question of Shore, on what statement could serve as a\r\ncomputable non-structure theorem.  Knight has a side interest in systems\r\ntheory. \r\n     The area of computable structure, a new and arguably more suggestive\r\nterm for what has long been known as recursion theory, has its roots in the\r\ndiscovery more than half a century ago of sets of integers for which no\r\nalgorithm exists to decide if a particular integer is a member.  Moreover,\r\nanother old result (from the 1950's) established that there are incomparable\r\nsets of this type, i.e., two sets such that neither permits one to construct\r\nthe other from it in a mechanical way.  As a practical matter, one cares\r\nabout the speed and efficiency of algorithms and not their mere existence.\r\nNevertheless, understanding the inherent limits of algorithmic possibility\r\nis an important philosophical accomplishment and triumph of the human\r\nintellect, in a way the ultimate in self-knowledge.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
