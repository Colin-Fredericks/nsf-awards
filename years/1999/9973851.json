 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Barnbaum   AST 9973851\r\n\r\nThere has been research in the last two years toward the development of adaptive filter technology for radio telescope receivers. Radio frequency interference (RFI) is the radio equivalent of light pollution, which has become a serious problem in radio astronomy.  A prototype adaptive receiver has been constructed and tested. The Florida Institute of Technology will donate a 3-meter radio telescope to Valdosta State University.  The Valdosta State University (VSU) is a public university of 10,000 students. This donated instrument will be a great asset for training students, doubling as a teaching tool, and a platform for astronomical research. This on-site radio telescope at Valdosta State University will be used to continue testing the latest design of adaptive receivers.  There will be close collaboration with faculty in physics at VSU on the project.  Undergraduate students majoring in physics, astronomy and engineering will be involved in the project.  Students will have access to the telescope for carrying out research projects.  A new course on radio astronomy will be developed as an addition to the current undergraduate physics and astronomy curriculum.   The contents of this new course curriculum, which is related to the reaching of radio astronomy, will be presented as a model for teaching radio astronomy.   Information on the course will be disseminated at professional scientific and engineering meetings.\r\n\r\nThis award is supported by funds from the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
