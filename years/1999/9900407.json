 "awd_abstract_narration": "High Frequency Methods for Solutions to Structural-Acoustic Systems with Significant Damping\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop new analysis tools for solving structural dynamics and acoustics problems that are subjected to high frequency broadband excitations, have high modal density, and are not lightly damped.  Such systems are typical of those actually encountered in transportation and flight vehicles.  Currently, these systems are poorly understood and can only be solved accurately using methods requiring extensive computation.  The project contains theoretical, computational, and experimental work.  Two parallel efforts will be undertaken: one using boundary elements formulated from time-averaged energy/intensity variables, and the other extending asymptotic modal analysis to cases where the modes are not uncoupled.  In addition to the development of a simple, efficient approach to solving high modal density systems with significant amounts of damping, the work will focus on understanding the mechanisms involved and gaining insights into the behavior of these high frequency systems.  \r\n\r\n",
