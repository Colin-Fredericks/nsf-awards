 "awd_abstract_narration": "9971123\r\nSarma\r\n\r\nThe project uses high frequency sound (ultrasonic) waves to probe the electronic properties of highly correlated electron systems in the presence of the high magnetic fields supplied by the two sites of the NSF National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), which are located in Tallahassee, Florida and Los Alamos, New Mexico. The selected metals belong to two scientifically important families: 1) the high transition temperature (high Tc) superconductors and 2) the heavy fermion intermetallic compounds.  The heavy fermion metals selected  (UPt3, UPd2Al3, UBe13, and URu2Si2) are thought to have an unconventional superconducting ground state.  Ultrasonic waves, as a probe, complement other thermodynamic probes such as the specific heat, magnetization, and field-dependent dimensional changes (dilatometry), etc. Via their frequency dependence, ultrasonic studies also yield dynamical information (e.g., that associated with internal \"vibrations\" of the superconducting order parameter or relaxational behavior near a phase transition or on approaching and entering a highly correlated ground state as the temperature is lowered).  Of special interest will be the compound Sr2RuO4, which has recently attracted attention as a time reversal breaking superconductor (and hence belonging to a specific class of unconventional superconductors). The proposed work involves studies of and searches for special magnetic behavior in other highly-correlated electron systems, with ultimately up to the highest (non destructive) fields available at the Los Alamos site.  This project offers students and postdoctoral research associates an excellent opportunity for training in cryogenics, ultrasonics and with magnetic fields. \r\n%%%\r\nThis research deals with fundamental aspects of strongly correlated electron systems that may show unconventional superconductivity as one of the ground states.  These systems will be probed with high magnetic fields and ultrasonic waves, and the study will lead to a better theoretical understanding of these systems.  This research will provide students with a broad training in areas of cryogenics, ultrasonics and magnetic fields.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
