 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861522\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore a novel fabrication method for a nonconsumable titanium boride (TiB2) anode used in the electrolysis of aluminum.  The conventional production of one ton of aluminum requires about 65-70 gigajoules of energy and about one-half ton of carbon (graphite) anode in the conventional Hall-Heroult process.   A nonconsumable anode made of TiB2 can reduce energy consumption and eliminate the replacement of carbon anodes as practiced in industry today.  TiB2 is an excellent electrical conductor with high corrosion resistance against metallic aluminum and molten cryolite.  In addition, the use of nonconsumable anodes eliminates toxic gas emissions and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  Unfortunately, TiB2 requires a long sintering time at high temperatures due to its low self-diffusion. Exaggerated grain growth creates internal defects during hot pressing or pressure-less sintering that lead to microcracking.  To counter these difficulties, Phase I will develop a reactive consolidation approach called Plasma Pressure Compaction (P2C).  Synthesis and densification of TiB2 will be achieved in the P2C process within a 15-minutes cycle time by using novel field-activating mechanisms.  Reactively consolidated TiB2 is expected to have high density, small grain size with uniform microstructure, and consistent mechanical properties.\r\n     Synthesis and consolidation of TiB2 by P2C in a single step is anticipated to be applied in fabrication of TiB2 anodes for use in electrolysis of aluminum in the primary metals industry.\r\n\r\n",
