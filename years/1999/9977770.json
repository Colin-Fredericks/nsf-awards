This instrumentation with comprise a next-generation data acquisition system consisting of high-performance hardware and software to read data from, and to provide control of, large numbers of high-granularity detector elements.  The data acquisition system will be applicable to a wide range of high energy physics experiments. Specifically, it may be used for the ATLAS experiment currently being built for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.\r\nApplication to the ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) would enable particle physics research at the highest accessible mass scales, offering the opportunity to search for the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and other new phenomena at the high energy frontier.  It will also provide training in the techniques of high energy physics research, specifically in the areas of high-speed electronics, real-time computing, data acquisition systems, and semiconductor detectors.  The instrumentation development will provide research training for personnel at all levels: faculty, research staff, postdoctoral fellows, and both graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
