Ruckle, Science Department/Mathematics Unit, American University in Cairo, for collaboration with Dr. Kensaku Kikuta, Department of Management Science, Kobe University of Commerce, Japan.  The collaborators will be engaged in research on the following three topics: (1) Accumulation Games, (2) Dynamics of Price Competition and Response Automata, and (3) Dynamics of Coalition Formation.  The first topic concerns two person zero sum games while the other two topics concern non-zero sum n-person games in which a coalitional structure is either not possible or not yet developed.  The method of dealing with all three of these topics will be to build a mathematical foundation that will support computer calculations and simulations and then to develop such calculations.  Drs. Ruckle and Kikuta have collaborated on these topics during a four year period and have obtained substantial results, but many interesting aspects remain to be investigated.  Solution of these problems will be of mutual benefit to U.S. and Japanese mathematicians.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
