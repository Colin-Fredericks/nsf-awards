The first is to develop a more general and flexible form of the Ahlfors theory of covering surfaces, one that applies to variable domains. This will be done with particular emphasis on applications to complex dynamics and shared-value problems. The idea of the Ahlfors theory is to find a modified form of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula for a map which is not a proper covering map onto its image, using the length of the relative boundary. Unfortunately, the conclusions of this theory as presently formulated are only valid for fixed base domains. Hinkkanen plans to consider domains that are variable in a suitable sense, incorporating assumptions that arise from specific applications. The project's second objective deals with solutions to the Painleve differential equations. The aim is to create new methods to establish, in a proper setting, the single-valuedness of such solutions and to investigate their growth.\r\n\r\nComplex analysis, which is the general area of mathematics related to this proposal, provides technical and conceptual foundations for several fields of applications of mathematics, including many in physics and engineering. Specific examples include electrical engineering, and the two-dimensional study of the motion of fluids and gases (to which many three-dimensional problems reduce, due to symmetries). Complex dynamics contains, as a very special case, the study of the dynamical behavior modeled by quadratic polynomials, which both directly and via approximation surface as  fundamental building blocks in the investigation of numerous dynamical systems in physics, biology, and economics. The specific work involved in this project is expected to explain how the possible ways of arranging the geometric shapes of regions can have a significant impact on the behavior of certain complex dynamical systems. In addition, this research addresses global existence and growth properties of solutions to a well-known class of differential equations, the Painleve equations, which have applications in a wide number of areas, differential geometry and mathematical physics prominent among them. Particularly notable among such connections is the recent discovery of the usefulness of Painleve equations in string theory, a branch of physics that seeks to explain the structure of space and matter at a more fundamental level than present-day quantum physics.\r\n",
