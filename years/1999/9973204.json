 "awd_abstract_narration": "Duan\r\n9973204\r\n     The investigator studies complex geophysical flow phenomena\r\nmodeled by finite or infinite-dimensional deterministic or\r\nstochastic differential equations.  The research focuses on\r\ntransport and mixing in random geophysical flows, nonlocal\r\ntransport in geophysical flows, variational methods for\r\ngeophysical models, and stochastic geophysical flow modeling.  In\r\nthe area of transport and mixing, the investigator quantifies\r\nfluid transport and mixing in geophysical flows by computing\r\nescape probability and mean resident time.  The work on nonlocal\r\ntransport studies the mean advective and eddy transport of\r\npassive tracers or pollutants in geophysical flows, when the eddy\r\ndiffusivity depends on time and space.  For the research on\r\nvariational methods for geophysical models, the investigator\r\ngains better understanding of the rotating shallow water\r\ndynamics, by studying steady patterns, spatial and temporal\r\nperiodic patterns and homoclinic motions via emerging techniques\r\nin calculus of variations.  Finally, he derives a simplified\r\ncoupled atmosphere-ocean model by averaging over random wind\r\nforcing and over intrinsic fast waves, quantifies the\r\napproximation error of the averaged dynamics, and studies some\r\naspects of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system using this\r\naveraged model.\r\n     The geophysical flows in the oceans and the atmosphere\r\naffect our environment and our society in profound ways.  This\r\nproject is motivated by the need of better scientific\r\nunderstanding of the environment and global change.  The\r\ninvestigator takes random or uncertain effects into account to\r\ndescribe geophysical flows.  He develops both deterministic and\r\nstochastic, numerical and analytical techniques to understand\r\ncomplex geophysical flow phenomena.  This research improves our\r\nknowledge about dispersion, transport and mixing of pollutants in\r\nour environment, and about evolution and pattern formation of\r\ngeophysical flows.  The techniques resulting from this research\r\nare also useful in studying other emerging problems in\r\nengineering and applied sciences.\r\n",
