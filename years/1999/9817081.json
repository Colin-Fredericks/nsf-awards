 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer software being developed takes a non-mathematical description of a gene network, converts it into a set of differential equations, and then solves the equations to reveal how concentrations of network components change over time. The program includes facilities to search for values of these parameters that cause the network to produce the desired spatio-temporal pattern. A short cut which greatly speeds up the search has been found. Starting with a simple model involving products of just five of the segment polarity genes of Drosophila, it has been found that the best-characterized interactions between those genes could not account for the segment polarity pattern. This initial failure pointed to several unexpected experimental results and the resulting network is surprisingly robust to changes in parameter values. The network can also readily produce, with different parameter values, a few characteristic patterns other than the biological segment polarity pattern. Both of these results may have evolutionary implications. This preliminary work will be extended to encompass the following objectives: a) to find out how and if the transcriptional control and post-transcriptional modification mechanisms so far discovered combine to explain the observed spatio-temporal patterning behavior of this network in wild type and mutant fly embryo blastoderms, b) to experimentally measure the values of certain parameters that affect crucially this model's behavior, c) to experimentally test certain transcription regulation steps pinpointed by the model as all important links, d) to comprehend how, later in development and modified by participation of other genes, the same network establishes the anterior/posterior compartment boundary in imaginal discs.\r\n\r\nA computer simulation approach for integrating known interactions among cross-regulatory genes into a quantitative mechanistic model has been developed. Further refinement and experimental testing will be done. Software that will serve as a tool for developmental biologists in both research and teaching will be continued to be developed and made available in a timely fashion.\r\n",
