 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although pain sensation is an adaptive function that protects us from injury and promotes healing, there are situations during which experiencing pain would be detrimental to survival. During acutely stressful \"fight-or-flight\" encounters, animals (including our evolutionary ancestors) that were able to ignore pain resulting from injuries were more likely to survive. This phenomenon, known as stress-induced analgesia (SIA) occurs in both humans and other animals and can be studied in the laboratory. A complete understanding of the physiology of brain analgesia mechanisms can open the door for the development of novel treatments for (difficult to treat) chronic pain conditions that take advantage of the brain's own pain killing abilities.\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with understanding sex differences in the brain chemicals (neurotransmitters) that are responsible for producing analgesia in response to stress. Both males and females exhibit SIA, however, we have shown that males and females use different neurotransmitters to inhibit pain. These studies will focus on sex-specific analgesia pathways in laboratory mice. We will determine how female sex hormones like progesterone influence the neurotransmitters that are used to produce SIA by administering progesterone and its metabolites to male and female mice that have undergone removal of their own hormonal influences via surgical excision of ovaries or testes. We will then assess which neurotransmitters are used to produce pain inhibition in response to stressful situation (a forced swim in cold water). A complete understanding of the hormonal basis for an important sex difference in analgesia pathways is necessary for the possible development of effective treatments of pain in both men and women that may be derived from the research laboratory.\r\n",
