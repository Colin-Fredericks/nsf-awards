 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project carrier out an investigation of strength and stiffness-based methods to reduce hinging in columns of reinforced concrete frames subjected to strong ground motion.  Current provisions to reduce the likelihood of hinges forming in the columns of a frame require that the total flexural capacity of the columns framing into a joint exceed that of the girders.  The effectiveness of this criterion is limited by the uncertainty of actual member flexural capacities under dynamic loads.\r\n\r\nThe research under this project will develop specific strength and stiffness criteria for frame members so as to eliminate yielding in columns in critical regions of a frame and provide minimum localized distortions during response to strong ground motion.  An analytical procedure will be developed to include member stiffness and varied strength and stiffness properties over the height of the structure.  Structures with soft stories will also be considered in the study.  Criteria will be identified for two situations those that would eliminate yielding of any column, and those that would limit yielding to a specified \"optimum\" level of building height.  The selected criteria will be evaluated using a series of proportioned frames with nonlinear static and dynamic analyses.  In addition, several existing frames that were instrumented during the Northridge earthquake will be analyzed based on the existing properties and properties modified to satisfy the proposed criteria.  This study is expected to provide new strength and stiffness criteria for building frames that will reduce the probability of columns yielding in critical locations of the building frame.  \r\n",
