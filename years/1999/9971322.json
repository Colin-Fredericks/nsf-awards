This study seeks new, fundamental\r\nunderstanding of the the effect of the multiscaled, long-range\r\ncorrelated random flows on large scale transport.  Using the ideas of\r\nsampling drift, eddy diffusivity, variational principles  and other\r\nmethods we show that non-Markovian transport, such as fractional\r\nBrownian motions, arises in certain random flows with long-range\r\ncorrelations, and it stands as an alternative macro-transport model to\r\nMarkovian transport, such as Brownian motion.  For wave transport, we\r\npropose a phase-space approach by means of the Wigner transform.  We\r\nshow that a middle range of sound frequencies couples with the flow\r\nfield: they convert into each other through mutual scattering and\r\nstretching.  Transport of waves at long times can be described by\r\nradiative transfer equations.\r\n\r\nTransport in fluid flows is ubiquitous.  Transport of particles and\r\nwaves is among the most important mechanisms affecting environment or\r\nglobal change; it is also a fundamental process in chemical engineering\r\nand materials processing. Natural or engineering flows are very\r\ncomplicated due to primarily the presence of phenomena of many\r\ndifferent length scales. We study these multiple-scale phenomena for a\r\nstandard model by a rigorous, novel approach.  We introduce a new\r\nframework, concepts and methods which will be very useful for\r\nunderstanding transport in general fluids with multiple scales.\r\n",
