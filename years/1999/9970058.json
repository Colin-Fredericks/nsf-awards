This work is expected to have relevance both to magneto-optical data recording and to high-density perpendicular magnetic recording media.  Magneto-optical digital information storage uses the Kerr rotation of the medium for data readout.  The medium must also have certain magnetic characteristics suitable for stable information storage including perpendicular easy axis magnetic anisotropy, a square loop, and high coercivity.  The advent of the nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effect introduces a new set of research challenges to materials suitable for magneto-optical applications.  In particular, the fact that the nonlinear Kerr angle is greatly enhanced over the linear angle expands the choice of materials greatly.  With a large Kerr angle, other factors in determining the figure of merit can be emphasized in identifying technologically prospective materials.\r\n\r\nMOKE measurements will be carried out on a series of Co/Pt and similar multilayer samples with different Pt thicknesses to probe the details of the magnetic structure and magnetic aftereffect in a systematic way and to model these results.  The research will entail the development and application of new and advanced macroscopic hysteresis models for both longitudinal and perpendicular recording media, based on the Preisach approach.\r\n\r\nMOKE measurements will also be performed during the in situ growth of magnetic films and multilayers, in a special electrochemical cell we will design and install in our MOKE apparatus.  The changes in the magnetic properties of a layer as a function of its thickness will be explored using linear MOKE, and the magnetism at the interface between the magnetic film and the substrate will be monitored with NLMOKE.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
