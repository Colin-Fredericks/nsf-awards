For example, the billiard ball flow of a rational polygon belongs to a natural moduli space of flows, and the system's periodic asymptotic behavior can be deduced from knowledge of the moduli space.  Although, the geodesic flow and the Laplace spectrum are known to be related via trace formulae, physicists have long believed in a more direct relationship provided by the `correspondence principle'.  This relationship will be considered in the context of the moduli space theory.\r\n\r\nThe objects under study are models for physical systems.  In particular, we consider here the asymptotic behavior of particles, both classical and quantum, under varying conditions. The systems we consider exhibit a high degree of chaotic behavior as is often the case in the real world.  Although these systems are simple abstractions, they represent a testing ground for further understanding of real world systems.  Eventual 'downstream' applications could include high energy physics and cryptography. \r\n",
