 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research consists of two projects that examines different aspects of the dynamics of law.  The first project investigates whether it can reasonable be claimed that case law eventually settles down to uncontroversial rules, whether California judges are more activist than judges elsewhere, and what determines whether a case eventually becomes influential in legal rule making.  Legal scholars differ in their beliefs on the extent to which courts are bound by earlier judges' decisions (\"precedent\").  Although there have been several empirical studies of judicial activism a the highest level, the Supreme Court, and much theoretical reasoning about the motives of judges, there has been little statistical analysis of how precedent operates in practice.  This has largely been due to the absence of a data set.  The research will use one of the primary tools for legal research, Shepard's editing marks, as a data base for understanding how case law evolves in practice at the more prosaic level of appellate courts.\r\n\r\nIntellectual property is an incentive system with many well-known defects. Project two explores alternative procurement mechanisms that bypass patents and asks whether, when burdened with realistic institutional restrictions, the alternatives are really an improvement.  It also examines the technological reality that research is cumulative, and how research exemptions in intellectual property law affect the division of profit among generations of innovators.  Finally, the study investigates the degree to which the firms in a patent race can untangle each other's private information on the value of the investment and their relative efficiency, simply by observing each other's investment behavior.",
