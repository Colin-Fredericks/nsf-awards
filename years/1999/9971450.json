 "awd_abstract_narration": "The adequate numerical treatment of nonlinear phenomena governed\r\nby partial differential\r\nequations with several\r\ndisparate scales is a formidable computational challenge. Modern\r\nalgorithms should be able to resolve fine scales for certain physical\r\nquantities without overresolving others, thereby optimizing the\r\ncomputational effort and making realistic 3d simulations feasible.\r\nPhase transitions in materials science, epitaxial growth,\r\nviscous incompressible fluids, and chemotaxis\r\nare typical yet quite distinct examples. \r\nThe goal of this project is to design, test, and\r\nanalyze reliable and efficient adaptive finite element methods \r\nfor such problems, with \r\nspace-time error control and based on\r\nrefinement/coarsening mesh modification.\r\nThis project builds\r\nupon our novel theory for a posteriori\r\nerror estimation of evolution problems; in fact it extends and \r\nenhances the prior NSF Grant\r\nDMS-9623394. It blends quite delicate analytical and computational \r\nissues, and applies them to free boundary problems, constrained\r\nproblems, and advection-diffusion equations.\r\n\r\nThis project has strong connections with areas of strategic interest\r\nsuch as Materials Science, Micro Electronics and High-Performance\r\nComputing, in that it addresses central issues to all of them\r\nsuch as the development of reliable and \r\nefficient algorithms. \r\nThis is a collaborative project involving a number of scientists\r\nin the US and abroad, as well as several students. \r\nA substantial effort is devoted to education\r\nand human resource development. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
