This symposium has been held every 2 to 4 years since the first meeting in Manchester, England in 1986, with the location alternating between the United States and an overseas country.  The current symposium is focussing on new identification and classification methods, as well as physiological and metabolic activities as they relate to the aquatic environment.  Aeromonas and Plesiomonas genera represent a significant part of the aquatic microbiota, but are incompletely understood in terms of their genetics, identification, physiology and ecology.  There is increasing research in these areas, and this symposium will enable researchers to come together, share current information, and discuss priority areas for future research.   Funding is providing partial support for the operation of the meeting and travel funds for critical investigators who cannot otherwise attend the meeting.",
