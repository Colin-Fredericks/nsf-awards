DRISCOLL\t\tCTS-9904198\r\n\r\nThis is an experimental study to quantify, for the first time, the local propagation speed along the surface of a turbulent, premixed flame.  As bulges and cusps form on the wrinkled flame surface, certain flame segments propagate forward at unusually large speeds.  A PIV-PLIF ( particle imaging velocimetry- planar laser induced fluorescence) diagnostic has been used to measure propagation speed for an unsteady, curved, two-dimensional laminar flame that undergoes a flame-vortex interaction.  In this study, this technique is extended to the three-dimensional (3-D) flame case  by using two sets of orthogonal laser light sheets.  The effort includes (a) measurements of local propagation speed along a turbulent flame surface; (b) measurements of 3-D flame stretch rates; (c) identification of cusps and bulges in the flame front that yield abnormally large local propagation speeds and investigation of the physical reasons for these abnormalities; images allow correlation of fast flame propagation with the presence of a vortex, with flame curvature, or with the sharing of radicals between flame segments; (d) comparison of measured propagation speeds to those from advanced direct numerical simulations (DNS) from various groups; and to those predicted by the Theory of Flame Stretch.\r\nLocal propagation velocity is the key quantity that must be correctly modeled in order to develop large-eddy simulations (LES) of premixed and partially premixed combustion.  Such models offer the possibility of major new breakthroughs in turbulent combustion, including the development of low-polluting gas-turbine and internal-combustion engines.\r\n",
