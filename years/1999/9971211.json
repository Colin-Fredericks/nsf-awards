 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of California Santa Barbara supports the research of Professor Thomas R. Pettus.  The theme of the research is the development of a novel synthetic technology that processes carbon atoms in parallel during construction of the molecular framework.  The asymmetric method being pursued will seek the level of discrimination of naturally occurring enzymes without attempting to replicate the complex structure found in naturally occurring enzymes.  This method will combine \"2-directional synthesis\" and \"desymmetrization\" and will allow a structure to be built from either or both ends in an asymmetric manner, as enzymes do.  Synthetic routes to spongistatin, phorboxazole, and saframycin will be advanced using these concepts. \r\n\r\nChemical syntheses of sizable molecules often involves a lengthy and tedious effort that ends with the isolation of only small quantities of the desired final product.  Another way to synthesize many other pharmacological agents is by using enzymes that are able to make fairly specific molecular ensembles.  The work supported in this project will allow for laboratory synthesis of useful large organic molecules with a speed and efficiency similar to natural enzymatic methods. \r\n",
