The focus is on two main areas: the study, in the superconducting state, of the interaction of the injjected spins with a superconducting condensate and, in the normal state, the spin diffusion and spin conductivity.  The results of these studies will be measured values of the spin diffusion length, the relaxation time T2, and the spin resistance for high-Tc superconducting materials. Graduate students and postdoctoral research associates will be trained in forefront areas of condensed matter physics/materials science to constitute the next generation of researchers and engineers for the 21st Century.   Linkages will be developed between research and education, the main emphasis being the improvement of the introductory physics course.\r\n%%%\r\nThis CAREER project involves both a research and an education plan.  The research will be focused on as yet unstudied properties of the behavior of electrons in technologically important materials.  Graduate students and postdoctoral research associates will be trained in forefront areas of condensed matter physics/materials science to constitute the next generation of researchers and engineers for the 21st Century.  The education plan tries to build a linkage between research and education.  The teaching activities include a focus on the improvement of introductory physics courses with an active learning component and introduction of actual research experience into an undergraduate laboratory course.\r\n***\r\n",
