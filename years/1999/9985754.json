The conference is scheduled for the period, September 26 - October 1, 1999 in Davos, Switzerland.  The organizer is Professor Esin Gulari of the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at Wayne State University.  The conference covers fundamental and applied aspects of polymer synthesis and processing, particle generation, and reactions in supercritical fluids, with the purpose of improving the developing environmentally conscious approaches through employment of supercritical solvents.  The technical program secures the participation of lead scientists and engineers with academic and industrial affiliations from the USA and Europe as invited speakers.  The collective expertise of the selected speakers covers basic and applied aspects of materials synthesis and processing with supercritical fluids.  The site and the schedule of the meeting are arranged to promote interactions among the participants.  The National Science Foundation supports of $24,650 for sponsoring 14 invited speakers and 15 graduate students is proposed.  The particular goal is to achieve a ratio of two-to-one among the new and established researchers participating in the conference.  The NSF support will be instrumental in achieving this goal.\r\n",
