 "awd_abstract_narration": "9979403\r\nBalanis\r\n\r\nThe antenna is one of the fundamental distinctions between a wired and a wireless system. The design of the antenna impacts the development of each component - from the circuit design to the receiver structure and coding technique, as well as the channel access protocol - employed in future wireless communication networks. The most challenging environment for the design of each component is where the communication devices are extremely small, low power computing and consuming mobile terminals. Furthermore, these terminals may be able to move randomly and organize themselves in an ad hoc communication structure. Such a network of communication terminals is referred to as a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). It is proposed to investigate the use of adaptive antennas (i.e., smart antennas) to improve channel quality in a MANET. The design of a smart antenna for a MANET will pose many challenges in antenna, feed network, signal processing, receiver, and protocol designs.\r\n\r\nThe antenna must be designed to be conformal to the portable device and to adapt to the needs of the MANET. Depending on the needs of the MANET, the antenna will be designed to have different modes of operation from omni-directional to highly directive. A single antenna element will not be able to achieve these characteristics and therefore, a collection of elements, referred to as an array, will be needed. The array is a versatile antenna system and can perform many different functions (including scanning, beam forming, etc.) by primarily controlling the excitation amplitude and phase of its elements. The feed network devices and circuitry, and the signal processing algorithms which must be developed and also integrated into the entire system, will provide the desired excitation of the elements for the antenna to meet the needs of the MANET. The challenges to achieve these objectives include selection of the antenna element and array geometry, and the modeling of the antenna system. The physical realization of the selected antenna configuration and the integration of the antenna and feed network models as well as the analysis of the effect of the antenna on the overall system performance will be investigated. In addition, the modeling of the propagation channel (multi-path, fading, etc.) will also have fundamental impacts on the overall antenna system design.\r\n\r\nThe antenna feed network, consisting of controlling and matching devices and circuits, will require extensive analysis and design tools. To accomplish the tasks presented in this proposal, a large number of circuits operating at future communication frequencies (20-GHz range), including matching networks, low-noise and power amplifiers, oscillators, phase shifters, and mixers must be developed. The circuits will be highly compacted and fabricated in several layers to fit within the relatively small area available in a communication device. This task requires clever selection of the semiconductor material for fabrication, optimized semiconductor device structures, appropriate high-frequency circuit designs, and highly accurate device and circuit analysis tools. Moreover, the signal processing algorithms used in driving these circuits must be considered in the overall design.\r\n\r\nThe signal processing algorithms, to control and adapt the different modes of operation of the antenna, will be developed for analog and digital antenna beam-forming at high (20 GHz) frequencies. This work will include the development of algorithms for computation of gains and phases for use in analog phase shifters for the antenna array. Although phase shifters will be initially realized in the analog domain, a DSP algorithm will compute the gain and phase. The challenge here lies in the frequent computation of antenna parameters intended for operation in a rapidly changing environment such as a MANET. Digital realizations will be addressed by developing spatio-temporal signal processing algorithms for beam-forming. Channel coding may als0 be employed to provide diversity and to suppress residual interference for multi-user communications over fading channels. By using channel coding techniques, the same error rates with a lower signal-to-noise ratio may be obtained resulting in an improved battery life of each mobile terminal.\r\n\r\nFrom a networking point of view, smart antennas may improve the performance of current channel access techniques for MANETs and may allow for the development of new protocols. By employing an array of antennas, it may be possible to develop protocols to control the multiple access interference in the spatial dimension, as opposed to time or frequency, to further improve the performance delivered to the terminals operating in a MANET. The design of such channel access protocols is dependent on the signal processing technique used in the smart antenna system.\r\n***",
