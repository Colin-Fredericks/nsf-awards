 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department is upgrading a Varian EM-360A, 60-MHz, permanent magnet nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer to Fourier Transform (FT) capability, allowing our students to perform multinuclear, as well as 1 - and 2-D, NMR experiments. FT-NMR has expanded and simplified NMR spectroscopy, allowing for the routine and rapid acquisition of spectra of a variety of nuclei. Because FT technology is now the standard in industry and graduate education, exposure to FT instrumental methods is crucial for undergraduates today.  An upgrade of our current NMR spectrometer is the most economical and sensible option giving our students the exposure to FT technology that we want in our courses.  Use of the upgraded instrument puts FT technology into nearly every course of our chemistry curriculum, most importantly in our organic chemistry, instrumental analysis, biochemistry, and physical chemistry courses.  This project adapts experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education and from laboratory texts in order to achieve the curriculum-wide use of the NMR. \r\n",
