 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support for the above meeting sponsored by the Engineering Foundation. The chairpersons are Prof. George Georgiou of the University of Texas and Dr. Steven Lee of Merck. This conference series has been instrumental in addressing key bioengineering issues involving research and education. Biochemical Engineering X, held May 18-23, 1997 in Kananaskis, Canada, was attended by 176 attendees from 18 countries, with 60% from industry and the rest primarily from academia. It is one of the premier meetings for the bioengineering research community. The theme of the 1999 conference is \"Molecular Diversity in Discovery and Bioprocessing\".  Among the key sessions are:\r\nDiscovery and Production of Bioactive Small Molecules\r\nDiscovery and Design of Macromolecules\r\nExploiting Microbial Diversity\r\nBioinformatics for Molecular Diversity\r\nProduction of Complex Biologicals\r\nNew Analytical Tools for Molecular Discovery and Bioprocessing\r\nHigh Throughput Bioprocessing.\r\n\r\nThe conference will provide an excellent opportunity for U.S. researchers to network with foreign scientists in the field, many of whom come from countries with extensive bioengineering technology, e.g., Japan.\r\n\t\r\n",
