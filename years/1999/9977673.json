 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate the organizational determinants of the gender gap in the evaluative ratings which are used to determine promotions. The objective of this research is to further our understanding of why and how women in some organizations continue to be excluded from management. To date there have been no systematic studies of how gender inequalities could be caused by such a rating gap. Therefore, this research asks: Why does an evaluative rating gap between the sexes exist? Why is this gap greater in some workplaces than others? Five predictions derived from two alternative models of gender inequality in organizations will be examined using comparative data from four agencies of the Uruguayan State (the Ministry of Public Health, the Ministry of Education, the Financial Bank, and the Bank of Social Prevision). According to the \"structural model\" it is expected that the gender ratings gap will be larger in organizations where the structure of work (proportion of women, job visibility, and management task uncertainty) reinforces superior's biased judgments. In contrast, according to the \"gendered logic model\" it is expected that the gender ratings gap will be larger in organizations where gender bias is embedded in the way the evaluation factors are constructed (i.e., in the tasks/skills included in the factors and the factor weights). In order to examine these expectations three data sources will be used in each of the four organization: a survey of supervisors, organizational memoranda, and aggregate quantitative information about each organization. This project will add to our growing knowledge about the causes of gender inequalities in organizations by analyzing one of the key factors in organizational promotions, the evaluations that superiors make of their subordinates.",
