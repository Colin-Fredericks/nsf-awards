Mario Amzel of Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine and Alberto Podjarny of the University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France.  The objective of their research is to develop methods (algorithms) and computational tools for the refinement, analysis, and modeling of protein structures that are obtained by using very high-resolution X-ray crystallographic data.  These new tools are needed to take advantage of high intensity synchrotron radiation sources and very sensitive detectors. These advanced facilities and equipment have created opportunities to study biomolecules more accurately than ever.  The computations will be performed in cooperation with Dr. Raul Cachau of the National Cancer Institute's  Biomedical Supercomputer Center.\r\n\r\nDr. Amzel brings to this collaboration expertise in crystallographic structure determination and refinement.  This is complemented by the expertise of the French investigator, who is a computational crystallographer.  Their joint effort will advance the ability to refine crystal structures through the development of new computational tools.   \r\n",
