 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis proposal requests support for a series of five political methodology conferences during the 1999-2003 period.  These conferences extend the mdoel developed with NSF support since 1986.  These conferences move in new directions by:  (1) opening participation to more graduate students and faculty was previously possible; (2) expanding the program to attract explicitly scholars in areas that previously have made less use of quantitative methodology; (3) adding a one-day introduction for graduate students that provides a foundation for the more advanced topics to be addressed in presented papers.  Each meeting consists of approximately 100 political methodologists drawn from both junior and senior faculty and a substantial number of advanced graduate students.  The conferences provide a forum for the presentation, discussion, and evaluation of work at the methodological frontier of political science.",
