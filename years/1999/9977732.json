 "awd_abstract_narration": "9977732\r\nChung\r\n\r\nMultilayer coatings are at the forefront of advanced coating development for many applications e.g. tribological coatings, optical films, x-ray mirrors, sensors etc. Graded layer thicknesses and compositions are of particular interest in meeting design needs, and sophisticated systems/controls are needed to create these structures. The coating performance critically depends on the layer thicknesses, intrinsic stress, surface roughness, microstructure etc. Careful control of process parameters (pressure, gas composition, plasma density, substrate temperature etc) is critical in obtaining reproducible and high-quality films.  An advanced multi-target magnetron sputter-deposition system will be acquired using Major Research Instrumentation support. The system will include in situ monitoring tools including an optical emission spectrometer, mass spectrometer and ellipsometer that will provide precise partial pressure information and real-time phase identification of the deposited films, enabling the investigator to monitor both the plasma environment and the growth process in real time. Precision substrate rotation results in accurate thickness control for individual layers in a multilayered coating. The sputtering system will have the provision for four planar and one cylindrical magnetron source. It will have the capability to deposit multilayers on large 3D parts of cylindrical geometry. The magnetron sources provide enhanced magnetic field strength as well as improved field configuration to effectively trap secondary electrons to increase ionization fraction in the plasma. Under optimum substrate bias conditions, this system may permit the growth of crystalline thin films at much lower substrate temperatures. With the proposed system, the investigators will have the flexibility to use small targets for basic and exploratory studies, and large targets for uniform deposition on engineering substrates. \r\n\r\nA multi-target magnetron sputter-deposition system with monitoring tools will be acquired with funds from the Major Research Instrumentation program. This instrumentation will be housed in the Advanced Coating Technology Group and will be used in the research programs of investigators from the Departments of Materials Science and Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Physics at the university. In addition, it will be available for use by members of the Industrial Consortia and the Technology Corporate Partners of the Group.  The educational impact of the instrument will be high as it will be used for teaching and research training for people from high-school science teachers through the graduate and post-doctoral students working on research projects.\r\n \r\n",
