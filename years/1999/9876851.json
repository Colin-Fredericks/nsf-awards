 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Museum of Minnesota will relocate and rehouse its paleontology collections, which will be moving into the museum's new million facility beginning in the second half of 1999.  This project will support the acquisition of new compactor carriages and shelves, cabinets, and associated packing materials as well as a full-time curatorial assistant to help with the project.\r\n\r\nThe paleontology collections are among the museum's most notable, and contain several nationally and internationally important specimens and series.  They include over 20,000 catalogued specimens with catalogued and accessioned lots and uncatalogued items that total approximately 400,000 items.  Highlights of the paleontology collection include a first-class suite of fossil reptiles-including Jurassic and Cretaceous dinosaurs, primary types of taxa of crocodiles, champsosaurs, and chelonians.  Other collections of note are Green River fish, Oligocene mammals, representative Minnesota invertebrates from the Paleozoic, and Quaternary collections from Minnesota.\r\n\r\nIn the new facility, central collections storage will increase from the current 3,350sq. ft. to 11,340 sq. ft.  The new storage vault will have state-of-the-art environmental controls and will be located immediately adjacent to curatorial offices, study labs (with digital photography installations, preparation spaces, and fully equipped work stations and microscopes).  Most of the facilities of the Research and Collections Division will be housed on one floor in the core of the building, with direct access by secured elevator to a\r\nloading dock and immediate access to exhibit halls.\r\n",
