There exist various analogs and simplifications of the problem proposed by Arnold, Ilyashenko, Pugh and others. Each of these simplified versions requires an upper estimate of the maximal possible number of limit cycles in some specific class of differential equations. This class depends on a parameter which is typically a degree of some polynomial involved in the definition of the class. The required quantities are called \"Hilbert type numbers.\" The present project deals with Abel and Lienard equations, quadratic vector fields, and zeros of Abelian integrals. Related simplified versions of the Hilbert 16th problem were stated during last three decades, but with very few exceptions, they too remain unsolved. The main objective of this project is to give some upper estimates of  \"Hilbert type numbers,\" not for the whole class for which these numbers are defined, but for some reduced set of equations. On the one hand, these estimates should greatly extend our present knowledge. On the other hand, they will hopefully provide tools for finding explicit upper estimates for analogs of the Hilbert numbers in their original setting.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this century, Hilbert presented a list of problems intended to predict the development of mathematics over the course of the ensuing hundred years. Now, at the end of the century, it is clear that his prediction was correct. For the most part, the Hilbert problems have been solved, and their solutions are highlights in the recent  history of mathematics. Some of the problems, however, remain unsolved. Among these is the second part of Hilbert's 16th problem.  It requires an upper estimate for some quantitative geometric characteristics of polynomial differential equations in the plane.  These characteristics are called \"Hilbert numbers.\" Not a single Hilbert number has been found up to the present time, despite tremendous efforts by brilliant mathematicians throughout the century. It is clear now that the way to the solution must proceed through simplifications of the problem. Simplified problems require estimations for the same geometric characteristics, but for classes of equations which are less complicated than those in the original Hilbert problem. It is the hope that solutions to these simplified versions will furnish tools for attacking the original problem. The beauty of planar differential equations is that questions and answers in this theory can be illustrated by pictures understandable to a broad audience. On the other hand, the solutions may involve deep results from different domains of mathematics like algebraic geometry, complex analysis, topology and so on. The methods developed in the theory of planar differential equations find numerous applications on the boundary of mathematics with other disciplines such as catastrophe theory, applied mathematics, biological modelling, etc. For this reason, the subject is attractive to young mathematicians, some of whom (including students of the Principal Investigator) have made significant contributions to the field. \r\n",
