Koss will concentrate on systems that can be realized as factors of one-sided Bernoulli shifts where points are identified with respect to a group action. In particular, the research will focus on finding independent generating partitions that give an isomorphism to a one-sided Bernoulli shift of maximal entropy for complex toral endomorphisms, rational maps of the sphere with parabolic orbifold, and Ueda maps of complex projective space. Koss will also investigate whether a group factor of a one-sided Bernoulli shift must be one-sided Bernoulli.\r\n\r\nThe field of dynamical systems is the study of how systems change over time. It has many applications to physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and computer science, such as describing the motion of planets, the change of population in a certain species, or the errors that can occur in the transmission of computer data. The study of chaotic or random behavior in dynamical systems is an exciting and relatively new area, and many mathematical tools have been developed to distinguish between different types of random processes. This project involves an exploration to discover systems that exhibit maximal random behavior, meaning those that can be modeled by the toss of a fair die. In addition to its inherent mathematical interest, this research represents one step towards a more thorough understanding of chaotic behavior, which in turn can help with the construction of more accurate models for predicting outcomes in the physical world.\r\n",
