 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of this project the investigator is continuing the research and writing required to produce a book tentatively titled Spirits. Serpents, and Skulls: Science at the Margins in the Age of Darwin, being prepared under contract from Johns Hopkins University Press as part of its new series: Introductory Studies in the History of Science. The press has initiated this series because very little has been written at an introductory level in the history of science. We live in a culture where science permeates virtually every aspect of our lives. However, most people are woefully ignorant of what distinguishes science from other types of knowledge and they lack any sense of the historical development of scientific ideas. This project uses three historical case studies -- phrenology, spiritualism, and sea serpents -- to address these issues within the context of Darwin's theory of evolution. It also will illustrate how history is useful for understanding the present by exploring questions that these earlier episodes raise for present day research.\r\n\r\nProfessionals within the discipline need to make an effort to have their work reach a broader audience. This book will contribute to the education of students and the general public by providing highly entertaining and accessible material to discuss a variety of important questions concerning the theory, practice, and content of science. However, this work is not merely to make accessible what is already known. There are several aspects of the project which are quite original. First, to use evolutionary theory as the connecting link for these 3 examples of marginal science is a novel idea that will further our understanding of the Victorian era as well as of the nature of scientific practice. Furthermore, the treatment of evolution differs from earlier studies that do not usually see natural selection as a marginal science. The research on sea serpents is original and this project will allow the author to write up those results. While most scholars have dealt with one specific example of \"pseudo-science,\" the comparative approach will allow the author to explore in depth the interest in marginal sciences as a 19th century phenomena. Finally, to explore the relevance of these historical episodes for present day research is an original idea and will contribute significantly to the ongoing discussions about the nature of science and society.\r\n",
