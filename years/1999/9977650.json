 "awd_abstract_narration": "9977650\r\nWeliky\r\n\r\nA solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer will be acquired with Major Research Instrumentation funds.   Two probes for the NMR will also be acquired: a general purpose triple resonance Magic Angle Spinning XYH probe and a high temperature (750 C) probe for studies of molten metal fluxes.  The new spectrometer will have substantially improved radio frequency technology including faster pulse rise times, faster phase shifting and much finer amplitude control, as well as greatly improved rotor synchronization.  These improvements should greatly enhance performance of contempo-rary multiple-pulse solid state NMR experiments.  In addition, the new spectrometer will have three radiofrequency channels so that a greater variety of experiments can be performed, particularly for atomic-level structural measurements on biological and inorganic materials.  The new spectrometer will be located in the Max T. Rogers NMR Facility, a shared University resource which is also open to outside academic institutions and companies.  The new spectrometer will  be shared by nine research groups at the university.  Solid state NMR spectroscopy is a dominant technique for chemical, structural, and dynamical characterization of non-crystalline materials.  The new spectrometer will be used for characterization, structural, and dynamical studies of 1) biologically significant peptides and proteins in membrane and frozen solution environments, 2) new mesostructured silica and alumina materials, 3) new polythiophosphate and  polyselenophosphate materials and high temperature fluxes, 4) cross-linked and surface-bound copolymers, 5) products of combinatorial syntheses, 6) electrides and alkalides, 7) biological polyhydroxybutyrate/podyphosphate ion channels, 8) carbon and/or glass fiber reinforced composite materials, and 9) wood products and preservatives.  \r\n\r\nAcquisition of a new nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer with Major Research Instrumentation funds will greatly enhance the research infrastructure at Michigan State University and benefit the fifty faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows who use solid state NMR in their research.   In addition, undergraduate students at the MSU Research Experience for Undergraduates site will have a unusual educational opportunity in performing research on this instrument.\r\n",
