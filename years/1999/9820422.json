 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Program and Center for the Integrative Study of Animal Behavior (CISAB) was established at Indiana University in 1990 with the aid of a National Science Foundation Research Training Group (RTG) Grant. Over the past 8 years we have gathered a group of 81 faculty, postdoctoral, and graduate researchers who work collaboratively to combine approaches from individual disciplines in order to better understand animal behavior. Renewal of our REU Site Award in Animal Behavior would allow us to continue bringing 10 undergraduates each summer to Indiana University to spend 10 weeks conducting research under the direction of CISAB scientists. These interns are recruited primarily from groups' under-represented in science and from schools that cannot offer intensive research training. Interns have the opportunity to complete their own research projects, analyze and prepare their findings, and present these findings at a concluding symposium. In addition, interns meet regularly for: (1) a series of introductory faculty research presentations that introduces them to the research issues and diverse approaches used in the study of animal behavior, (2) a workshop on ethics and conduct in science; and (3) classes on mentoring and career issues offered in conjunction with the campus-wide Summer Research Opportunities Program. The central goal of this program, like all REU programs, is to give students an intensive research experience and an introduction to the conduct of science as a profession. Particular to this proposal is a second important goal, that of introducing students to interdisciplinary modes of thinking and research that will allow them to apply a variety of perspectives and techniques to the study of animal behavior.\r\n",
