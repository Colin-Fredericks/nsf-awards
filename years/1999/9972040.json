 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on mathematical problems arising from the\r\nstudy of liquid crystal materials, especially on understanding\r\nstatic configurations flow patterns. One area of the research is to \r\nstudy the defect and molecule configurations\r\nof minimizing solutions of the liquid crystal energies under\r\ndifferent (both strong and weak anchoring) boundary conditions and\r\nexternal fields. Such energies include the Oseen-Frank energy for nematic\r\nliquid crystals, the Landau-de Gennes energy for smectic ones, etc.. The\r\nawardeee will apply the regularity theory for solutions of partial differential \r\nequations to these problems. Liquid crystal materials also experience complicated\r\nphase transitions under different conditions. A systematic effort will be\r\nmade to study the stability of the configurations and bifurcation\r\nphenomena in different regimes. Finally this research addresses \r\nthe dynamic properties of different types of liquid crystals. Recent\r\nexperimental and theoretical results indicate that there is an interesting\r\ncoupling between the molecule director field and the flow velocity field.\r\nTherefore it is important to consider these vector fields simultaneously\r\nand study the interaction between them. The proposer will investigate\r\nboth the theoretical and computational aspects of this coupling problem.\r\nThe focus is to illustrate the flow effects on  the different configurations. \r\nThe anisotropic characteristics of the material will cause the flow \r\nto exhibit non-Newtonian features which in turn corresponds to defects and\r\ndifferent molecule patterns.\r\n\r\nAs a special phase of matter, liquid crystals were discovered\r\nmore than a century ago. Liquid crystal displays (LCD)\r\nhave been widely used in industries. The fundamental research\r\nof such materials is very important. For example, the presence of defects\r\nnot only affects the manufacturing procedure of the devices,  but also\r\nprovides a new kind of display where the defects contributes to higher\r\naccuracy and memory of the material under external fields. This research will\r\nfocus on mathematical models for liquid crystals, in particular on possible defect\r\nconfigurations and their behavior over time.  This study of static and \r\ndynamic defect structures will help to improve the modeling and design\r\nof such devices. Moreover, an improved understanding of liquid crystals \r\nhas benefits for broader classes of materials that are important, such as\r\npolymeric and biological materials.\r\n\r\n",
