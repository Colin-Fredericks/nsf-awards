 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tDecisionmakers are overwhelmed frequently by the vast amounts of information which they must consider.  They are forced often to make partially informed decisions which ignore critical issues because of the complexity of the situation being analyzed.  This tendency becomes even more pronounced in international crisis situations, characterized by threat to basic values, finite (often short) time for response, and heightened probability of involvement in military hostilities.  These elements all contribute to the possibility that individual decisionmakers are overwhelmed with detail and possibly unable to identify optimal outcomes, either individually or collectively.  The vast literature on crisis decisionmaking shows that situations of intense crisis can create a reduced span of attention, cognitive rigidity, and a distorted perspective of time.  These factors combine to make utility maximization difficult to attain.\r\n\tThe research proposed here attempts to address these structural problems associated with decisionmaking in crisis by focusing on the negotiation process used to manage and resolve disputes which reach crisis proportions.  The development of decision support systems for crisis negotiation is proposed as a means of reducing complexity and aiding in the evaluation of utilities associated with possible outcomes.  With a decision support system in place, two specific aspects of the negotiation process are targeted for investigation:  (1) the differential impact of general versus domain-specific cognitive complexity levels among crisis negotiators on negotiation processes and outcomes, and (2) the impact of various types of mediation on the outcome of negotiation.  We propose that when negotiators are equipped with tools which allow them to make projections and evaluate the utilities associated with alternative proposals, coupled with their greater understanding of the cognitive capacities which adversaries bring to the negotiation table, and with the intervention of mediators, they increase their ability to resolve conflicts.  Such parties should emerge from the experience having achieved mutual benefit, and therefore having laid the foundation for the long-term resolution of the underlying conflict.  The experimental design which we propose is uniquely capable of facilitating a better understanding of how these elements fit together in an efficient and effective conflict-management strategy.\r\n\tThis research program builds on our earlier work in the development of a strategic model of negotiation.  Originally developed to address the problem of achieving cooperation among autonomous agents in distributed computational settings, this work led to the application of this model to crisis negotiation and bargaining situations through the creation of a decision support system for crisis negotiators.  This decision support system has been implemented recently in a Hostage Crisis simulation setting to support experimental work on cognitive complexity and crisis outcomes.  In addition, we have started conceptual work on a second crisis scenario and its associated decision support system, based on a fishing dispute, which allows us to look more closely at the role which different types of mediation can play in crisis negotiation. \r\n",
