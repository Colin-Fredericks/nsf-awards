 "awd_abstract_narration": "9814468\r\nLiou\r\nPrevious studies allowed identification of two distinct types of garnet peridotites in the Sulu-Dabie ultra-high pressure (UHP) terrane. Type A peridotites represent fragments of the mantle wedge of the Sino-Korean plate and Type B peridotites are crustal-derived mafic-ultramafic complexes of the Yangtze plate emplaced into continental crust prior to subduction. Olivine, garnet, and pyroxene of these peridotites contain minute mineral inclusions that may be very high-P phases or dense hydrous magnesian silicates.  Furthermore, the most negative delta 18-oxygen values ever recorded for garnet, omphacite and phengite suggests extremely limited fluid/rock interactions during UHP metamorphism and subsequent exhumation; thus primary mantle features are expected to be well preserved. This research bridges the gap between mantle petrology and mineral physics and will address the following questions: (1) Can UHP garnet peridotites provide new constraints on petrotectonic processes of the upper mantle? (2) What can geochemical microanalyses of minerals contribute to understanding the processes of mantle-slab and rock/fluid interactions? (3) What is the significance of exsolution lamellae in UHP minerals? (4) What other mineralogical evidence records the UHP metamorphism of garnet peridotites? Major thrusts on both core and surface samples from the Sulu terrane include: (1) petrological characteristics and metamorphic evolution of garnet peridotites; (2) geochemical constraints for their source and initial tectonic setting; (3) both radioactive and stable isotopic compositions to evaluate interactions of crust/mantle and rock/fluid; and (4) age determinations by various methods including SHRIMP dating of zircons. Such comprehensive petrochemical and geochronological constraints are prerequisites to evaluate the nature of the upper mantle associated with continental collision and subduction.\r\n",
