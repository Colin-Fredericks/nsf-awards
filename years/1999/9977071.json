The award will contribute to implement the multi-campus Ph.D. model as an academic program. While increasing the participation of women and minorities in graduate education, the project will facilitate, enhance, and intensify research in CISE areas.\r\nThe project will reinforce and support the following research groups: \r\nScientific Computing Group,  \r\nSoftware Sciences and Engineering Group, and\r\nAutomated Information Processing and \r\nDigital Systems Implementation Group. \r\n\r\nThese groups conform the core of the CISE multidisciplinary research environment, foster the formation of new multidisciplinary groups, and partner with industry, government, and universities in research projects of mutual interest.  A Computing Research Seminar will be established as a formal forum for the discussion of common grounds of CISE areas, and the presentation of frontier research.  A Computer Research Laboratory will be developed to support the proposed research and training activities. \r\n\r\nThrough this effort, the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez is expected to develop further its computing science and engineering research capabilities involving minority students in greater numbers, paving the way for the conferring of more doctoral degrees to under-represented groups, particularly Hispanic and women in Computer Science and Engineering. It is hoped that through these efforts, the nation might find a successful model that will help in building a better racially and ethnically balanced technological enterprise for the benefit of its present and future generations.\r\n",
