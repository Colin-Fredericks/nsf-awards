 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proof-of-concept project supports the development and implementation of a new course in scientific programming based entirely on software freely available over the Internet.  The traditional computer-programming course for science majors is based primarily on a compiled programming language (Fortran or C) rather than on a user-friendly interactive and graphical interpreted environment.  This leads to significant barriers to the integration of computing into the subsequent  science course work.  The new scientific programming course utilizes the compiled programming language in the context of the freeware SCILAB, a computational environment similar to MATLAB that easily interfaces with Fortran or C subprograms.  The course focuses on science majors early in the academic career learning  to solve an array of computational and graphical problems representative of those encountered in undergraduate and graduate courses. A website designed to assist undergraduates in creating individualized suites of computational and graphical tools, based on the scientific programming course, for personal computer use is under development.\r\n",
