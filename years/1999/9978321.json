 "awd_abstract_narration": "9978321\r\n\r\nThis project considers the development and application of statistical methods in two scientific areas:  1) image analysis of geophysical data and 2) modeling of stated preference ratings data.  The recurring theme is to study the probabilistic model underlying each data structure.  The probabilistic modeling of images is based on the statistical structure of features in order to compress, reconstruct/synthesize, and statistically analyze the images.  The models are derived from the statistical dependencies between the basis coordinates of transformed images.  In particular, the proposed task is to develop a computationally efficient independent component analysis in an attempt to transform images into a set of independent components modeled by Gaussian processes.  If the dependent coordinate systems follow an ICA decomposition, the statistical dependency between basis coordinates will be modeled through Markovian processes.  As part of the study, validation measures are constructed to evaluate the image syntheses and reconstructions based on the probability models.  These measures are developed from the Edgeworth expansion of the Kullback-Leibler information statistic and differential entropy.  The study of stated preference ratings data considers probabilistic models for inferring the probabilistic structure of censored rankings underlying nominal ratings data.  The hierarchical Bayesian models developed will require computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo routines incorporating Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings steps for fitting the models and drawing appropriate inferences.\r\n\r\nThe project aims at developing computationally efficient statistical tools for probabilistic modeling of geophysical images and stated preference ratings data.  The image analysis methodologies are motivated by two specific geophysical problems to which the methods developed will be applied:  1) meteorological forecast verification and 2) geological classification.  The goal for forecast verification is to develop automated, computationally efficient routines to compare meteorological forecasts and observations at different geographical scales towards an evaluation of climatological forecast models.  The goal for geological classification is to develop automated, computationally efficient routines to classify sediments and rock formations based on computer learning and extraction of features from training data sets.  Each of these two\r\nApplications will incorporate methods developed by the project in feature extraction, compression, reconstruction/synthesis, and statistical modeling.  Methodologies for handling stated preference ratings data are motivated by two problems in program valuation to which the methods developed will be applied: 1) rating programs for mitigating impacts of global climate change and 2) rating programs for improving fish populations in Washington State.  In each application, the goal is the valuation of environmental programs through the consideration of many underlying attributes such as cost, species impact, and environmental impact, to name a few.  The statistical analysis will incorporate the probabilistic and econometric models and inferential tools developed by the project to study program ratings and preferences elicited from participants in the two studies.  This project is jointly supported by the Statistics Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) in MPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
