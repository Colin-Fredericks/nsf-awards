The PI is pushing ahead with these applications, in the following three directions:\r\n\r\nDevelopment of new techniques based on multicommodity flow to analyze geometric Markov chains (where the state space is the set of integer points inside a convex body).\r\n\r\nInvestigation of techniques such as Chebyshev acceleration, which can potentially modify a Markov chain so as to substantially speed up its convergence.\r\n\r\nImproved understanding of newly emerging connections between the rapid mixing property of certain Markov chains on the configurations of physical systems and the thermodynamic properties of those systems.\r\n\r\nIn parallel with recent activity aimed at classifying NP-hard optimization problems according to their degree of approximability, the PI is contributing to a similar classification of #P-hard counting problems.  Specific aims here include:\r\n\r\nInvestigation of novel algorithms for the central problem of approximating the permanent. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of approximation-preserving reductions between counting problems so that, for example, a class of problems that are equivalent to the permanent can be constructed.\r\n\r\nFinite metric spaces provide a clean and elegant paradigm that captures (and often streamlines) several previously ad hoc algorithmic ideas.  The third part of the project involves a systematic study of finite metrics, and specifically:\r\n\r\nThe design of new techniques for l1 embedding, both in the general case (to achieve a distortion within o(log n) of optimal) and for special metrics (such as those supported on planar graphs).  This has algorithmic applications to, among others, the central problem of approximating the sparsest cut in a network.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment of improved techniques for embeddings into low-dimensional spaces. These have applications to algorithms for ubiquitous problems such as nearest-neighbor searching and clustering.\r\n\r\nApproximation of complex metrics by simpler ones.  This would allow existing algorithms that work well for simple metrics (such as trees) to be applied more widely.\r\n",
