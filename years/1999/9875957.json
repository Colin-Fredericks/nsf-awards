 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been documented that African Americans and Latinos do not perform as well as Whites on standardized tests and in school. Explanations for this problem typically point to economic, cultural, and educational factors, and sometimes even to group differences in intelligence. However, these factors do not fully account for the observed differences because the differences persist even when students of different ethnicities are equated in their preparation, skill, and socioeconomic status. Other factors must be involved. The PI has documented the influence of a powerful psychological factor operating in academic and testing situations. This factor -- stereotype threat -- is an apprehension about confirming widely-held stereotypes alleging the academic inferiority of certain people (e.g., Blacks, Latinos) or of certain people in specific situations (e.g., women in mathematics domains). Stereotype threat can arise any time a negative stereotype is relevant or pertains to an academic or achievement setting (e.g., taking an intelligence test, being called upon in class). In past research, testing conditions designed to induce stereotype threat dramatically lowered the standardized test performance of African Americans, whereas conditions designed to minimize stereotype threat boosted performance. The current research uses carefully controlled laboratory experiments to examine (1) the factors that give rise to stereotype threat, (2) situational factors that can minimize or exacerbate it, (3) the psychological processes that govern its influence on achievement, and (4) possible long-term consequences stereotype threat on people's achievement-related behaviors and self-concepts.\r\n\r\n",
