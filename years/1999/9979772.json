 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCurricular documents recently published by both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science place at the core of science education.  However, recommendations for K-3 science curricula reflect considerable distance from this ideal, as a result of assumptions about primary grade children's development needs.\"  Science educators have derived these assumptions from cognitive developmental stage theory.  These constraints have resulted in curricula that poorly reflect the rich, goal-focused enterprise of the scientific inquiry.  \t\r\n\r\n\tFortunately, we have grounds to suspect that this way of inferring ceilings on children's scientific reasoning may seriously underestimate their capabilities.  As AAAS (1993) has noted, \"the developmental studies say more about what students...do not learn in today's schools than about what they might possibly learn if instruction were more effective.\"  Consideration of the potential impact of instruction on children's reasoning abilities is particularly important, given the robust research finding that the strength of one's knowledge of a domain strongly influences the adequacy of one's reasoning therein.\t\r\n\r\n\tThe proposed research re-examines the key issue of young children's capabilities and limitations in scientific inquiry, from the perspective of what is possible given more effective instruction.  Specifically, the research investigates:\t\r\n* What forms of scientific inquiry are within the reach of K-3 children, given effective and substained scaffolding?\t\r\n\t*What compromises do teachers need to make in order to bring scientific inquiry within reach of K-3 children?\t\r\n\t*What forms of instructional scaffolding can empower K-3 children's scientific inquiry, while simultaneously developing their interest in science?\t\r\n\r\n\tAnalysis of the children's learning will be based on the cognitive developmental parameters currently viewed as critical shortcomings in primary grade children's scientific cognition:  (a) the theory/evidence distinction; (b) the logic of research design and control of variables; and (c) hypothetical-deductive thought.  Explanations for why scientific inquiry needs to be postponed until the upper elementary school years or later are typically framed in terms of children's poor understanding within these spheres.  Given the importance of attitude and interest in academic engagement and success, we will also assess the impact of the instructional intervention on children's attitudes about science and their engagement in the science curriculum.\t\r\n\r\n\tResearch will be conducted within two instructional intervention models.  The systemic change instructional model will examine the power and limitations of children's scientific inquiry, under the most optimal learning conditions we can engineer.  These conditions include exceptional teachers with in-depth professional support, the latitude of fundamentally change both the science curriculum and its interface with its interface with the mathematics curriculum, availability of the best technological resources to support the children's developing knowledge of the domain, their data collection and data analysis, etc..  On the basis of their ongoing analysis and refinement of this instructional  model, the teacher/researcher team will analyze the teacher knowlege that is critical to its effectiveness.  Their aim will be to abstract the essential elements of the instructional model and subsequently to illustrate and explain this instructional approach in the form of two curricular \"replacement units\" (one in botany and one in animal behavior) and a supporting teacher professional development program.  These units, in conjunction with the professional development program, will function as a strategic instructional modification model.  We will test the instructional model and its scalability by studying its impact on two coherts of K-3 teachers and their students.  The project's timely re-assessment of children's scientifc reasoning capacities and elaboration of new instructional prototypes could provide the basis for fundamental improvements in K-3 science education\r\n",
