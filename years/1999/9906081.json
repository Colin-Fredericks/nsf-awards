The research is concerned with robust non-rigid image matching, which is required in a variety of domains. In robot vision, non-rigid matching is applied to the tracking of deformable objects. In medical imaging, it is needed in the non-rigid registration of brain structures. In pattern recognition, it is useful in matching handwritten characters and fingerprint minutiae. Also, non-rigid matching distance measures can be applied to clustering image databases.  \r\nThis project is to validate and evaluate a new approach to non-rigid image matching in the domain of human brain mapping. The new approach is based on minimizing integrated pose and correspondence objective functions using deterministic annealing methods derived from statistical physics. The basic theme is to derive new distance\r\nmeasures and algorithms for non-rigid matching by incorporating parameterized spline-based deformations into these objective functions. The non-rigid integrated pose and correspondence approach has a novel interpretation as weighted graph matching where the graphs are determined by the spline kernels. The graduated assignment algorithm, previously designed for general, inexact graph matching problems has been adapted to minimize these non-rigid matching objective functions. Here, an important task is the\r\nnon-rigid registration of cortical anatomical structures that have been extracted from different subjects' magnetic resonance brain images.\r\n",
