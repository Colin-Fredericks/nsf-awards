 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary purpose of this project is to enhance the digital design experience of students throughout the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) curriculum at the Dearborn campus of the University of Michigan. In recent years, industry has adopted the use of digital design tools that can significantly shorten the time required to complete a design and bring a product to market. These software and hardware tools include hardware descriptive languages, such as HDL and VHDL, field programmable gate arrays, and digital simulation packages, such as PowerView.  The core of the proposed project is a series of laboratory experiments that are spread over a 3-course sequence in digital systems. The first set of experiments is adapted from exercises in standard digital logic textbooks using state-of-the-art technology. This is followed by experiments adapted from tutorial examples provided by PowerView. The advanced experiments are adapted from ideas presented at an RASSP workshop on VHDL and a workshop conducted by Verilog.\r\nThe goal of the project is to integrate current design tools in a consistent and pedagogically sound manner throughout the computer engineering curriculum.",
