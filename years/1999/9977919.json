 "awd_abstract_narration": "A multi-summer research experience for undergraduates with strong quantitative training and interest in the application of mathematics to the natural or social sciences is offered. First year students are introduced to dynamical systems theory, stochastic processes, modelling of biological populations, and methods of simulation during the first three weeks of the program.  The last four weeks of the program are devoted to the development of mathematical models that  address student-generated questions in the natural or social sciences.   Students, in groups of 2-5, carry out the mathematical analysis and simulation of their models and use their results to write a technical report (20-30 pages) that responds to their original question.  Four to eight students are selected as second year students.  They serve as mentors while participating in a simultaneous  8-week summer program that builds on their first year research experience.  Second year students also produce a significant technical group report (2-3 students) that addresses a scientific question.  The program recruits extensively from institutions that have access to limited research opportunities and\r\nconsiders ethnicity and gender as part of the admission process. Students present their research at the end of the summer, at scientific conferences, and at the SACNAS national meeting.  The success of the program is measured by the quality of the research and by the number of non-traditional students who enroll in graduate school after their participation in our program. Students' progress is monitored  by the program's staff throughout the academic year.",
