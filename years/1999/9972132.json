Typically the underlying coefficients are \r\n`recurrent' (in particular quasi-periodic) functions of time. This includes \r\nexamples of forced oscillations and (finite as well as infinite dimensional) \r\nquantum oscillators with external (time dependent) quasi-periodic and \r\nergodic forcing fields. Many such examples have been numerically and \r\ntheoretically investigated recently. Motivated by these examples, the \r\nproject is geared towards finding precise analytical results. The standard \r\nmethod of proving stability results is via well established techniques like \r\nthe KAM technique or the use of `hyperbolicity'. On the contrary, in this \r\nproject we shall mainly focus on the unstable behavior. We analyze the \r\nstability properties of the linear system via the dynamical properties of \r\nsuitable `skew-product flows' associated with it. For example, instability \r\nof forced oscillations is captured in terms of the absence of point spectrum \r\nof the associated quasi-energy operator and this in turn is reflected in the \r\nergodic behavior of certain skew-product flows generated by the given \r\nlinear system.  Consequently our technique is a blend of methods of \r\ntopological dynamics, ergodic theory, and ideas from control theory. \r\nViewing the desired perturbations as `controls with certain constraints' \r\nallow us to apply methods of control theory to create chaotic behavior. \r\nWith this viewpoint and with the techniques developed thus far, the \r\nproject plans to examine questions of genericity and prevalence of chaotic \r\nor unstable behavior, absence of zero Lyapunov exponents, ergodicity and \r\nproximality for specific families of equations arising in physics and \r\nengineering. Finally the non-linear implications of the theory developed \r\nwill be examined by developing results about time-dependent (or non-\r\nstationary) linearization and normal forms.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates long term time evolution, particularly the \r\nunstable and chaotic behavior of certain classes of dynamical systems. \r\nMotivated by the recent theoretical and numerical study of forced quantum \r\noscillators with random or quasi-periodic forcing, this project plans to \r\nprovide the underlying analytical reasons and precisely predict the long \r\nterm behavior of such systems. The systems we consider model several \r\nmechanisms of practical and theoretical interest such as (a) behavior of \r\nelectrons and other `spin 1/2 particles' subjected to external random \r\nmagnetic fields, (b) phonon conduction and polarization of light in optical \r\nfibers, and (c) propagation through random media such as (quasi)-crystals \r\nwith irregularly distributed impurities. Typically most of the existing body \r\nof knowledge is about two extreme cases, namely either when the external \r\nforcing field has no randomness (e.g. is periodic) or is as random as can be \r\n(technically this means the process is stochastically independent). Using \r\nthe analytical tools of ergodic theory, topological dynamics and control \r\ntheory, the project will investigate finer details relating the chaotic nature \r\nof evolution of the system to the precise data about the nature of \r\n`correlation function' and `rate of mixing' of these random forcing \r\nprocesses. The project will attempt to find and identify the underlying \r\nfeatures of these systems that determine various types of unstable behavior \r\nand obtain quantitative information about quantities such as the Lyapunov \r\nexponents which are indicators of the degree of chaos. Some by-products \r\nof our investigations will have important implications to engineering \r\ndisciplines such as filtering theory and to systems and control engineering.\r\n",
