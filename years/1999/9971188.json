 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a unified research program of modeling, analysis\r\nand computation to better characterize and understand granular flows,\r\nin particular, granular flows in the presence of interstitial fluid.\r\nDry granular materials may be characterized as a fourth state of matter.\r\nGranular media can support stresses like a solid, but also\r\ncan flow like a liquid, or, under some conditions, like a gas.\r\nWhile deforming, a granular sample may dilate or consolidate,\r\ndepending on packing conditions.  These features lead to a dynamics \r\nof granular materials whose richness and scope rivals that of fluid dynamics.\r\nAt the same time, particle materials used in technological applications are\r\nbecoming smaller, and, consequently, the presence of interstitial fluid is\r\nbecoming increasingly important.  This is particularly true\r\nin the use of toner powders in xerography, where the small size\r\nof the power particles means higher quality copies.  As they move, these \r\nsmall light particles (about 10 micron diameter) are strongly influenced \r\nby the surrounding gas, and particle motion is intimately coupled to fluid motion.\r\nFurthermore, owing to van der Waals attraction, these toner powders\r\nare cohesive, often tending to clump.  The introduction of controlled \r\nfluid flow, through fluidization and vibration, is a common mechanism\r\nfor breaking the cohesive attractions and controlling particle motion.\r\nIn a very different application, new ideas for drying and coating\r\nlarger particles (about 500 micron diameter) use rapid vertical vibration \r\nof a flat plate to accelerate a granular mass.  Because of the large \r\nacceleration, interstitial fluid again plays an important role in the \r\nmotion of particles.  Theoretical and numerical techniques will be used to\r\ncharacterize state diagrams, study the stability of layers of fluidized powder\r\nunder tilting, and study the onset of bubbling and clumping.\r\n\r\nThe combined flow of particles and fluid has many other industrial\r\napplications, such as particle flow in pressurized vessels, cat-cracking,\r\ntransport by lubrication, and heat transfer.  In these applications, \r\ntransport and handling of powders presents a significant difficulty.\r\nWithout a better understanding of particle-fluid flows, products that\r\nexploit new particle technologies may not come on-line as quickly, nor with\r\nsufficient reliability.  In this regard, it is useful to\r\nnote a study by the Rand Corporation showing that, because of an\r\ninability to accurately predict powder behavior, solids-producing\r\nmanufacturing plants performed on average at 63% of design capacity,\r\ncompared to 84% for liquids-producing plants.\r\nThe analysis and computations performed during this project, together with\r\nexperiments by other academic and industrial researchers,\r\nwill help to provide the needed characterization of these flows. \r\n\r\n",
