University of Tennessee Knoxville\r\nTitle: New Debugging Techniques for One-Way, Dataflow Constraints\r\n\r\nOne-way, dataflow constraints are spreadsheet-like constraints that have found uses in a variety of applications, including graphical interfaces, programming environments, and circuit simulation. However, there is considerable evidence that one-way constraints are difficult to debug. The research focuses on developing a number of techniques to alleviate this problem, including: 1) Visualization techniques that allow programmers to examine the flow of information through the constraint system, 2) Incremental debugging techniques that will allow programmers to single-step through the constraint solving process, and 3) Explanation-based techniques that will allow the debugger to record significant events during the solving process and then analyze these events to help the programmer pinpoint the source of a bug. Better debugging and visualization techniques will have a number of significant benefits, including greater productivity among constraint users, greater reliability for applications, and greater acceptance for constraints outside the research and spreadsheet communities.  \r\n\r\n",
