 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores new methodologies for combinatorial synthesis and screening, based on Fourier transform analysis of one-dimensional libraries compiled on various types of threads.  The chemistry involves establishing compatible combinations of solid supports (cotton or other threads) and reagents appropriate for the synthesis of different types of molecules.  Application of the method to protein-binding peptides is proposed, as well as study of the binding selectivity of synthetic receptors and further development of data collection and analysis.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Alan W. Schwabacher of the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.  Dr. Schwabacher is exploring ways to make very large numbers of different molecules in minute quantities and in a single batch.  This is to be done in such a way that the properties of each type of molecule can be evaluated while keeping track of the exact structure of each molecule.  This makes possible the evaluation of a large number of potentially useful molecules without the need to synthesize each one separately, until after its properties are known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
