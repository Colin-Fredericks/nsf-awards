 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fuller \r\n9973712\r\n \r\nMembers of both the eusocial Hymenoptera (bees, ants and wasps) and Isoptera (termites) benefit by increasing genetic relatedness because non-reproductive individuals can achieve greater reproductive success by helping to rear siblings than by rearing their own offspring. The Hymenoptera achieve increased genetic relatedness by haplodiploidy; the diploid Isoptera may achieve similar levels of relatedness by inbreeding. In the Hymenoptera, multiple mating by queens (polyandry) and multiple queens within nests (polygyny) are common. Both decrease genetic relatedness among nestmates. At least 3 hypotheses have been proposed to explain the adaptive significance of genetic diversity in the Hymenoptera: 1) genetic variation enables colonies to allocate tasks such as foraging or guarding more precisely, 2) genetic variation enables colonies to withstand a wider range of abiotic conditions and 3) genetic variation allows colonies to resist a greater variety of pathogens. \r\n\r\nLess is known about the mating systems and level of genetic diversity among the termites. However, Fuller's observations indicate that workers within nests of the eusocial termite Nasutitermes acajutlae are genetically diverse. The goals of this POWRE project are first, to determine the source of genetic diversity in N. acajutlae, and second, to determine the adaptive significance of the genetic diversity. \r\nThe PI will collect N. acajutlae kings, queens and workers from nests on the island of St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. The relatedness of kings and queens within nests will be assessed using mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. The relative contribution of reproductives to the worker population will be assessed using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD). In addition, the 3 genetic diversity hypotheses will be tested using RAPDs.\r\nWhile many empirical studies have examined hypotheses 1) and 3), very few studies have examined these questions in the only other group in which eusociality is common - the termites. Because their genetic system differs so fundamentally the study of genetic variability in N. acajutlae, coupled with an examination of their mating system, will provide an important comparison to the Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
