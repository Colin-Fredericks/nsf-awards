 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the tremendous rise of visual representations in human interaction with computers, most of the underlying computation is still sentential - based on traditional string languages. This goal of this project is to enrich the interactive computational environment through the addition of spatially dense, non-sentential representations.  The PI and his students will develop a theoretical basis and use it to explore new forms, behaviors, interactions, algorithms and problems, new interaction paradigms built on those, and the construction of new sorts of applications.  The PI's BITPICT paradigm will serve as a vehicle for some of this work, which is expected to have application to a wide variety of domains including interactive image analysis, robot motion planning, interactive weather or physics simulation, new analysis techniques for 2D simulation results, less-crisp representations for early-stage design, and new sorts of games.  If successful, the principal broad impact of this work will be the expansion of the range and variety of interactions that humans will have with computers, in work and play settings, which in turn may possibly encourage us to think about new types of problems.  More speculatively, the development of the underlying graphical computation theory could enable new sorts of theories of how human spatial processing might work, and also provide a new understanding of fundamental computational aspects of space and spatial representations, as well as limits on spatial abstraction.\r\nhttp://www.si.umich.edu/ComPix\r\n",
