Support is requested for senior year student engineers to provide approximately six prototype \"custom designed\" devices and software per year to aid persons with disabilities.  The primary goal of this thrust is to provide a meaningful design experience for the engineering student that will directly aid a specific disabled individual.  The formal program in place at Wright State University and the record of accomplishments already established by the Principal Investigator will ensure satisfactory progress on these projects.\r\n\r\nThirty projects are anticipated during the five duration of this award, and a written report about the completed projects will be submitted for an annual publication.  A group of students and the investigators on the grant will work with collaborating agencies and individuals on these projects.  When completed, the product from each project will be given to the person for whom it was designed.  The expectation is that this \"real world\" experience will give engineering students a sense of purpose and pride, help engineering schools serve the community, attract new students into engineering, and raise students interest in graduate education.\r\n\r\nThis type of undertaking is important since it provides a meaningful experience for engineering students to meet part of their undergraduate design requirements, and it also benefits a population where customization is often needed for assistive devices.\r\n",
