 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miles College\r\n\r\n\tThis proposal represents, a strategic plan to address the under representation of\r\nminorities in the science, mathematics engineering and technology (SMET) related\r\ndisciplines. The strategies proposed are intended to develop a systematic educational\r\ncontinuum from the undergraduate to the doctorate level.\r\n\tMiles College, located in Birmingham, Alabama, is one of the nation's\r\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities (MCU). It was founded in 1905 under the\r\naegis of the Christian Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church, and receives continuing\r\nsupport from that body. It had a spring 1998 enrollment in excess of 1400 students, the\r\nlargest enrollment in recent history.\r\n\tTo accomplish the initial goal of increasing the number of minority students\r\nenrolling at Miles, the faculty will assist in recruiting qualified students and revising the\r\nsupport system for said students. There will be an increased focus in developing research\r\nopportunities for the college students with concomitant experiences for public school\r\nstudents. Monthly science seminars will be conducted at the College. Students and\r\nselected faculty will mobilize themselves and deliver parallel points of interest in the\r\npublic school setting as part of the recruitment effort of qualified students. Selected\r\npublic school students will intern in the summer on the Miles College campus for greater\r\ninvolvement in research.\r\n\tThe research interest must produce the kinds of results that will maintain student\r\ninterest and will foster community for our programs. As this interest grows, the ability to\r\nattract private and public partners will increase concomitantly. The private partners will\r\nhelp in creating internships and cooperative learning experiences for Miles College\r\nstudents. The research commitment is already developing and private partners have\r\nindicated that they will begin to make arrangements to accommodate the interns from\r\nMiles.\r\n\tFaculty development will be manifest in multiple facets: recruitment of\r\nresearchers interested in teaching and training, continuing education and retraining for\r\nseasoned professionals, current faculty will sharpen their skills by conducting in-service\r\nfor peers and students and there will be emphasis for junior faculty to earn advanced\r\ndegrees. These efforts will harness the type of faculty that will set Miles College on the\r\ntrack to achieve the scientific prominence that attains the renown of its sister colleges in\r\nthe area and beyond.\r\n",
