Kukreti\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests support for initiating nine undergraduate students in research in Structural Engineering each year for five years.  At least three positions will be filled by minorities or women, which will include at least one Native American.  Persons with disabilities will be accommodated.  Engaging the REU participants in discovery through actual construction, experimental testing, observing and recording, synthesizing the data collected and generalizations will provide the research experience.  Three laboratory projects have been identified for each year in the following areas: the design of improved micro-concrete and measurement of the bond strength of model reinforcing bars, manufacture and testing of small-scale steel frame connections, and construction and testing of a small-scale steel frame fitted with various types of seismic bracing and base isolation systems.  The students selected will be divided into three groups, and each group will study one project during the two summer months (June and July).  All three projects are so chosen to build on previous year's REU project, and will improve the capabilities of small-scale models used to investigate the seismic performance of structural systems.  Each year the groups will produce detailed technical reports and present their findings to a panel of judges consisting of three professional civil engineers and two professors from visual arts and video media.  The judges will select the \"Best Project\" in both the technical and visual presentation categories.  Upon returning to their home institutions, the participants will prepare papers for presentation at the student paper competitions and seminars.\r\n",
