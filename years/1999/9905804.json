 "awd_abstract_narration": "The US-Japan Cooperative Earthquake Research on Composite and Hybrid Structures NSF 94-154 is currently in its final states.  The research program was aimed at obtaining much needed basic information to understand the behavior and to develop practical design recommendations and procedures for composite and hybrid structures.  Therefore, which was constrated so far on component and subassemblage studies.  The research program has produced a wealth of useful engineering information.  However, testing work on full structural systems, which is critical for completing the joint research initiative has not been undertaken.  \r\n\r\nThis project follows the recommendation of the last annual meeting (October 1998) of the Joint Technical Coordination Committee, which strongly urged a careful planning effort for the full-scale testing.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to carry out the planning work on the US side (in parallel with similar work on the Japanese side) for the US-Japan cooperative research program on full structural system testing and related studies.  The planning effort will span over a period of 12 months, covering (1) holding two meeting of the US planning group and (2) holding a joint US-Japan Planning workshop in order to finalize detailed recommendations and plans for the program.\r\n",
