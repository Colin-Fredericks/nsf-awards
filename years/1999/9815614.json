The abundance of labrids makes them an integral part of the ecology of reef systems as well as an important economic resource.  Although the biology of labrids has been the subject of intensive research, little is known about their ancestor-descendant relationships.  This proposal requests support for a study of the historical relationships among the Labridae using both structural and molecular characters.  The central objectives of this study are (1) to resolve relationships among major groups of fishes in the family Labridae; and (2) to integrate patterns of relatedness among species with information on locomotor and feeding mechanisms.\r\n\tThis study focuses on anatomical study of new fish species and anatomical regions. The sequence of nucleotides in DNA is a popular and now easily obtained set of characters that can be used for genealogical analysis, and complete sequence data from the genes cytochrome b and 12S rRNA will be obtained. This project will provide a comparison of anatomical and molecular data for a theory of species relationships using multiple data sets.\r\n\tThis research will use the phylogeny of the Labridae to understand major features of the feeding and locomotor systems of these fishes. The biodiversity found within this group is reflected in their exploitation of a wide range of feeding and locomotor behaviors.  The structure and function of the jaws in labrids mirrors the ecological diversity of feeding on many types of prey.  Locomotion is accomplished by using the pectoral fins to row or fly through the water with a wide range of fin structures and swimming performance. Phylogenetic studies proposed here provide the framework for interpretation of function and ecology in one of the largest, most diverse fish families in the world.\r\n\tThis project is significant to the field of biology due to its contribution of new phylogenetic information on a large group of important fishes.  The research provides a starting point for the study of genealogy among more than 10% of living fishes. Of broader significance is the use of phylogenetic trees to interpret patterns of change in structural and functional characters.  The movement toward an integrated understanding of biological structure and function, from tissues to whole organisms, is one of the major frontiers of biology. This work contributes to that goal by providing a phylogenetic framework for studies of labrid ecology, biomechanics, behavior, and evolution.  Finally, this study makes a significant educational contribution as it involves students in research at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.\r\n",
