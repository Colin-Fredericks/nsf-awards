 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:  Genetic models of speciation by reinforcement\r\nPrincipal investigator:  Mark Kirkpatrick\r\n\r\n\tMost species remain distinct from one another simply because they avoid interbreeding.  A major theory for the evolution of this reproductive isolation is the \"reinforcement\" hypothesis, which holds that mating preferences evolve to decrease the chance of producing unfit hybrid offspring.  As a result, reproductive isolation evolves and speciation occurs.  This hypothesis is controversial because it is unclear whether isolation can evolve in the face of the genetic introgression that accompanies hybridization.\r\n\tThis project will develop a comprehensive picture of how, when, and why speciation by reinforcement can operate.  The approach is to develop mathematical models that describe the evolution of genes for mating preferences and other isolating mechanisms.  The research will investigate how three key factors influence the process:  the mechanism that prevents interbreeding (e.g. mating preferences, habitat preferences, flowering time differences, etc.), the genetic factors that make hybrids less fit, and the geography of parental populations (e.g. whether they are contiguous or completely overlapping).  Results will make qualitative predictions about where we can expect to find speciation by reinforcement, and offer quantitative predictions that can be tested directly against data from natural populations.  Novel mathematical methods will be developed that hold promise for use in a wide variety of other problems in evolutionary genetics.\r\n\tModern evolutionary biology has a quite comprehensive understanding of how genes evolve within populations, but a relatively poor understanding of how one population splits into two.  This research will illuminate the mechanisms of speciation, providing insights into the fundamental processes that regulate biodiversity on earth.\r\n\r\n",
