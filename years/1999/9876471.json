He will work on Aubin's conjecture, that the Euclidean\r\nisoperimetric inequality continues to hold in a simply connected\r\nspace of nonpositive curvature, at least for small volumes. More\r\ngeneral isoperimetric problems in Euclidean space involve\r\nclusters of several given volumes, crystalline energies dependent\r\non direction, and immiscible fluids, for which interface cost\r\ndepends on the fluids separated. He will work on the Double\r\nBubble Conjecture for general volumes and in higher dimensions. A\r\ndistinguishing feature of many of these problems is the\r\nappearance of singularities.\r\n\r\nIsoperimetric problems consider the cost of enclosing volume:\r\nsoap bubbles enclosing volumes of air, crystalline arrangements\r\nof molecules in materials, the interplay between area and volume\r\nin the curvature of the universe.  Singularities often play a\r\ncritical role: soap films meeting in threes, structural defects\r\nin materials, black holes in the universe. Fundamental questions\r\nremain open. The Double Bubble Conjecture, for example, says that\r\nthe familiar double soap bubble is the least-area way to enclose\r\nand separate two given volumes of air. The recent computer proof\r\nfor the case of equal volumes by Hass and Schlafly can be traced\r\nback to work by Morgan's NSF undergraduate research Geometry\r\nGroup, which will continue to work on the general problem. Morgan\r\ngives some forty talks a year. To popular audiences he likes to\r\nexplain that the way to understand the geometry of the universe\r\nis first to understand the geometry of soap bubbles. He has a\r\nMath Chat TV show and column, both available at the Mathematical\r\nAssociation of America website at http://www.maa.org, and is\r\ncurrently making final preparations for the publication of a\r\npopular Math Chat Book.\r\n",
