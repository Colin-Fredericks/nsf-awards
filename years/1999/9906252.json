 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project will contribute to an understanding of the development of a new line of inquiry within the social and behavioral sciences in the post-World War II period. It will trace a set of ideas and practices known as group relations training from its inception within World War II military research, through university disciplines, and into industrial organizations in the United States. The goal of this project is to document the conceptualization and institutionalization of these ideas and practices as they circulated through various social and behavioral scientific communities of expertise over the last five decades. This will be accomplished through an examination of the institutional links and professional networks, as well as the research and practices of leading group relations trainers. The methods to be employed include archival research, collection of published and unpublished primary materials, oral history interviews, and participant-observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
