 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThe World Wide Web is undergoing a revolutionary transformation from static text-and-pictures hypertext to a more dynamic and interactive medium. A central part of this revolution is the development of component-style software, where many simpler units are created rather than fewer, more complex, and isolated applications. Mathematics, science and technology education researchers and developers around the world have flocked to \"Web/component\" software. However, the revolution is flying blind. Without adequate understanding of the educational implications of different models within this paradigm: (1) Too much work is being devoted to educationally suboptimal models of development and use. (2) Promising alternative models are not being developed or are being ignored. The proposed work will define and investigate a range of models of Web/component software.\r\n\r\nWe will empirically investigate existing models in the field. Empirical study will be at two levels. We will conduct a survey of existing models of Web/component software available on the Web (Level one). Teachers will be co-analysts of this available software. At Level two, we will conduct case studies of a number of different models by talking to and observing teachers (and, to a lesser extent, developers) in action while they attempt to use component software. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we will identify underlying educational issues as related to properties of Web/component models. For example, in terms of technology, we will investigate how the ease and flexibility of interconnection and the availability of rich resources in the container application affect the quality and educational productivity of Web/component software. In terms of development, we will investigate the effect of the development community (e.g., whether it includes teachers as first-class members) and pattern of development (e.g., many or few revision cycles). In terms of educational use, we will investigate different modes of teachers' learning about components, the pragmatics of setup and use, and the level of engagement of students.\r\n\r\nThe project aims to provide critical guidance concerning more or less productive models of development and use of Web/component software to future researchers, developers, practitioners and policy specialists in mathematics, science and technology education. In addition to science and mathematics, a small proportion of the project effort will be devoted to exploratory study of Web/components for much younger children, in reading and writing.\r\n",
