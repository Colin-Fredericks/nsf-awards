The work will be accomplished in collaboration with Dr. Hans Jannasch at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), who has developed a prototye of the instrument known as the OsmoSampler.  The OsmoSampler uses the osmotic pressure that is created across a semi-permeable membrane by solutions of differing salinity to draw water into a sample tube. The current instrument has experienced problems when used in hydrothermal environments with preservation of samples and biofouling.  The PI's plan to test various types of inlet systems and acidification schemes in prototypes that will be deployed at several vent sites for extended periods of time. Deployments and retrievals will be piggybacked on existing programs and will not require NSF-funded shiptime.\r\n",
