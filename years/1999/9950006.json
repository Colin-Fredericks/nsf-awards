 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will combine the resources of a major international center for quantum optics and technology with a successful collaboration of two-year college faculty members who have developed and administered an effective national faculty development program for two-year college physics faculty over the past eight years. The project will engage 40 two-year college faculty members employed in the academic preparation of science and engineering technicians throughout the US, in a two year long program of annual two week institutes and semi-annual academic year follow-up workshops. Participants will receive a combination of tutorials on recent discoveries in quantum optics, hands-on experience with the new tools of this recent technology in the laboratories of the research center and the pedagogical training in active learning techniques designed to maximize student understanding of the scientific principles which provide the foundation for these emerging technologies.",
