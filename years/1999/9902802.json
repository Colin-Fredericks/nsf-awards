 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n \r\nThe backbone infrastructure for the emerging broadband integrated services digital network (B-ISDN) will primarily employ optical fiber technologies due to the extremely high capacities of these channels. An attractive alternative, and in some cases companion, to optical fiber for giga-bit per second communications is radio frequency (RF) for line-of-sight wireless communication. Such channels, including both terrestrial and satellite, have many potential advantages over optical fiber counterparts. They can be deployed over a wide range of geographical areas; are flexible and can easily be expanded; allow rapid deployment in remote environments including military, disaster relief, and emergency medical applications; and finally, can act as a back-up for optical fiber-based networks. While \"high-integration\" implies single-chip solutions in applications where silicon technologies can meet system speed requirements, \"high-integration\" in electronics for giga-bit communication systems means the minimization of total chip and component count; i.e., a result minimizing overall board space. Typically, more than one integrated circuit (IC) technology will be involved. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research involves the investigation of signal processing partitioning and the development of integrated circuits utilizing various IC technologies including InP, GaAs, and silicon to implement highly-integrated portable modems for giga-bit per second throughput over wireless RF terrestrial and satellite channels. A focus of this research is the development of circuit approaches to implement the IF-to-baseband processing in the analog domain. An analog solution can potentially result in a much lower power consumption than a digital implementation. BPSK and QPSK receiver structures will be examined and methods \r\nto maximize integration and minimize power consumption will be studied. An end goal of this research is to develop a working prototype link including RF, IF, baseband, and error control functions with a throughput on the order of a giga-bit per second and a bit-error rate (BER) on the order of 10E-12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
