 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe goal of this project is to sequence the genome of Halobacterium, an extremely halophilic Archaeon, in its entirety and initiate functional genomic studies. The genome of Halobacterium NRC-1 contains a stable 2.0 Mbp circular chromosome and two large unstable plasmids, pNRC100 and pNRC200, 191 kb and 300 kb, respectively. The justification for this project is:  (a) Halobacterium represents one of the best model Archaeal systems, with well-developed genetic methodologies such as genetic transformation and gene replacement and overexpression;  (b) Halobacterium represents a major physiological type (extreme halophile) of the Archaea;  (c) Halobacterium has many unique and unusual biochemical and cellular characteristics, including the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, other retinal proteins, and salt-loving enzymes, etc.;  (d) Halobacterium has a genome that is the smallest among halophiles and has been extensively characterized by mapping and sequencing;  (e) Halobacterium has a genuine potential for biotechnology, for example in bioengineering of unusual characteristics for special applications (such as bacteriorhodopsin films for biological computers and programmed cell flotation for bioremediation), and as a host for production\r\nof novel biological products (such as biodegradable plastics and recombinant proteins and enzymes); and  (f) Halobacterium exhibits salt tolerance that may be genetically transferable to crop plants. The majority of the DNA sequencing work will be conducted in the Hood lab at the University of Washington while most of the computational analysis of the sequence and functional genomics will be conducted in the DasSarma laboratory.  Resources will be shared between the two groups and the DNA sequence will be released to the scientific community, ensuring a dynamic project with significant long-term scientific impact.\r\n",
