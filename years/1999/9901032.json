The focus of the meeting will be on evaluating the extent to which laboratory data can be used to interpret the spectroscopic thermal emission properties of dust in the interstellar, protostellar and circumstellar environments and also in solid body surface regoliths.  The talks will be organized along four parallel themes:\r\n\r\n1. What are the limitations of using laboratory reflectance spectra to interpret the thermal emission properties of  solid particles in space?\r\n2. To what extent do the thermal emission spectra of stellar disks support the notion that the emitting particles share physical properties with the regoliths of astronomical bodies?\r\n3. Under what conditions is a spherical approximation for such particles valid?\r\n4. What are the uncertainties in the measured optical constants?\r\n\r\n\tA number of internationally recognized experts will present invited discourses on various topics related to the use of rotational and vibrational emission spectra as diagnostic tools for studying astronomical dust particles ranging in size from 5-50mm.  The Astronomical Society of the Pacific has agreed to publish the  proceedings of this meeting, so that the results will be broadly available to the astronomical community.\r\n\r\n\tFunds are requested for partial subsidy of the publication expenses of the proceedings and travel support for two invited scientists from the Ukraine.  \r\n\r\n",
