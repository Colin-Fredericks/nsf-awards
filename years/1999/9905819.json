An early attempt to rationalize phonology in terms of a combined articulatory/auditory model (e.g. Jakobson, Fant, & Halle, 1951) was spurred by technological advances in instrumental phonetics - particularly the development of the sound spectrograph - but failed because the intellectual base needed for the correct evaluation of acoustic phonetic cues was not sufficiently well developed. The intervening years have seen further advances in technology and a dramatic expansion of the base of knowledge regarding processes of speech perception. These developments lead naturally to a reappraisal and reconsideration of the role of perceptual phenomena in phonology, which is currently flourishing in several research centers in the US and abroad.\r\n\r\nConcurrent with these developments in speech perception research are developments in phonological theory which open the way to incorporation of perceptual properties or processes in the formal statement of phonology. In particular, the trend to adopt harmonic constraint interaction models of phonology, such as optimality theory and correspondence theory, has led to a renewed interest in both articulatory processes and perceptual processes which underlie violable constraints in these models.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this grant is to hold a satellite meeting in conjunction with the XIVth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences (San Francisco, CA, Aug.1-7, 1999). The satellite meeting aims to provide an interface between speech perception researchers and phonology researchers, and will consist of invited papers by key researchers in each of these fields, in addition to a poster session. The specific goals of the meeting are to identify classes of perceptual properties which may offer promising insights into phonological structure and classes of phonological models which can capture language universal and language specific auditory/perceptual generalizations. An edited, peer-reviewed collection of the papers will also be produced by the PIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
