 "awd_abstract_narration": "Andrew Marcus is supported by a CAREER award from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental studies of the properties of complex materials confined to spatially restricted geometries such as polymer, colloid or biomolecular membrane systems in thin films or membrane form.  Marcus will pursue three interrelated lines of investigation: 1) the study of structure and dynamics of these systems; 2) the development of highly sensitive instrumental techniques specialized in the detection of optical signals from volumes that are very small or narrow; and 3) the extension of these techniques towards the study of the properties of biologically relevant systems such as membrane bound proteins.  Marcus' teaching plan at the undergraduate level will broaden the content of honors freshman chemistry by developing multidisciplinary themes and using cognitive learning processes that actively engage students through participation.   At the graduate level he will broaden the graduate education and research activities through involvement in multidisciplinary research projects.\r\n\r\nThe complexity of supermolecular systems holds promise to a rich array of behaviors useful in the area of nanotechnology.  At the present time, however, there is insufficient understanding of the properties of liquids, simple or complex, in confined spaces.  Marcus' research will attempt to extend this understanding and shed light on the properties of such systems.\r\n",
