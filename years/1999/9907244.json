 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geological and geophysical observations indicate that serpentinites (rocks from the earth's mantle that are metamorphosed under hydrous conditions near the earth's surface) are an important component of the oceanic lithosphere at slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges. The primary goal of this project is to provide experimental data on the rheological properties of serpentinites and to provide constraints on the conditions at which serpentinization of mantle peridotite initiates.  In particular we propose to: (1) Conduct experiments on non-serpentinized peridotites to investigate the process of thermal cracking.  These experiments are designed to investigate mechanisms by which fluids can penetrate into the lithosphere to promote serpentinization; (2) determine the range of conditions over which the unique style of brittle deformation exhibited by serpentinites occurs and how it influences the permeability of deforming aggregates; and (3) investigate the effect of temperature on the strength, deformation mechanisms and permeability of serpentinites and serpentine-bearing fault gouge.  The results of these studies will provide fundamental constraints necessary for understanding the depth to which fluids can penetrate the cooling lithosphere and how the strength of the lithosphere evolves during serpentinization.  In addition, experimental constraints on the permeability and rheology of serpentinites under hydrothermal conditions will help quantify the potential weakness of serpentinized faults and therefore the extent to which strain localization in the mid-ocean ridge environment is influenced by serpentinization.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
