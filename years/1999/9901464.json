The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Robert H. Manson to work with Dr. Guadalupe Williams-Linera at the Instituto de Ecologia in Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico.  Twelve months of this project are being supported by NSF's U.S.-Mexico Program.\r\nDr. Manson will examine the consequences of habitat fragmentation for the maintenance of biological diversity in threatened Mexican cloud forests.  He will investigate how fragmentation may reduce the long-term viability of vertebrate communities in remnant patches of cloud forest and limit the ability of these forests to regenerate.  He will do this by addressing two questions: 1)How does the activity and abundance of cloud forest vertebrates change along vegetation gradients from patch interiors into habitats surrounding forest fragments? and; How do the responses of herbivores to forest-field edges influence cloud forest regeneration in disturbed areas surrounding forest fragments?\r\n\r\nDr. Williams-Linera has conducted extensive studies on cloud forest vegetation and has been awarded a long-term European Community grant that will channel funds to support parallel herbivory studies in disturbed areas surrounding Chilean forests.  The Instituto de Ecologia is devoted primarily to the generation and dissemination of knowledge relevant to the use and conservation of natural resources and biodiversity in Mexico.  It has over 140 scientists working in the areas of ecology, biosystematics and animal behavior. In addition, it houses the most important herbarium on the flora of Veracruz that will be crucial in the identification of plant species relevant to this project.\r\n***\r\n",
