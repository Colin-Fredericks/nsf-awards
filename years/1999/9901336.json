The purpose of the conference is to encourage communication and the discussions to be conducted in an atmosphere conducive to open interactions between the scientists, provoking new and even speculative ideas for future research.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals requires the participation in all of the conference activities of a significant number of leaders in the field.  However, a science as rapidly developing as nuclear chemistry invites and needs cooperative efforts on all levels with a range of expertise for its growth.  Therefore, younger scientists from all countries are encouraged to participate in the conference and to present their ideas.  In particular, in anticipation of the future need of manpower and of a growing importance of international cooperative scientific ventures, it appears necessary to expose selected advanced graduate student from the major international research universities to the new opportunities and techniques in nuclear science.\r\n\r\n",
