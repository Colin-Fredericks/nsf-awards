Daniele Finotello of Kent State University will also contribute.  Their objectives are to 1) explore the fundamental physical chemical properties behind self assembled layers on surfaces for liquid crystal alignment and 2) establish ways in which the aligning layers can be modified and manipulated to influence the liquid crystal alignment directions.\r\n\r\nThe researchers intend to investigate the surface induced ordering for configurations with homeotropic boundary conditions by using magnetic resonance techniques to probe alignment layers and the liquid crystal.  This will permit direct investigation of the ordering of the alignment layer in both nematic and isotropic phase.  Their approach will be to selectively deuterate molecules useful in alignment layers and attach them to the walls of porous membranes possessing the appropriate surface-to-volume ratio for magnetic resonance experiments.  Additional microcalorimetry and optical techniques will be employed.  Results should improve our fundamental understanding of ordering in these systems and may be applicable in novel flat liquid crystal display devices.\r\n\r\nThis project in solid state chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence. \r\n",
