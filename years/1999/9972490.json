 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elman\r\n\r\nThis project concerns the development, analysis and testing of techniques\r\nof numerical linear and nonlinear algebra for solving systems of equations\r\narising from discretization of a collection of partial differential equations.\r\nThe emphasis will be on preconditioning strategies and their combination \r\nwith Krylov subspace iterative methods for linear and nonlinear systems.\r\nThese ideas will be applied to several examples of differential equations,\r\nprimarily coming from models of fluid dynamics.  Our focus will be on two \r\ntypes of problems, the saddle point problems produced by direct discretization \r\nof the primitive formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, \r\nand the convection-diffusion equation.  These have been chosen because they \r\nare used in numerous engineering models of fluid flow, and because they contain\r\nchallenging mathematical and computational qualities that make them difficult \r\nto solve.  In particular, accurate discretization in two and three dimensions \r\nleads to large sparse systems of algebraic equations that are nonsymmetric,\r\nand for the first problem, nonlinear and indefinite.  In addition, they have \r\nassociated with them fundamental parameters such as Reynolds numbers and \r\ndiscretization mesh widths that, for the solution of problems of practical \r\ninterest, cause many algorithms to converge slowly and require large-scale \r\nsystems to attain accuracy.  Our goals are to extend and analyze certain \r\npreconditioning techniques designed for saddle point problems.  Plans include \r\ndemonstration of the effectiveness of these preconditioners for general mixed \r\nfinite element discretizations, development of rigorous mathematical techniques\r\nfor analyzing convergence, demonstration of their usefulness in realistic \r\nsettings involving general meshes and domains, and incorporation of fast\r\nalgorithms for the convection-diffusion equation into the solution process.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of developing computational algorithms is to enable the \r\nefficient numerical solution of differential equations used in mathematical \r\nmodelling.  The use of such models is becoming an increasingly important\r\ncomponent in manufacturing and design (for example, of aerospace vehicles,\r\nautomobiles, cooling devices for nuclear devices) and in enhancing our\r\nunderstanding of critical natural phenomena (for example, blood flows and\r\ndispersal of environmental pollutants).  Understanding these phenomena\r\nthrough purely experimental techniques is prohibitively expensive or\r\nimpossible, whereas the use of mathematical models introduces a basic \r\nunderstanding of the physics by providing approximations to quantities\r\nsuch as flow rates and pressures.  This leads to the identification of \r\npromising design features, such as wing shape in airplane manufacturing.  \r\n(For example, many of the design decisions for the Boeing 777 jet were made \r\nusing computational studies.)  Accurate solution of the mathematical models \r\nis only feasible, however, if reliable and fast solution algorithms are \r\navailable.  The goal of this project is to develop such algorithms.\r\n\r\n",
