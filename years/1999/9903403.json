 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is intended to develop the ability to predict the burning behavior of pulverized coal and biomass. Both the reduction in char reactivity as a result of thermal annealing and the mode of char-particle burning are characterized.  A char combustion model that predicts particle burning rates and variations in size and density of chars is developed.  In the experimental effort, chars are injected into a flow reactor in which the gas temperature and oxygen concentration are controlled.  Partially reacted char samples are extracted from the reactor at various residence times and analyzed.  Properties determined include mass loss, particle size distribution, specific surface area, apparent and true densities and intrinsic chemical reactivities.  Size-classified coal and biomass chars and low-porosity and high-porosity synthetic chars are studied.  The model developed combines submodels for mode of burning, chemical kinetics, and surface-area evolution; this produces a comprehensive, reactivity-based char oxidation model that allows for reductions in reactivity in due to thermal annealing and for changes in apparent density and particle size.",
