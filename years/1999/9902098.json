 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDuring the evolutionary transition from egg-laying to live-bearing, several physical and physiological changes must occur to support the developing embryo. The placenta provides an interface between the mother and fetus, allowing life-sustaining transport of oxygen, nutrients, and wastes. Because the structure of the placenta also permits exchange of steroid hormones, species with relatively recently evolved placentation may face the additional challenge of regulating maternal and fetal hormone levels. Steroid hormones influence pregnancy maintenance and fetal development, so placental effects on these processes could have critical consequences. Study of the evolution of placental physiology in mammals has been limited, because the placenta of eutherian mammals has only one evolutionary origin. However, in reptiles, the placenta has evolved recently and independently as many as 100 times, making this an ideal group for comparative evolutionary study. This proposal aims to define hormonal mechanisms that accompany the evolution of the placenta, and their effects on fetal and maternal hormone levels. The PIs  recent work demonstrated that,  by reducing the levels of some hormones, the placenta of the mountain spiny lizard may contribute to the isolation of the maternal and fetal hormonal environments. A series of three additional studies will identify placental steroid products, examine interactions between the placenta and fetal glands, and determine the placenta's role in mediation of maternal effects on fetal hormone levels. This comparative mechanistic approach promises to provide novel perspectives on the evolution of placental hormone function.\r\n",
