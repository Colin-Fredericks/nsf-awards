 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Interactive Spatial Science: Multimedia Geography Education\" brings together multimedia technology and the compelling collection of 52 video case studies and much additional video material produced in 35 countries around the world for the PBS telecourse \"The Power of Place: World Regional Geography.\"  The cases tell brief, often powerful, documentary stories about people whose lives have been shaped by particular highlighted geographical forces. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of planned contributions to teacher preparation in this project.  Also, a planned joint product is a set of materials for a new Advanced Placement high-school level course in geography.  Materials are being negotiated with the College Board's content advisors and designed to meet the recently approved standards for an AP Geography course.  The teacher preparation version of the materials is being developed jointly with Sarah Bednarz, professor of geography at Texas A&M University, in consultation with Osa Brand, Director of Education Affairs for the Association of American Geographers, and Ruth Shirey of Indiana University of Pennsylvania, the Executive Director of the National Council for Geographic Education.  \r\n\r\nThe project is implementing an advanced and novel approach to interactive multimedia design.  Faculty and students can interact with a set of high-quality telecourse video segments stored on CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs.  Control of those video segments, plus all other programming, text, and GIS maps come from the Cambridge Studios' World Wide Web server.  These materials are being produced in concert with geography faculty from over ten U.S. institutions, who are assisting with the development of new interactive versions of the materials. This hybrid approach solves the bandwidth problem of the Internet, which cannot quickly transmit truly high-quality videos.  At the same time, it also avoids the problem of obsolescence in traditional CD-ROMs.  The nonvideo materials can be improved at will and posted instantly over the Web. So can the decision about which video segments to use, since access to them is entirely Web based.\r\n\r\nAll non-video materials are handled in data bases associated with the Cambridge Studios' Web server, so the server has the ability to retrieve many sources of data for posting to multiple Web pages. This means that multiple versions of the same case study can be published for courses as varied as human geography and forest ecology.  Each instructor who uses these materials can customize the text and user interface, send the changes back to the central server, and receive a new version that can be published quickly.   \r\n\r\n",
