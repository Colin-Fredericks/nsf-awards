 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  Show-Me Lectures  is a series of\r\nmeetings   in  mathematical analysis\r\norganized by the following four institutions:\r\nthe University of Missouri-Columbia,\r\nthe University of Missouri-St. Louis,\r\nthe University of Missouri-Rolla,     and\r\nWashington University in St. Louis.\r\nSeveral lectures  have been delivered in previous \r\nShow-Me meetings  on many topics of Analysis,  \r\nsuch as analysis on groups, Banach space theory, \r\ndifferential equations, harmonic analysis,   \r\nand probability theory. These lectures were  \r\npresented by prominent mathematicians from all \r\nover the world. Attendance was not restricted to \r\nspecialists from one field or another but was amimed at a\r\ngeneral audience  who wanted to learn more about \r\nanother area and explore possible connections \r\nwith theirs. Such connections have  certainly \r\nappeared in many instances and in several occasions \r\nhave led to fruitful discussions and collaborations. \r\nMany quality collaborations have been accomplished \r\nas a result of these meetings and several more have\r\nbeen initiated. It is our belief that these collaborations\r\nbenefit not only the researchers involved but also strengthen \r\nand unify the field of mathematical analysis as an entity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMathematical analysis can be viewed as the part of\r\nmathematics whose primary roots lie in calculus.  \r\nIts principal concepts are derivatives and integrals, \r\nwhich appear in a multitude of different settings.\r\nMathematical  analysis provides the foundation for applied mathematics, \r\nphysics, astronomy and other areas, and is one of the more dynamic, \r\nviable, and  applicable  areas of mathematics today.\r\nAmong the many subspecialties of analysis of importance \r\nto science and pure mathematics, one may cite the theory\r\nof integral transforms, which plays a major role in tomography, the theory of \r\nwavelets, which in recent years has revolutionized the study of signal \r\nprocessing, and the theory of Banach spaces, in which mathematicians have\r\nconstructed a richly endowed universe with infinitely many dimensions.\r\nRecent Showme seminars have included principal lectures on each of these\r\nsubjects, and on numerous other topics in analysis, by distinguished\r\nmathematicians, some from  various of our four universities in Missouri\r\nand some from further afield. The primary objective of the Showme  meetings \r\nis to stimulate, promote, and enhance interaction \r\nbetween the different groups of mathematical analysis.\r\nIn addition to the stimulating lectures, these meetings \r\nare providing splendid opportunites for the analysts in Missouri and \r\nnearby states to learn about each other's work and to initiate\r\ncollaborations. We anticipate many more fruitful seminars in times to\r\ncome.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
