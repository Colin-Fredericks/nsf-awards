 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Robert Hoffman, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at New Mexico State University, studies the use of amino ketones in the stereoselective synthesis of densely functionalized compounds.  Using protected alpha-amino ketones in which the protecting group is chosen to exert either steric or electronic control, 1,2- and 1,3-stereocontrol is obtained in the introduction of chiral centers downstream from the amino group.  This strategy affords access to complete stereoisomeric families of 1,2-difunctional, 1,2,3-trifunctional, and 1,2,3,4-tetrafunctional compounds.  Through the application of this general strategy to the steric and chelation controlled reduction of protected amino ketones and analogous 1,3-stereocontrol in the electrophilic functionalization of enol derivatives of amino ketones, Professor Hoffman is developing procedures for the synthesis of amino sugars, phytosphingosines, azasugars, and monofluorinated peptide isosteres.\r\n\r\nMany of the organic compounds which have been discovered to display important biological properties contain a rather dense array of functional groups.  The development of methods for the preparation of such compounds, particularly with good control over the relative geometries of each of the carbon atoms bearing the functional groups, represents an ongoing challenge for synthetic chemists.  With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Robert Hoffman, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at New Mexico State University, is developing synthetic methodology for the preparation of densely functionalized compounds.  Starting from comparatively simple precursors, amino ketones, Professor Hoffman introduces groups which simultaneously protect the functionality of the amino ketone from undesirable reactions and control the outcome of desired reactions.  This efficient protocol affords access to a number of important classes of compounds.",
