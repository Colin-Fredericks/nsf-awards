Ion implantation is used to dope polycrystalline BSTO thin films.  Structural characterization of the implanted films is done by using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.  Doping profiles will be simulated with the program TRansport of Ions in Matter and the implanted profiles characterized by secondary ion mass spectroscopy.  The effects of ion site substitution in the AB03 perovskite lattice is studied.  A comprehensive investigation into the electrical properties of donor and acceptor doped BSTO thin films is carried out with an emphasis on interface vs bulk doping effects.  Electrical properties to be characterized include leakage, dielectric relaxation, capacitance density, dielectric loss, resistance degradation, microwave capacitance, and C-V.  In addition to donor and acceptor dopants, isovalent dopants are also investigated.  Ion implantation could be used to adjust the Ti concentration in BSTO thin films.  Different capacitor structures are designed, fabricated, and tested for the DRAM specifications.  This project is expected to help not only in the understanding of the implant doping effects of perovskite oxide films, but also in the development advanced planar memory devices for the next generation microelectronics.\r\n***\r\n",
