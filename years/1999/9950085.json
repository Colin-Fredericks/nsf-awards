 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project embraces and encompasses existing and emerging network technologies  beneficial to two-year college, secondary education, four-year colleges, and university environments. In this project a \"beneficial technology\" is defined as one that enables the student to successfully enter and keep pace with the current and future network technology workforce trends and that prepares the educator to enter the classroom and laboratory settings prepared to be the future education workforce and to teach the future workforce. The network technologies considered as emerging or future technologies have the following characteristics: (1) the education entities (secondary, two-year college, universities) targeted in this project lack sufficient knowledge of and experience in the technology, or (2) a current technology is in a constant state of change, thereby affecting information technology education and training within the education entities, or (3) new technologies that are on the \"leading edge.\" Technologies that are being targeted as emerging technologies in this project are Client/Server, Internet/Intranet, and Multimedia utilizing computer networks. The mission of the project are being accomplished by the following goals and objectives: \r\n\r\nGoal I.      Identify and evaluate emerging network technology trends, applications, innovations, and curricula.\r\nGoal II.\tDisseminate to educators and their students emerging network technology trends, applications, innovations, and curricula. \r\n Goal III.\tDevelop career education information and strategies to strongly promote interest by secondary and post-secondary students in computer network technology careers and the mathematics and sciences necessary for success in these careers.  \r\nGoal IV.\t Ensure the participation by females and minorities in all career education components of the proposed Center thereby increasing their participation in the degree components.  \r\nGoal V.\tProvide for the continued educational competency of secondary and post-secondary faculties and administrators who teach, implement, or administer curricula in emerging network technologies.  \r\nGoal VI.\tEstablish and facilitate an infrastructure to provide teacher internships and student work-based learning opportunities in emerging network technologies.  \r\nGoal VII.\tEstablish and facilitate an infrastructure to build a network of education,  government and business entities that will support the development of quality programs that educate not only the future information technology workforce, but re-educates the present information technology workforce.\r\n",
