The Gordon Research Conferences have a long history of being excellent venues for the communication and interchange of ideas in various scientific subject fields.  This conference is no exception to this rule.  A broad, interdisciplinary outlook characterizes this conference.  Nine sessions are devoted to Quantum Phase Transitions, Electrons in Confined Systems, Self-Assembled Devices, Classical Phase Transitions, Vortex Matter in Type-II Superconductors, Jamming Self-Assembly in Complex and Biological Systems.  The various topics of these sessions are linked by an underlying unity in that new theoretical, experimental, and simulation techniques are common to them and that similar principle guide the evolution from the microscopic to macroscopic processes in all the graduate students participate in these conferences, participation in which is limited in number to enable close interactions communications by the participants.\r\n\r\nThis award is for support of the 1999 Gordon Research Conference on condensed Matter Physics.  The Gordon Research Conferences have a long history of being excellent venues for the communication and interchange of ideas a various scientific subject fields.  This conference is no exception to this rule.  The  whole field of Condensed Matter Physics is a rapidly developing one, and a meeting in the setting offered by the Gordon Conferences is ideally suited for the participants to review the present state of the field, as well as to do their best to provide guidance for future advancements in theory, experiment and technology.  A broad, interdisciplinary outlook characterizes this conference.  There are nine themes that, although seemingly unrelated, are joined by an underlying unity in that similar principles guide the evolution from the microscopic to macroscopic processed in all these systems.  Established investigators, post doctoral research associates and advanced graduate students take part in these conferences, participation in which is limited in number in order to permit close interaction and communication by the participants.\r\n\r\n",
