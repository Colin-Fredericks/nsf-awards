Germanium-silicon strained epitaxial layers have been the subject of intense research and have recently been applied to heterojunction bipolar transistors.  In addition, germanium-silicon layers have been used to fabricate heterostructure field effect transistors which might provide higher performance p-channel transistors for CMOS.  In both cases, the attainable performance improvement has been limited by the amount of germanium which can be incorporated while maintaining fully strained layers during subsequent processing.\r\n\r\nUniform germanium-silicon-carbon epitaxial layers will be grown by UHV/CVD and applied to novel device structures.  A buried-channel charge-coupled device (CCD) will be fabricated which can operate at lower temperatures than existing CCDS.  Such a CCD is potentially applicable to astronomical imaging.  In addition, it will facilitate studies of the transport in germanium-siliconcarbon epitaxial layers which will lead to improved understanding of heterostructure field effect transistors.  A crucial part of this project is the growth of epitaxial layers with low carbon concentration (=O.2 %) which nevertheless have improved thermal stability,\r\n\r\nThis project will also explore the growth and application of nonuniform channels.  When grown under the proper conditions undulated layers are formed and in the limit of high undulation amplitude isolated islands (or quantum dots) are formed.  Arrays of quantum dots can be used to perform logic functions in the quantum cellular automata (QCA) concept.  In one implementation of QCA logic, it is necessary to gate transport between the quantum dots.  Quantum dots with the appropriate size and spacing will be grown in the germanium-silicon-carbon system, which will then be used to explore gated transport between quantum dots.\r\n\r\nThis project will yield results of benefit to both silicon integrated circuit technology and also to more exotic and speculative devices.  Work on uniform germanium-silicon-carbon channels will improve the prospects for the use of heterostructure field effect transistors in CMOS and will also lead to improved understanding of the factors which limit carrier mobility.  Studies of gated transport between quantum dots will improve the prospects for advanced quantum cellular automata-based computing.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
