 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal public involvement is often seen as an effective means of informing decision-makers about public opinion and thus promoting policies that are responsive to the values and concerns  of stakeholders.  However, this process may be compromised by cultural differences and misunderstandings and by the use of power to dominate political discourse and suppress opposing views.  This dissertation research evaluates the effectiveness with which public involvement elicits public sentiment and explains how cultural and political dynamics serve as inhibitory mechanisms.  The research examines these issues in adjacent portions of northern Vermont and New Hampshire, a sub-region of the Northern Forest of New England and New York, where attempts to develop both regional and state-level land-use and economic policy over the past decade have relied heavily on public input for guidance.  Community decision-making theory is used to examine how certain issues are excluded from public debate through such techniques as the design of public process, the use of persuasive rhetoric and political lobbying, or direct intimidation and co-optation.  The research relies on a cognitive approach to culture analysis to describe how cultural variation among interest groups engenders misunderstanding and constrains the range of publicly acceptable solutions.  The research uses several types of qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews, key-informant interviews, archival research, and participant observation.  This project will help fill a major gap in our theoretical understanding of public involvement by developing a model that explains how culture and power inhibit the conveyance of public sentiment to decision-makers.  On a pragmatic level in the Northern Forest, it will also provide a detailed evaluation of public process and a description of specific inhibitory mechanisms, as well as an analysis of cultural and political variation across a key portion of the region.\r\n\r\n",
