 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will assist in upgrading the equipment component in the context to a 10-year modernization plan for FHL research support facilities and in particular a laboratory for marine molecular biology.  The equipment along with existing instruments, will be part of a new laboratory and will permit nucleotide sequencing at FHL.  Choice of the molecular biochemical focus, the new building and the equipment selected from a longer list, were by a process involving committee-led, open meetings and many potential users.\r\nForty-five others were polled by e-mail.  \r\n\r\nThe equipment will be especially helpful to developing fields of research in ecology, systematics, neurobiology, muscle physiology and bioluminescence.  The facility and its equipment will be coupled to a particularly rich biological diversity, and it is therefore hoped that new opportunities in presently unknown fields of inquiry will also develop.\r\n\r\nThe Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL) is a marine biological field station of\r\nThe University of Washington, located in the San Juan Islands at the junction of Juan de Fuca and Georgia Straits.  FHL was sited originally at this location in 1903 because there is an unusual biodiversity present.  This biological richness attracts scientists as students in widely divergent fields from national and international universities and research institutions who require field or laboratory resources for the conduct of their work/studies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
