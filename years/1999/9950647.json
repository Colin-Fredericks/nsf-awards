 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students majoring in biology usually get a good foundation in genetics and biochemistry but many fail to grasp the concept that many genes encode for protein products that regulate and are regulated by developmental events. To address this deficiency we will integrate a number of courses within the biology curriculum that will result in a research based system that win teach a genetic approach to developmental biology. This system will rely on the use of zebra fish as a model animal system and potato as a model plant system. Student's investigators will isolate and characterize genes from these organisms and these genes will then be used to develop undergraduate exercises that will examine the association of gene expression with different stages of development. Initial gene isolation experiments will be conducted in an undergraduate molecular biology course. The genes isolated will be both random clones and genes targeted to specific metabolic enzymes. These genes will then be used by students in animal and plant developmental biology courses as pedagogical tools for demonstrating the interaction of genes and development. Additional courses in biochemistry, protein structure and function, and histology will give students the opportunity to examine different aspects of the genes and gene products isolated. With this approach we intend to instill in undergraduate biology majors a sense of the scientific process by giving them ownership and input into the experimental process.",
