The study has three main objectives:  (1) how magnetic flux emerges from the solar interior and manifests itself as an active region;  (2) to determine which physical properties of active regions are most closely associated with flares, and  (3) to identify why those physical properties are associated with flares.  Previous work has suggested that a 'kink instability' is associated with so-called 'd-spot active regions' thought to be closely associated with flare activity.  Detailed magneto-hydrodyamic and radiative transport physics will be incorporated into new models of buoyant magnetic flux tubes.  Comparison of these models with high resolution observations will provide a strong test of the hypothesis that rising unstable flux tubes 'disconnect' from their magnetic roots and manifest the observed properties of d-spot active regions.  The results of this study are likely to be applicable to other cool stars that exhibit surface activity.\r\n\r\n",
