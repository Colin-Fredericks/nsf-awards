 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bradforth is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to use ultrafast spectroscopic methods to explore the role and magnitude of the solvent effect on chemical reaction dynamics in solution.  The following studies will be carried out: (1) electron photodetachment via transitions to charge transfer to solvent states (CTTS), and (2) solution photodissociation of neutral molecules for which the isolated molecule dynamics have been extensively characterized both experimentally and theoretically.   A newly developed < 50 femtosecond tunable light source in the photochemically important  245-350 nanometer region will allow benchmark chemical systems to be examined.  In addition, new graduate level courses that incorporate spectroscopy and molecular dynamics in the time domain will be developed. Outcomes from the research effort are expected to permit quantitative comparisons to theory, forming a basis for understanding the details of chemical reactions in solution. \r\n \r\nMuch important chemistry takes place in liquids. When chemical reactions occur in liquid solutions, the liquid that surrounds the reacting molecules can affect the reaction outcomes significantly.  In this project, solution chemistry will be examined on the timescales of atomic motion in molecules.  Results from this project will lead to new insights into how molecules react in water and other liquids. \r\n",
