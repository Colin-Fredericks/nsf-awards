However, the lack of practically efficient algorithms and software for this problem has so far hampered its actual applications in practice.  The proposed project will attempt to rectify this situation.  Firstly, we plan to develop and implement efficient, practical algorithms and portable library software for solving the problem.  The algorithms to be studied will be variants of infeasible primal-dual interior-point methods.  Secondly, we will utilize the resulting software to develop and implement algorithms for integer programs that have non-binary variables varying in wide ranges and are difficult to solve for conventional branch-and-bound techniques.\r\n\r\nGiven a polygon on the plane, what is the largest ellipse that can fit inside the polygon?  This question can be easily generalized from the two-dimensional space (the plane) to higher-dimensional spaces, resulting in the so-called maximum-volume ellipsoid problem.  In many cases, the amount of computing time required for solving this problem determines how fast we can solve more complicated problems in applications, for example, problems in manufacturing and managerial decision-making processes.  In this project, we will develop fast methods and build efficient computer code for solving the maximum-volume ellipsoid problem, and then apply the code to solving application problems.\r\n\r\n",
