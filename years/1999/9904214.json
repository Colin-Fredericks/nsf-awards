 "awd_abstract_narration": "School choice is one of the hottest topics in education.  It means giving parents the opportunity to choose the schools their children will attend.  Since it is not possible to assign each student to her top choice school, a central issue in school choice is the design of a student assignment mechanism.  By now several cities including Boston, Cambridge, Little Rock, San Jose, and Seattle have adopted school choice plans.  While each of these plans has its protocol and guidelines for the assignment of students, none of them has a rigorous procedure.  The lack of rigorous procedures offers opportunities to manipulation and results in appeals by parents who are unsatisfied by the school assignments of their children.  This project introduces a new class of indivisible goods allocation problems that model public school choice, proposes a mechanism for rigorously assigning students to schools, and analyzes it.  The project also studies the allocation of housing with existing tenants.   The main application is on-campus housing, although the model has other applications such as public housing, office space allocation, and parking space allocation.  Existing allocation mechanisms are shown to have serious shortcomings including inefficiency.  An alternative mechanism is shown to overcome these shortcomings. Additional properties of this mechanism are studied and experiments are conducted to test the theoretical results that compare the performances of this mechanism and a widely used common real-life mechanism.    Both of these projects deal with design and analysis of mechanisms for real-life indivisible goods allocation problems.",
