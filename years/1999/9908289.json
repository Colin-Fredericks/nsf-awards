 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore the potential of using supercritical (dense gas) carbon dioxide in the blending and compounding of advanced polymers and composites based on single and twin-screw extrusion processes. Carbon dioxide is an inexpensive, nontoxic, and unregulated solvent.  Not only can it replace liquid organic solvents in conventional processing operations but, due to the unique properties available in the supercritical state, it can lead to completely new manufacturing processes and products in the polymer and composite industry.    Since more than 50% of all commercial polymers are in the form of blends or compounds, perhaps the greatest impact on polymer processing can be achieved through advances in polymer-polymer blending and polymer-fiber/particle compounding.  Supercritical carbon dioxide is currently being used extensively in the food industry due to its benign nature.  The regulatory environment surrounding the chemical and plastic industries creates an opportunity to translate some of the successes of supercritical fluids to the polymer processing area.  \r\n\r\nExperiments will investigate the dissolution of supercritical carbon dioxide into various polymers to establish the affect upon glass transition temperature, melt viscosity, chain mobility, density, and surface tension.  These effects can be used to improve mixing, wettability, and molecular diffusion in polymer and composite processing.  To facilitate the transfer of fundamental research into application, the project includes several levels of industrial involvement ranging from new process concepts to extruder screw design. The researchers will work closely with the industrial advisory  group, including material suppliers and extruder makers, to develop techniques of using supercritical carbon dioxide to enhance polymer-polymer, polymer-fiber, and polymer-nanoparticle mixing in mechanical and reactive blending and compounding.\r\n",
