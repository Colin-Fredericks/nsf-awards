To accomplish this, model colloidal systems will first be synthesized by free-radical dispersion polymerization in water-based medium utilizing amphiphilic comb polymers as stabilizing agents.  The product of such a synthesis is a nearly monodisperse suspension of latex spheres, stabilized by the hydrophilic side chains of combs that become physically tethered to the latex particle surfaces.  By spreading a sub-monolayer of these spheres at the air-water interface of a Langmuir trough and compressing the surface, a signature of the force-distance profile between latex particles is recorded in the pressure-area isotherm.  As the particles are forced into close contact, the recorded pressure is governed by the interactions between pendant chains of the anchored combs.  Thus, molecular-level information of the grafted layer interactions is retrieved.  This \"compressed latex\" approach may be adapted to a 3-D solution cell that records osmotic pressure as a function of cell volume.  Guided by self-consistent mean-field model predictions, we will use this scheme to probe the influence of  relevant system parameters such as the size, dispersity, and glass transition of the latex particles, chemistry, length, and surface density of the stabilizer pendant chains, and solvent quality and temperature on particle-particle interactions.  The compressed latex studies will be complemented by studies using proven structural and surface characterization methods, such as dynamic light scattering, neutron scattering, neutron reflectivity, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, to support the interpretation of pressure-area or pressure-volume profiles.\r\n%%%\r\nResults from this investigation could have widespread impact from both a scientific and technological viewpoint.  First, this study will document a new, relatively simple and inexpensive method to measure forces between colloidal particles.  Although colloids are ubiquitous in nature and important to numerous industries, scientists have surprisingly little experimental capability at present to directly quantify colloidal forces.  How the structure and chemistry of polymer stabilizers influence colloidal interactions is a topic of great interest.  The proposed experiments will test recent theories on colloidal stabilization, and provide insights that might be directly applied to industrial processes where controlling colloidal particle aggregation is highly desirable, e.g., in wastewater treatment, oil recovery, drug delivery, coating and binding operations, etc.  Moreover, materials developed for this study, namely the amphiphilic comb polymers and the water-based latexes, could prove useful for a broad range of commercial applications where stable hydrophilic surfaces are sought to improve surface wettability to inks, paints and glues, improve biocompatibility, reduce biofouling, and eliminate static charge build-up.\r\n*** \r\n",
