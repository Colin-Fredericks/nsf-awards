 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study mathematical models for superconductivity and \r\nliquid crystals. These materials are described by models posed at a variety of length scales.\r\nThe intent of the research is to investigate the qualitative features of the solutions \r\nto these models, analyze the thresholds at which the models predict change in the materials' \r\nbasic characteristics (changes of phase) and investigate the connections between the \r\nsolutions of different models at different length scales. The methods to be employed are \r\nanalysis of partial differential equations, asymptotic methods, homogenization, \r\nand numerical simulation.\r\n\r\nSuperconductors are used in electronic sensing devices, magnets and power transmission.\r\nApplications for liquid crystals are visual displays and optical screens.\r\nThese are examples of materials for which their characteristic features (their phases) \r\ncan change dramatically if subjected to electro-magnetic fields or variations in temperature.\r\nThis phenomenon is a great asset (essentially as if one has two materials in the same location) \r\nbut it is also a difficult feature to control.The goal of the project is to add to the \r\nunderstanding of the behavior of the models and their interrelations so that these \r\nmaterials can be used more effectively.  This will be done by means of mathematical analysis \r\nof these models in general settings. \r\n\r\n",
