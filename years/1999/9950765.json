 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is fourfold: (1) to use stereomicroscopes, polarized light microscopes and digital image capturing equipment in chemistry, earth science and occupational safety and hygiene management majors at Millersville University; (2) to provide professional development for university faculty in the use of optical and polarized light microscopy in undergraduate teaching; (3) to enhance the interdisciplinary collaboration between several departments at Millersville University of Pennsylvania; and (4) to serve as a model program for the introduction of optical stereomicroscopy and polarized light microscopy as a part of analytical problem-solving in the chemistry curriculum. This project is a direct result of the collaboration with colleagues supported through several NSF grants in both course and curriculum development (NSF-DUE 92-54291 and 96-53252) and in laboratory instrumentation (NSF-DUE 9153695), as well as the PI's work on a current NSF-DUE grant (9752769). \r\n\r\nThis project establishes six (6) optical microscopy \"stations\", composed of a stereo microscope and a polarized light microscope with light sources, within new general chemistry lab facilities.  In addition, a color video camera, a Windows-based digital imaging system and an SVGA projector, is made available so that microscopic images can be both projected onto a classroom screen for teaching purposes, as well as digitized, captured and archived for inclusion in reports, publications and presentations by students and faculty.  Five (5) chemistry faculty are being trained in PLM and optical microscopy through this project, and as a result, optical microscopy and PLM are being introduced in the following chemistry courses: general chemistry; analytical chemistry; polymer chemistry; introductory and advanced inorganic chemistry; environmental chemistry; and a non-science majors course on chemistry and art. The microscopy lab is available for use by the earth science department in teaching geochemistry and mineralogy courses.  Faculty and students in the occupational safety and hygiene management program in the department of industry and technology have access to the equipment.\r\n\r\nThe impact of microscopy-based laboratory activities on student learning and conceptual understanding is being evaluated throughout the project in accordance with the model of Nurrenbern and Pickering, (J. Chem. Ed, 1987).  A materials package including laboratory experiments, demonstrations, equipment specifications, reference materials, and sources of training is being compiled and distributed. \r\n",
