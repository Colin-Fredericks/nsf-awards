 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Dr. Duane Bruley at UMBC.  The proposal describes a program to study a method called Immobilized Metal Affininty Chromatography (IMAC ) for extracting high molecular weight proteins from natural blood.  It has the potential for yielding a less expensive route for doing this than methods based upon the use of monoclonal antibodies as well as those exploiting rDNA technology.  The proteins to be extracted could be important in the treatment of many diseases including hemphilia A and deep vein thrombosis(DVT).   \r\nCurrent therapies for these conditions involve drugs with serious side-effects.  The PI has outlined a program for studying his technique for isolating protein C from both blood plasma supplied by the American Red Cross and transgenic swine milk supplied by Virginia Polytechnic Institute.",
