Hierarchies of person, animacy, definiteness, grammatical function, semantic role, etc. underlie grammatical asymmetries which are found both within particular languages, and in the cross-linguistic distribution of various grammatical phenomena. Although universal tendencies in the form of these hierarchies are discernible, this domain is characterized by a great deal of language-particular variation. A central problem then is how to integrate markedness hierarchies into morphosyntactic theory in a way that acknowledges what is universal and at the same time permits for a wide range of language-particular variation.\r\n\r\nThe variability of hierarchies -- both across and even within languages -- has impeded recognition in formal generative syntax of their explanatory importance as universals. While hierarchies have played a central role in functional and topological syntax, they have remained on the margins of formal description and theory. The emergence of Optimality Theory (OT), however, has introduced new ways of thinking about the relation between the universal and the language-specific, as well as a formal theory of markedness. In OT, all constraints are conceived as universal but violable, with language-particular difference the consequence of different rankings of universal constraints. These developments provide the opportunity to reconsider the role of markedness hierarchies in syntax and to build a bridge between the insights and results of functional/typological work on the one hand, and the explicit modeling techniques of formal grammar on the other. The goal of this collaborative project is to develop a fully explicit OT approach to markedness hierarchies in syntax, and to test it against both crosslinguistic typological research and language-internal studies of syntactic structures.\r\n\r\nThis project will study crosslinguistic and language-specific asymmetries along several dimensions of prominence, including person, animacy, definiteness, and obviation. These asymmetries manifest themselves in various subsystems of grammar. To be studied here are voice, direction (i.e. inverse systems), case marking, agreement, and pronominal inventories, focusing on the Mayan and Bantu languages for in-depth linguistic study. A comparative survey of Australian languages will also be undertaken in the subsystems of interest. In addition, the role of markedness hierarchies in pidginization will be examined. This broad empirical scope is demanded by the theoretical approach (for which a major empirical test is the generation of typologies by reranking), and made possible by the combined expertise of the principal investigators and their assistants.\r\n",
