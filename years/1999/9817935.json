 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis dissertation research project will examine the careers of three prominent American social scientists in the mid-twentieth century and their attempts to redesign human personality and human nature in an atmosphere of accelerated social change after the Second World War. Professional social science experienced unprecedented institutional growth during this period as a result of the increased need for human resource management in governmental, military, corporate, and educational institutions. As scientists were enlisted to help produce social technologies for a society struggling to adjust to new patterns of work, domestic life, and community, scientific representations of the individual underwent reassessment and modification. The tremendous expansion of science and technology during this period also catapulted individual scientists beyond the academy into new positions of social authority. This project focuses on the social theories of three such scientists and their contrasting visions of the individual as either an efficient automaton or a multidimensional whole. The cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, the behaviorist psychologist Burrhus F. Skinner, and the personality psychologist Gardner Murphy all made central contributions to American social science and the scientific construction of human personality in the twentieth century. Mead, Skinner, and Murphy each crafted a unique vision of humanity and applied it to their respective critiques of American culture and American science. Their social theories were shaped not only by scientific research and experimental methodology but also by the expectations of public constituencies that placed different demands on individuals and groups in American society. By examining the reciprocal exchange and appropriation of social scientific and popular images of the individual, this project will contribute to an emergent but growing canon in the history of science that addresses the cultural history of American social science.\r\n",
