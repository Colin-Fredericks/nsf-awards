 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hawaiian archipelago provides an outstanding natural laboratory for biogeographic research.  Its extreme isolation, traceable landscape history, and unique biota provide a framework for scientific inquiry into the fundamental processes that have shaped its biosphere, thereby providing insights into biogeographic processes that have occurred in numerous other locales.  The Hawaiian islands are particularly well suited to analyses of the complex interplay among physical, biological, and human systems, because all three sets of systems have undergone considerable change from prehistoric time to the present.  Although many facets of current biogeographic relationships have been studied extensively, far less attention has been given to the ways that changing geologic and climatic conditions have influenced the evolution of natural landscapes on the islands.  This doctoral dissertation research project will determine how geologic and climate changes during the Quaternary period in the Maui Nui complex have influenced their biota.  A GIS-based model will be developed to trace the timing, duration, and general character of the Maiu Nui complex dating back to the time that the four islands of Maui, Moloka'i, Lana'i, and Kaho'olawe were united as one big island.  This model will be enhanced with the addition of paeloclimatic data, the compilation of detailed biogeographic data regarding flora, and the synthesis of existing biogeographic studies of the fauna of Maiu Nui to facilitate comparison with distributional patterns on other islands.  Particular attention will be given to the influence that previous land bridges among the present islands may have had on endemism, biodiversity, and the biotic similarity of species assemblages.  This project will provide new insights into the complex natural history of this unique part of the Hawaiian islands.  As such, it will enhance biogeographic theory regarding the interplay of changing physical and biological systems, and it will facilitate conservation efforts aimed at preserving complex biological systems with numerous rare and endangered taxa.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.",
