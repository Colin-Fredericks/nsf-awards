 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr Kirk seeks to understand how a complete program for cellular differentiation is \r\nencoded in a genome, and how it is executed at the cellular and molecular \r\nlevels.  The model system being studied is Volvox carteri, a simple spherical \r\ngreen alga with a division of labor between 2,000 terminally differentiated \r\nsomatic cells that undergo programmed cell death (after having provided \r\nmotility), and 16 germ cells that are potentially immortal.  A key gene \r\nregulating this germ-soma division of labor is regA , which acts in somatic \r\ncells to block reproductive development.  The RegA protein has features of a \r\ntranscription factor, and many of its putative targets have been cloned, \r\nsequenced and shown to be nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins \r\n(\"NGECPs\").  He will test the hypothesis that RegA plays its key role in \r\ngerm-soma differentiation by acting in somatic cells as an active repressor of \r\nNGECPs, thereby preventing chloroplast biogenesis, growth, and reproduction.  He\r\nwill test the effects of inducible regA transgenes on transcription of these \r\nNGECPs in both Volvox gonidia and Chlamydomonas cells.  Then recombinant RegA \r\nand anti-RegA antibodies will be used to test for binding of RegA to upstream \r\nregulatory regions of its cloned putative target genes, and to immunoprecipitate\r\n(and subsequently clone DNA of) chromatin fragments that bind RegA.  The \r\nsignificance of such binding sites will be tested with reporter constructs.  \r\nProteins interacting with RegA will also be sought via a suppresser screen and a\r\nyeast two-hybrid analysis.\r\n\r\n",
