 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ever since the pioneering work of Charles Darwin, biologists have questioned the origin and maintenance of social behavior: why do individuals sacrifice their own reproductive success for the benefit of others?  Bee species that demonstrate both social and solitary behavior provide a unique system for studying the evolution of sociality in order to answer this basic question.  The PI will investigate the evolutionary history of Halictus rubicundus, a bee species that is social in areas of warm climate and solitary in areas of cold climate.  First, by examining the genetic relationships among social and solitary populations the PI hopes to determine whether there have been multiple origins of sociality in this species.  Second, the PI will rear social and solitary bees under reversed environmental conditions to determine the effect of climate on social behavior.  Finally, the PI will examine various aspects of the behavior of individuals from social and solitary populations in order to understand which characteristics are unique to a population, and which are shared among all members of the species. \r\n\r\nThis work addresses several long-standing, fundamental questions in evolutionary biology:  What role do environmental factors play in the evolution of social behavior?  What are the consequences of sociality on the geographic distribution of a species? And what are some of the characteristics of a population that permit the transitions between solitary and social behavior? \r\n",
