 "awd_abstract_narration": "9908656  Hao  This is an award to support conduct of a workshop to consider research needs for engineering design of processes and systems to manage sludges derived from the treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater.  Processing and management of sludges derived from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment processes have historically absorbed more than half of the total cost of managing these wastes to reduce their undesirable impact on environmental and public health.  The context of a workshop to consider research needs relating to sludge management relates to anticipated increases in production and changes in composition of sludges in response to enforcement of existing and new regulatory pressures.  Its product is expected to assist the Engineering Directorate's relating biocomplexity to environmental sustainability and assist in advancing the National Science Foundation's commitment to integration of research and education as articulated in its strategic plan.***",
