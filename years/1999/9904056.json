 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to learn the fundamental mechanisms that produce a change of hydraulic conductivity in soil when treated with surfactants and to develop a mathematical model that can be used by scientists and engineers to predict the magnitude and direction of hydraulic conductivity change upon treatment of a particular soil with a specific surfactant and dose.  The roles of clay content and type,  of surfactant type and concentration and of soil structure will be investigated in order to advance fundamental understanding and predictive capabilities applicable for any soil-surfactant system.  Two nonionic and one anionic surfactants will be examined in each of three phases.  The first two phases will focus on understanding the four identified mechanisms by which hydraulic conductivity is altered.  The first phase will investigate direct physical effects on fluid or soil media and induced secondary chemical reactions; the second phase will investigate the destruction of soil aggregate and production of fines, and surfactant-clay interactions.  The third phase is designed to examine combinations of variables in artificial soils to understand the interrelationships among the individual mechanisms and to assess the predictive abilities developed in the first two phases.  In addition, a primary goal of the third phase will be the development of a mathematical tool capable of describing the observations of the experimental work, from which predictive capabilities will be developed.  The proposed project has the potential of making significant contributions to the basic science and understanding of soil-surfactant interaction and to the application of that knowledge to real-world remediation projects.",
