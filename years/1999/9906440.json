Dynan\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\n     The recognition, processing, and repair of double strand DNA breaks is of fundamental importance in the maintenance of chromosomal integrity.  The heterodimeric Ku protein is one of the central players in the eukaryotic double strand break repair system.  Biochemical and genetic studies reveal that this binding is the first step in a DNA repair pathway that involves a number of other proteins.  In mammalian cells, these include a protein kinase catalytic subunit, a nuclease, a DNA ligase, various accessory proteins, and perhaps, additional proteins that have yet to be discovered. The overall goal of the project is to understand the Ku-dependent repair pathway at a mechanistic level.  The work focuses on biochemical experiments using purified proteins and defined DNA substrates.  The experimental strategy involves the development of a cell-free repair system, based on purified components, that mimics the behavior of the in vivo double strand break repair pathway.  To accomplish this, known proteins that are required for repair will be expressed, purified, and tested for their ability to substitute for their endogenous counterparts in a crude repair system based on whole cell extracts.  Additional, unknown proteins that may be required for repair will be identified by an activity complementation assay, or, in an alternative strategy, by protein-protein interaction assays.  If novel proteins are discovered, their role in double strand break repair will be validated by in vivo assays.  The reconstituted repair system, based on purified proteins, will then be used to investigate mechanistic steps in the repair pathway.  Defined oligonucleotide substrates will be used to characterize the assembly of repair proteins into complexes, with the objective of defining a series of complexes that are arrested at different stages of the pathway. \r\n\r\n     The DNA repair pathway that is to be defined in these studies is the major innate healing mechanism by which animals and humans respond to genetic damage from ionizing radiation.  Sources of ionizing radiation exposure include X-rays, gamma rays, and other particles emitted by radioactive materials.  Exposure to low level radiation is a significant issue on a global scale. An improved understanding of the fundamental biochemical processes underlying repair of radiation-induced DNA damage may lead to better ways to diagnose low level radiation exposure and protect against its effects.  An improved understanding of the Ku-dependent DNA repair pathway may also lead to a means to sensitize cells to therapeutic radiation.\r\n\r\n",
