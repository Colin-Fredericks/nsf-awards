 "awd_abstract_narration": "9819814\r\nDohn Glitz\r\nUniversity of California Los Angeles\r\nInstrumentation for High Resolution Shadowing for Electron Microscopy\r\nElectron Microscopy is a powerful and adaptable approach to the determination of the structure of biological molecules and macromolecular complexes.  Shadowing with heavy metals is an established technique for the visualization of such objects in electron micrographs, but the relatively thick and granular metal layers that are typically deposited by thermal evaporation limit the resolution that can be attained.  This award supports the development and fabrication of an apparatus for carefully controlled freeze-drying and high resolution shadowing of objects including ribosomes, invertasomes, spliceosomes, and transcription complexes.  Design and construction of the instrumentation is necessary because no commercial apparatus with the desired capabilities is available.  The design, however, is intended to be reasonably adaptable to use with common vacuum evaporators.\r\nPreliminary results indicate that layers of pure tungsten in which grain size (which limits potential resolution) is 0.7 to 0.8 nm will be generated.  This grain size is approximately seven-fold better than that attained using thermal evaporation of platinum.  The proposed instrumentation is based on experience with a prototype system.  The equipment includes devices for grid mounting and holding, their protected cryotransfer and controlled lyophilization within the chamber of the vacuum evaporator, and their shadowing at angles as low as 5 degree Celsius with the further capability of sample rotation.  The apparatus will include two electron guns designed such that the electrical field is auto-focussed on the tip of wire of the metal or other material to be evaporated.  Almost all of the energy of the electron beam is thus absorbed within a very small local volume at the tip of the wire, which is melted and vaporized in a very controlled manner.  The geometry of the system will be flexible and adaptable, and the inclusion of two electron guns within the system should allow independent evaporation of two different substances without reconfiguration of the system: e.g. tungsten and carbon evaporation could be done independently, or the two metals could be evaporated to shadow the same sample at two angles.  The instrumentation will be valuable to a wide range of structural investigations in molecular biology.  \r\n",
