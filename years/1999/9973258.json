 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the incorporation of local chemical\r\nstructure of DNA into a continuum rod model of the molecule.  In\r\nseveral instances, this requires an extension of the basic\r\ncapabilities of the Cosserat rod model.  For example, numerically\r\nefficient self-contact computations, and stability tests\r\nassociated with them, are required.  This represents an extension\r\nof classic calculus of variations methods to the case when the\r\nequilibrium Euler-Lagrange equations are integro-differential.\r\nIn addition, the investigator seeks an efficient incorporation of\r\nlocalized DNA flexibility into the rod model, which requires\r\ncareful study of the interaction of this flexibility with the\r\nrapid intrinsic twist of DNA.  These methods are applied to\r\nspecific DNA systems of biological interest, such as the\r\nTATA-box, in collaboration with an experimental biochemist.\r\n     Advances in experimental techniques and computational power\r\nover the past decade have offered for the first time the\r\npossibility of understanding the atomic-scale behavior of DNA.\r\nAt the same time, technology does not allow all-atom computer\r\nsimulations of DNA of realistic length; even if such simulations\r\nwere possible, they would in large part be wasteful, since they\r\nwould fail to take advantage of the highly constrained nature of\r\ndouble-helical DNA.  The challenge facing DNA modelers is to\r\nincorporate into simplified models this growing database of\r\natomic-scale information.  The projects pursued by the\r\ninvestigator seek to bridge this gap, with techniques that\r\nhopefully will be useful in a variety of other biochemical\r\nsystems.\r\n     The investigator studies the incorporation of local chemical\r\nstructure of DNA into a continuum rod model of the molecule.
