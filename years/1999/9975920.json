 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tAs plant biologists approach the 21st century there are tremendous opportunities for understanding the molecular basis of cellular physiology and differentiation, organ development, disease resistance, and stress tolerance, because of advancements in automated DNA sequencing.  These fundamental areas of plant research have been inundated with new sequence data that provide clues to the genetic elements central to plant life. The United States along with the international research community has promoted the complete genome sequencing of the model system Arabidopsis thaliana  to seed efforts in plant genomic research.  The value of this resource can not be overstated because of the significant conservation of gene sequence and protein function throughout evolutionary history.  The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) has played a major role in the Arabidopsis genome initiative and will publish the complete sequence of Chromosome II, more than 10% of the genome (16-17 megabase pairs out of an estimated 120 megabase pairs), in mid 1999.  TIGR has also been funded to annotate the entire Arabidopsis sequence so that data generated by the AGI (Arabidopsis Genome Initiative) international consortium will be curated and maintained in a unified and informative fashion.  \r\n\r\n\tThis award supports the construction of a complete Chromosome II microarray for functional genomic studies of Arabidopsis.  The Chromosome II microarray will be used to catalog gene expression at the whole chromosome level and to evaluate and extend the gene prediction algorithms that are now being employed for annotation of the complete genomic sequence.  At this stage of the genome program, approximately 30% of the predicted gene products are annotated as \"hypothetical proteins.\"  Identification of a corresponding mRNA species for these hypotheticals, using microarray technologies, will immediately add weight to the genome annotation.  Moreover, information about chromosomal gene expression patterns will lead to a more refined understanding of genome organization and the activation of gene networks.  Validation of our current gene predictions and correction of those hypothesis that are not physiologically relevant will enhance the value of this universal plant resource.  \r\n\r\n\tThe fundamentals of plant biology will be revealed by the Arabidopsis thaliana sequence: a reference genome for plant genomic research in the 21st century.  This microarray program will provide a means to map additional physiological data to the Arabdiopsis  sequence data and enhance its used for basic and applied plant research beneficial to our agricultural and economic national interests.  These observations of the Arabidopsis genome will be directly transferable to genome programs in other plant species, helping all research groups to realize the full potential of a National Plant Genome Research Program.\r\n",
