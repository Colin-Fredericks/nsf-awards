The degree of homology between PSII and purple non-oxygen evolving bacterial reaction centers will be investigated at P6s0 and the QA and QB binding sites. Time resolved pulsed EPR spectroscopy will be utilized to probe the relative geometry of the PSII electron transfer cofactors and details of the coupling of electron and proton transfer. Pulsed EPR experiments will help define the differences between the protein environments of PSII tyrosine radicals Yz and YD, with an aim of understanding the functional differences between these two tyrosine centers. Other experiments will be used to better describe the detailed magnetic and structural interactions between the manganese cluster and Yz. Time resolved EPR will be used to measure the dynamics of Yz, and to search for direct evidence of proton/electron transfer coupling through Yz. Rapid freeze quench experiments will target trapping of the radical YZ. species immediately before 02 formation and release. Further experiments will probe the role of a photoxidizeable chlorophyll, Chlz, in Photosystem II photoprotection.\r\n\r\nNontechnical:\r\n\r\n Magnetic resonance experiments are planned to provide new insights into how amino acid and cofactor radical species of the plant Photosystem II reaction center are utilized to split water, reduce quinones, and inject protons into the aqueous phase enclosed by the photosynthetic membrane, all with high quantum yield, and driven by low energy visible light. The advantage that photosynthetic processes are light driven allows specific radical trapping and transient kinetic experiments that would be difficult or impossible in other biological systems employing radical centers. Therefore these Photosystem II experiments will provide insights into diverse biochemical radical mechanisms that will have impact in the broader scientific arena.\r\n \r\n",
