 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate one of the most basic aspects of human\r\nperceptual intelligence, the ability to organize the visual world.\r\nPerceptual organization---the process whereby individual bits of the\r\nvisual image are aggregated into coherent, meaningful wholes---is a\r\nfundamental process that is known to influence many other aspects of\r\nvisual processing. Yet no mathematically well-defined theory of it\r\nexists. The key stumbling block is the pervasive but slippery notion\r\nknown as ``goodness of form,'' which has resisted attempts to define\r\nit rigorously.  The approach taken in this proposal is a modern,\r\nmathematically-motivated version of the idea that for any visual\r\nimage, human observers see the simplest interpretation possible. In\r\nmost previous renditions of this idea, the term ``simplest'' is only\r\nvery vaguely or subjectively defined. The lack of concrete definitions\r\nor algorithms in turn makes it impossible to determine empirically\r\nwhether the interpretation that human subjects see is, in fact, the\r\nsimplest.  Minimal Model (MM) theory builds on ideas from modern\r\ncomputational logic, with which which the term ``interpretation'' and\r\n``simple'' can be given extremely precise definitions. Under these\r\ndefinitions, it turns out that human judgments---for example, the way\r\nline drawings are grouped and organized---correspond closely to the\r\nformally minimal interpretation in a well-defined logical language.\r\nThis minimal interpretation is in a sense the least ``coincidental''\r\ninterpretation possible of a given scene; that is, the one that\r\nexplains the image best.  An efficient algorithm exists for rapidly\r\ncomputing the minimal interpretation.  Moreover predictions derived\r\nfrom this theory have already been used to answer some long-standing\r\nempirical questions about human perceptual grouping. The experiments\r\nto be conducted in this project investigate many of the most difficult\r\nand important problems in perceptual organization: the perception of\r\noccluded figures, the detection of figures amid complex and cluttered\r\nscenes, the interpretation of three-dimensional structure, and the\r\nrepresentation and categorization of shape. For each of these visual\r\ntasks, MM theory makes definite and concrete predictions what people\r\nwill see under various conditions, and about the limits of the visual\r\nsystem's ability to recover the true structure of the visual world.\r\nEducational activities in connection with this project include the\r\ncreation of new courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The\r\nproposed undergraduate course (Topics in Cognitive Research) and\r\ngraduate course (Mathematical Methods in Cognitive Science) emphasize\r\nan interdisciplinary approach to research in which both behavioral and\r\ncomputational studies are emphasized.\r\n\r\n",
