 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microtubules (MTs) are one of the major classes of cytoskeletal elements in eukaryotic cells.  They are characterized by their ability to elongate or rapidly disassemble in a regulated fashion.  They play important roles in maintenance or change of cellular shape, they serve as tracks along which subcellular organelles travel from one place in the cell to another, and they are critical to the partitioning of chromosomes during cell division.  They also play critical roles in cytoplasmic partitioning during embryonic development.  This project focuses on the roles played by MTs in the specification and/or maintenance of both the animal-vegetal axis of oocytes and the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of developing vertebrate embryos, using the African frog, Xenopus laevis, as the model system.  The rapid conversion between stable and dynamic MT's during oogenesis and the rapid assembly of the sperm aster and cortical MTs required for D-V axis specification place unique constraints on mechanisms regulating MT assembly.  Three microtubule-associated proteins, termed XMAP215, XMAP230, and XMAP310, have been isolated from Xenopus oocytes and eggs, where they are thought to play key roles in regulating MT assembly.  Of these XMAPs, XMAP 215 exhibits the unique property of promoting both the assembly and dynamics of MT plus-ends in vitro.  Results from these studies suggest that XMAP215 is responsible for the assembly and dynamics of MTs during oogenesis and early development.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research addresses the function of XMAP215 in vivo in regulating MT assembly during frog oogenesis and development.  Specific questions to be addressed include:\r\n1, is XMAP215 associated with MTs during Xenopus oogenesis and early development? The protein will be localized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and/or by expression of GFP-tagged or epitope-tagged XMAP215 mRNA microinjected into oocytes and embryos; specific MT arrays that occur during various stages of oocyte and embryo development will be examined. 2, is XMAP215 required for the assembly of specific microtubule arrays in vivo?  XMAP215 will be depleted by microinjection of antibodies or anti-sense oligodeoxyribonucleotides into living oocytes and embryos, and the effect of such depletion on MT organization and development will be examined by confocal microscopy using anti-tubulin antibodies. 3, Are XMAP215-M and XMAP215-Z functionally distinct? This question is based on the finding that there are two forms of XMAP215 mRNA in Xenopus eggs and embryos, a maternal form (-M) present in oocytes and pre-gastrula embryos, and a zygotic form (-Z) present in post-gastrula embryos.  These differ in that there is a 36-amino acid insert (Ins2) present only in the maternal form.  The developmental regulation of the expression of these two isoforms suggests that they may differ in their function and/or regulation.  As a first step in defining the functional distinction between the two isoforms, the proteins will be expressed in vitro, and their ability to bind to MTs and promote MT assembly in vitro will be examined.  In addition, epitope- and/or GFP-tagged versions of the zygotic form will be heterochronically expressed in oocytes and early embryos, to examine the function of this protein in vivo.  \r\n\r\nThe results of these studies will further our understanding of the role of XMAP215 in the spatial and temporal regulation of MT assembly and organization during oogenesis and early development in Xenopus, and will provide new insights into the role(s) that XMAP215 and/or its human homologues play more generally in the life of a cell or an organism.\r\n",
