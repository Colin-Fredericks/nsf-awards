Hornung, Graduate Aeronautical Laboratories, California Institute of Technology (Caltech), to pursue with Dr. Chung-Hwan Chun, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), for 36 months, a program of cooperative research on the design of a quiet supersonic Ludwieg tube with boundary layer removal.  The Ludwieg tube principle is recognized as one of the prime candidates for producing supersonic flow with low free-stream noise in the laboratory.  This is necessary for the study of the important problem of transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the supersonic regime.  In order to achieve this high flow quality, special measures have to be taken to prevent the boundary layer in the supply tube from entering the accelerating nozzle.  Experiments performed recently at POSTECH have pointed the way to how this can best be done.  Once operational, facilities at both institutions will be used in teaching laboratory courses and for graduate student research.\r\n\r\nJoint interests and ongoing projects to design and construct quiet supersonic Ludwieg tubes at Caltech and at POSTECH, and the complementary competence and expertise of the Caltech and POSTECH collaborators have led to the development of this project. Both institutions have separate support for the construction of their respective facilities.  This award will support travel of the PI and a graduate student to Korea in order to benefit from the exchange of information, in particular for using results from existing and new work done at POSTECH and Caltech in the designs.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
