 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research deals with discriminants of orthogonal polynomials \r\nand energy minimization problems where the equilibrium energy involves \r\na discriminant. We will study q-deformed and quantized analogues of \r\ndiscriminants which are defined as resultants. This involves developing \r\na theory of second order q-difference equations for polynomials \r\n orthogonal with respect to a positive measures whose masses are \r\nconcentrated on the union of at most two geometric progressions. \r\nWe will also consider certain indeterminate moment problems whose \r\nsolution involves elliptic functions and their generating functions \r\nsatisfy a Lame type differential equation. The Lame differential equations \r\nare also generating functions for a family of biorthogoal rational \r\nfunctions which are related to R-type continued fractions, a class of \r\ncontinued fractions Masson and I introduced and recently arose in \r\nsolving generalized  eigenvalue problems. We also intend to study spectral \r\ntheory of second order operator equations involving the Askey-Wilson \r\ndivided difference operator. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe plan to study the equilibrium position of a system of particles \r\nin an external field and find explicit formulas for the energy at \r\nequilibrium. We also intend to determine how large the energy gets \r\nwhen the number of particles gets large. This will be done in \r\ndifferent one dimensional models. Mathematically this leads to \r\na theory of the so called deformed infinite dimensional Lie algebras (named after Sophus Lie). Another focus will be moment problems where the \r\nobservations (moments) do not necessarily determine the \r\ndistribution (the physical law) but nevertheless one can find ``best\" \r\ndistributions. We are also concerned with spectral theory of \r\nthe operators called the Askey-Wilson operators. What we are trying to \r\nachieve is to describe their spectrum, which means describe the \r\npossible states of the  physical system obeying these equations. \r\n",
