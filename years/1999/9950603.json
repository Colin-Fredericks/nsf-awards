 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of neurons and other electrically active cells is one of the most important areas in biology, and almost all universities offer neurobiology courses to their undergraduates. Educators in many areas of biology are realizing the value of software that simulates biological experiments towards teaching students both concepts and how to think like scientists. Currently there is no comprehensive, general-purpose simulation program designed specifically for teaching neurobiology. This project is developing teaching software that can simulate a wide range of experiments. It is designed to be useful for beginning undergraduate students up through graduate students.  A set of laboratories is being written to go along with this software that teaches neurobiology concepts in an open-ended, exploratory way. The software also allows instructors to design their own laboratories or to modify our labs to suit their classes.\r\n",
