 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emily Carter of UCLA is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program and the Materials Theory Program to develop first-principles descriptions of the local electronic structure of condensed matter.  Method development includes embedding an explicitly correlated description of the electronic structure of a small region into a periodic slab whose electronic structure is treated by solid-state physics techniques.  Quantum chemical methods such as perturbation theory and bulk methods such as density functional theory will be employed.  The embedding potential will be constructed from terms involving the total density of the system and the density of the embedded region.  A corollary project involves the development of globally accurate kinetic energy density functionals.  Test applications include carbon monoxide and oxygen atom adsorption on transition metals.\r\n\r\nNew techniques are required to reliably predict accurate energetics of reactions and other processes in the condensed phase.  While some first-principles methods such as density functional theory have had extraordinary success, their general applicability has not been proven.  This research will pursue a systematic improvement to density functional theory for the energetics of a localized region embedded in a bulk material.",
