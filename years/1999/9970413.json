 "awd_abstract_narration": "9970413\r\n\r\nOur research is directed toward better understanding the internal structure and representation theory of certain classes of finitely generated noncommutative algebras.  The specific motivating examples include algebraic quantum groups and enveloping algebras of Lie superalgebras. The focus is mainly on prime and primitive ideal theory, and the underlying goal is to study primitive spectra in this context as a type of ``noncommutative affine algebraic geometry.''  Similarly, we seek to determine analogies between the primitive spectra of noncommutative Hopf algebras and affine algebraic groups; this latter objective is largely motivated by the role noncommutative Hopf algebras play in the theory of quantum groups.  The technical issues we are concered with in this work include morphisms, deformations, catenarity, module extensions, and ``small'' infinite dimensional quantum groups.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of our research are noncommutative associative algebras.  These abstract objects have provided an effective setting for studying systems of polynomial equations in noncommuting variables; such equations are basic to twentieth century mathematics and physics. Our aim in this research is to study a type of ``geometry'' arising from certain noncommutative systems of equations, in analogy to the classical geometry obtained from solutions to systems of polynomial equations in commuting variables.\r\n",
