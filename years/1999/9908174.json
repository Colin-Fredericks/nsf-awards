 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides additional funding for the development of an agent-based system for the design, process planning and manufacturing of precision milled parts.  The agents that will be developed consist of software packages containing information, databases, and instructions related to specialized knowledge on important aspects of the physics of manufacturing or specialized procedures.  In this work, the primary interest is on developing algorithms that embody the process physics and that will allow the minimization of residual stresses, enhancement of edge quality and improvement in tolerances in milling of precision mechanical components.  The result of the agent output will be minor adjustments to specific tool paths or operating conditions that will make a considerable improvement in part quality with acceptable sacrifice in \"time to first part.\"  This research will measure this trade-off between production speed and part quality quantitatively.  Experiments will be performed in which parts will be fabricated with a high edge quality and tolerance, and with concern for other part quality issues such as minimizing subsurface deformations and residual stresses.  The agents will be integrated into a high-end CAD system for detailed design, macro and micro planners, a tool path planner, and manufacturability feedback.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will lead to new software capability creating a broader Internet-based Agent Based Manufacturing System.  The system will specifically include agents for precision machining improvements and address issues of conflicting advice from competing agents.  The goal is to show that a considerable benefit in edge quality and tolerance can be achieved with only minimal sacrifice in production time compared to \"normal\" process planning.  Finally, a major focus will be on conflict resolution between agents and trade-offs between agent advice and cost-benefit analyses.  Specific methodologies, based in part on game theory, will be developed to address these conflicts.",
