 "awd_abstract_narration": "The applications of Number Theory to other fields have been attracting increasing interest in recent years. This investigation will exploit the rich interplay between Number Theory and Combinatorics. The problems to be investigated either have their origin in Combinatorics or have immediate application to Combinatorics, yet the problems themselves are Number- Theoretic. Roughly speaking, the problems in this investigation can be divided into two parts. The first part is an extension of the recent joint  work with C.-L. Chai, concerning explicit constructions of automorphic  froms for general linear groups over function fields from geometric setting. Such forms will automatically satisfy the generalized Ramanujan conjecture. The Sato-Tate conjecture for the automorphic forms whose Fourier coefficients  are eigenvalues of certain Ramanujan graphs is expected to be proved. Also  proposed in this part is the study of Ramanujan hypergraphs, their connection  with buildings, and the connection between the eigenvalues of hypergraphs and  eigenvalues of Hecke operators. The purpose is to understand to which extent  the connection between Ramanujan graphs and classical cusp forms can be  generalized to higher rank groups. The second part is applications of number  theory to the construction of good codes. The proposed approaches include  p-adic analysis, character sum estimates, and explicit constructions of infinite towers of curves with many rational points. The PI plans to write a sequal to her book \"Number Theory with Applications\", including  results on the interaction between number theory and eigenvalues of Ramanujan graphs obtained in recent years as well as new results from this proposal.  The content of this book will also be taught in a graduate course at her home  institution.\r\n\r\nThis research falls into the general mathematical fields of Number Theory and Combinatorics.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems, which is the central theme of modern information theory. Combinatorics is also an indispensable tool in modern communications. One of the goals of Combinatorics is to find efficient methods of studying how discrete collections of objects can be arranged. The design of large networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems, good error-correcting codes used in satellite and wireless  communications, and the design of algorithms in computer science deal with  discrete sets of objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research using techniques from number theory.\r\n",
