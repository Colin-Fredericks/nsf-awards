The Principal Investigator is Dr. Louis Motz, Associate Professor of Civil Engineering, at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, Florida.  The Turkish collaborator is Dr. Recep Yurtal, Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering at Cukurova University in Adana, Turkey.  They plan to develop a simulation-optimization model for conjunctive use of surfacewater and groundwater in a coastal plain in Turkey.  A groundwater simulation model for the area of Silifike Plain on the southern coast of Turkey on the Mediterranean Sea will be developed under the direction of Dr. Motz.  He plans to use a US Geological Survey developed sharp interface model (SHARP) to simulate the movement of saltwater-freshwater interface.  An optimization model will be developed for the same area under the direction of Dr. Yurtal.   \r\n\r\nScope:  This project deals with an area of importance to Turkey and the United States where groundwater is increasingly being utilized in coastal areas.  Dr. Motz is a well-known and experienced researcher in the field, who is currently directing two projects in the area of hydrology and groundwater in Florida.  It is expected that this collaborative project will complement, and benefit from, his current research.  Dr. Yurtal's expertise is in operations research and optimization.  He also has the support of the Government of Turkey's State Hydraulic Works, which will provide the required available data and will help collect additional data as needed.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting joint research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is co-funded by INT and the Division of Earth Sciences.   \r\n",
