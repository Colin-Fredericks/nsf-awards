 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to promote conceptual understanding, improve problem solving skills and increase student motivation, this project will make three coordinated changes in two general physics courses at Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW).  These changes include the adaptation and implementation of Microcomputer Based Laboratory tools (Thornton and Sokoloff) as the foundation for changes in the laboratories and lecture.  First, the laboratories for the courses will be changed to a combination of (1) laboratory skill development (CPT laboratories) with (2) complex/real world problem (C/RW) laboratories which promote qualitative problem solving procedures, experiment design, measurement techniques and data analysis.  The CPT laboratories will be adapted from Laboratory Manual for Physics from Ohio State University (Published by Burgess Pub., 1995) with modifications to incorporate data analysis procedures.  Six C/RW problem laboratories for each course will be developed that incorporate the use of Interactive Physics in modeling the systems for analysis.  The second change will be adaptation and implement Interactive Lecture Demonstrations on kinematics, Newton's Laws, rotational dynamics, electric field, electric current, magnetic force and electromagnetic induction for the class segment of the course.  The third change will be the development of four complex/real world problems also for use in the class segment of the courses.   Evaluation of the project will focus on conceptual development and qualitative problem solving skills of the students.  A laboratory manual with instructor's notes will be produced so other instructors can implement these materials.\r\n",
