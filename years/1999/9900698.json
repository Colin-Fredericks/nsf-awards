However, few Principal Investigators or their staff have the required background to develop and implement an accountability system for their projects.  This award will support the development of the tools for projects within the Advanced Technological Education Program to be able to carry out accountability assessments against a common framework of outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        In concert with ATE PIs, the Evaluation Center at Western Michgan University will prepare a set of indicators that represent quality technical education, prepare and pilot test instruments and guidebooks for data collection, and report data from the ATE projects that will provide information to the field on the impact and effectiveness of technological education.",
