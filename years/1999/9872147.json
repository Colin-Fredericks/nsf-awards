 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer simulations are now an important means of understanding many\r\ncomplex physical phenomena.  Numerical simulations are now vital in\r\nstructural analysis, fluid dynamics, chemistry, and biomechanics for both\r\nresearch and commercial purposes. Unfortunately, although parallel\r\nalgorithms and supercomputer systems can now handle the raw computations,\r\nvisualization and data processing tools have failed to keep up with these\r\nadvances.  As a result, computers can generate a staggering amount of data\r\n- hundreds or thousands of gigabytes in time-dependent analysis - that must\r\nstill be translated to a form that humans can effectively understand.\r\nWithout this translation, the value of simulation and analysis is sharply\r\nreduced. This project will study new visualization methods and\r\narchitectures needed to effectively apply numerical simulation tools.\r\n\r\nThis project describes a data-flow architecture that can manage large data\r\nsets using computers ranging from small single-processor CPU's to high-end\r\nsupercomputers. The architecture minimizes disk access, maximizes use of\r\navailable memory, and lends itself to parallel algorithms. The approach is\r\nto stream coherent blocks of data between processes, and minimizing system\r\noverhead through careful use of configurable data caches and parsimonious\r\ndata filters. This extends previous work by the investigators in an image\r\nprocessing toolkit to handle more complex dataset types objects such as\r\nunstructured grids.  The investigators will build their software as a\r\ntoolkit of interoperable objects, and will make the software freely\r\navailable to other researchers.\r\n\r\n",
