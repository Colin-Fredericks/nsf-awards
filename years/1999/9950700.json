 "awd_abstract_narration": "Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is an important technique for practitioners of Chemistry, Materials Science, Physics, and Earth Science. It is the primary method for identifying and quantifying the phases in solid samples. Consequently, equipment for powder XRD experiments in the undergraduate lab is potentially of great pedagogical value. However, there are two sizable problems associated with the use of powder XRD in undergraduate lab classes: the equipment has traditionally been expensive and the collection of a powder diffraction pattern suitable for qualitative or quantitative analysis takes between 15 and 30 minutes. A typical lab class is too short to allow each student to collect and analyze their own data if a single instrument is employed, and the high cost of the instrumentation precludes the purchase of multiple systems if the instrumentation is only employed for a small number of experiments each year.\r\n\r\nRecently, Rigaku has begun marketing a low cost powder XRD system (Miniflex) that is designed with portability and fieldwork in mind. The purchase of three identical Miniflex systems for use in both Chemistry and Materials Science (MSE) undergraduate classes is proposed. These small rugged systems will be set up on lab carts and controlled using lap top computers. Their portability will allow us to move the instrumentation between classrooms and buildings so that the maximum possible impact can be obtained. The purchase of three identical systems will give us the sample throughput needed to provide every undergraduate in a lab class with hands on experience. This hardware will be used in the following Chemistry and Materials Science classes: analytical chemistry (for both engineers and chemistry majors), organic chemistry, physical chemistry, advanced inorganic chemistry, MSE crystallography and diffraction, and the MSE Materials Laboratory. The proposed project will benefit 400 students per year.\r\n",
