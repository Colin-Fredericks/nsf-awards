 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports research to obtain and interpret new chronological data for glacial deposits and landforms in the Transantarctic Mountains. One focus will be to determine the age of the Sirius Group deposits, which are generally believed to record significantly warmer Antarctic climates, implying that the East Antarctic Ice Sheet has been unstable in the past. Because the East Antarctic Ice Sheet contains such a large fraction of the Earth's fresh water this is crucial to understanding past climate changes. The primary evidence for warmer Antarctic climates is the existence of fossil Beech leaves and wood within some Sirius Group tillites. The central question is when this occurred, with evidence based on fossil diatoms in the Sirius Group suggesting that it was roughly 3 million years ago, and evidence based on geomorphology suggesting it was at least 10 million years ago. In order to obtain minimum ages for these important glacial deposits, cosmic ray produced helium and neon (3He and 21Ne) will be measured in clinopyroxene mineral separates from key Sirius Group outcrops. The method, commonly referred to as exposure age dating, relies on the assumption that the accumulation of 3He and 21Ne in surficial samples is related to cosmic ray exposure, and hence is directly related to time. The studies will include samples from the Dry Valleys region of McMurdo Sound as well as those far to the south in the Queen Maude Mountains (Beardmore and Shackleton Glacier area) that were collected during the 1995/1996 Austral summer field season. Preliminary ages from Bennett Platform (Shackleton Glacier) demonstrate the viability of the method, yielding ages of approximately 11 million years. The new data will help determine whether there are systematic age differences between the various localities, which might help reconcile the conflicting climatic and geologic models. In order to establish the reliability of the methods, multiple samples from each locality will be analyzed, and several different cosmogenic nuclides will be used to check for consistency. The preliminary data already demonstrate that some locations yield excellent age consistency (Bennett Platform and Table Mountain) while others do not. Field observations will be used to evaluate the assumptions of the method, including measurements on associated bedrock samples (which should yield older ages) and shielded samples (which should yield zero age). The exposure age data for the bedrock samples will yield minimum age estimates for the landscapes in the Transantarctic Mountains and allow calculation of the maximum erosion rates, both of which will test the hypothesis that ice-free landscapes in the Transantarctic mountains are at least 10 million years old and are modified minimally by erosion.\r\n\r\n",
