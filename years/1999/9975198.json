 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individuation is a basic and fundamental aspect of cognition which \r\npervades everyday thinking and perception. We treat some \r\nthings and not others as distinct individuals. For example, looking out \r\nonto a beach, we may perceive a barking, furry, four legged thing as \"a \r\ndog.\" We treat the dog as a distinct individual. However, we do not \r\nindividuate the sand below the dog.  Instead, we construe sand as a \r\nnonindividuated entity. These and other observations suggest that there \r\nare two fundamentally different kinds of things in the world -individuated\r\nentities and non-individuated entities. The proposed research addresses\r\nindividuation in a variety of ways, including a cross-cultural approach. \r\n\r\nWhat perceptual and conceptual factors lead people to individuate \r\nsome aspects of their world but not others? People appear to individuate\r\nthings across diverse domains that appear to have little in common and \r\nwithin domains that appear to have much in common. For example, some abstract concepts are individuated (e.g.,idea, wish) but others are not (e.g., evidence, insanity). Some events are individuated  (e.g., party, explosion) but not others (e.g., sleep, running). We will conduct studies which identify the causal factors of individuation. Experiments will also be conducted to clarify the role of language in individuation by conducting studies with adult Japanese speakers that parallel those with adult English speakers. This issue is of interest because languages vary in how and to what extent they signal individuation. English uses count/mass syntax to signal individuation. In contrast, Japanese uses classifiers and certain quantifying modifiers and shows less tendency to explicitly signal individuation. The results of these experiments should allow us to make significant progress in developing a general theory of individuation. From a practical point of view, the cross-cultural work may improve second-language learning. In addition, the roposed methodologies may eventually be adapted to diagnostic tools for very basic language and thought disorders.\r\n",
