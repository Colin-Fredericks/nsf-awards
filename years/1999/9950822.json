 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global positioning systems (GPS) and electronic total stations (EDM) are essential field equipment for gathering spatial data for geographic information system (GIS) analysis. These tools are increasingly applied in a variety of research and professional activities by earth, environmental, and geographical scientists, but at present few undergraduate students outside surveying programs are exposed to the technologies. Training materials and applications developed by manufacturers are designed only to meet the needs of this specialist audience. Our objective is to employ Geometronics Spectra Precision EDMs, Trimble GPSs, and IBM laptops, in the development of a series of course modules that will significantly augment our existing multi-disciplinary field-based GIS curriculum.  As such, this represents an adaptation and expansion of the efforts of others with NSF support as well as the adaptation of industrial and research applications for use by college students.  The four innovative features of this project are: 1) integrating this equipment into the existing multi disciplinary science curriculum, teaching students to gather high quality data in the field using current technologies; 2) adapting manufacturer's published training materials and supporting technical literature for an undergraduate audience; 3) designing an adaptable field data recording methodology and documentation system integrating GPS and EDM to generate data for discipline-specific laboratory analysis; 4) developing software extensions and operational procedures to import data directly into the GIS software currently in use in our GIS laboratory.  Regular bulletins are posted on our website, which include progress reports, a selection of the student projects produced in each of our four GIS classes, and a full set of our teaching materials for integrating EDM, GPS, and GIS as they are developed. Target audiences are undergraduates in the earth, environmental and geographic sciences, K-12 teachers working with the state geographic alliance, and non-matriculated students from the local professional communities.",
