 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biology at Hope College believes that undergraduate students learn biology best by doing biology. The institution has put this belief into practice by integrating research and teaching in their courses and by providing students with opportunities to become partners with the faculty in professional level research. This award will provide research appointments for thirty undergraduate students (ten per summer for three years). Half of the students will come from Hope College and half will come from other colleges and universities throughout the U.S. This REU project will make special efforts to recruit and appoint women and members of minority groups underrepresented in science. Students will participate in research at all levels of biology, from cloning a new receptor for vasopressin to studying seed dispersal in a tropical cloud forest.  Interactions among students and faculty will provide each participant with knowledge about a wide range of biological problems and ways in which those problems are addressed. In addition to the research itself, participants will take part in weekly meetings aimed at improving oral and written communication skills, exploring ethical issues in biology, and learning about graduate school and career opportunities in biology. Students will communicate the results of their research in formal talks (at Hope and at professional meetings), at a poster symposium, and in a scientific paper. The Hope program will have an impact on the student participants' understanding of science, impact the sciences as the students present their results to the scientific community, and impact society as students move on to graduate schools and a variety of careers.",
