 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researchers are developing an infrastructure that supports a) automatic generation of the functionality and architecture of a collaborative application, b) reuse of existing programs, and c) easy substitution of\r\ninfrastructure-provided components with custom ones. This research can have two kinds of impact. First, it can give application programmers a path for incrementally developing a collaborative application, enabling them to quickly discover tools that do not lend themselves to collaborative access and gradually fine-tune the functionality and architecture of those that do.  Second, it can allow developers of complete collaborative applications and infrastructures to become builders of individual components, sharing complex designs and implementations in diverse areas such as distributed systems, transactions, user-interfaces, and real-time communication.\r\n\r\nThe researchers are using existing collaboration systems to guide their investigation. In particular, they are re-implementing successful designs of collaboration systems using their infrastructure and existing single-user software. They are evaluating how well their infrastructure supports i) reuse by determining how many changes are required to existing software to make it work with infrastructure components, ii) composition by determining the extent to which components are shared among the collaborative systems\r\nthey implement, and iii) automation by determining how much effort is required in the implementation effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
