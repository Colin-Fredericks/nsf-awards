 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theory evaluation has been an enduring and important topic in the history and philosophy of science literature. Philosophers of biology have done some work on theory evaluation in population genetics. However, it has been limited to the role experimentation plays in evaluation and to general criteria for evaluating empirical claims made by models. This dissertation research project is premised on the view that there is more to theory evaluation than experimentation and the evaluation of empirical claims made by models. Differently put, theory evaluation in population genetics is a process which occurs throughout theory development, or the process of constructing, testing, and revising theories. It includes what philosophers of biology have already contributed, but it also includes evaluation criteria that are operative during the construction and revision of theories. Theory evaluation is not merely the testing of completed theories or aspects of completed theories. This project examines theory evaluation in the context of theory development in population genetics. The goal is to fill a gap in the philosophy of biology literature. The project will  result in an historical and philosophical examination of the ongoing R.A. Fisher-Sewall Wright debate in population genetics. The Fisher-Wright debate is a theory choice debate that concerns the extent to which either Fisher's or Wright's population genetics theories are applicable to evolution in natural populations. The debate is currently in its eighth decade unresolved. By critically examining the criteria used to evaluate Fisher's and Wright's theories during the debate, the project  will attempt to construct a philosophical view on theory evaluation in population genetics. The Fisher-Wright debate has been discussed in the history of biology literature from its inception in the early 1920s to the early 1960s (the death of Fisher). In the main, the Fisher-Wright debate has been presented either in the context of its role in the evolutionary synthesis of the 1930s through -1950s, the unification of numerous fields of evolutionary biology, or as part of Fisher's or Wright's scientific biography. It has not been analyzed strictly as a theory choice debate. The debate has recently been rekindled in the biology literature and indicates that it has been active from the 1920s to the present. A preliminary examination of the Fisher-Wright debate has revealed six criteria for the evaluation of population genetics theories. Some of the criteria have been discussed in previous, and more general, philosophical work on theory choice. These criteria include, e.g., internal consistency, generality in scope of application, experimental adequacy. Other criteria appear not to have been discussed in any historical or philosophical context. These criteria include \"representational adequacy,\" \"computational tractability,\" and the criterion that theories must \"contain experimentally measurable parameters.\" This project is expected  to yield further criteria as well as revealing their hierarchy of application.",
