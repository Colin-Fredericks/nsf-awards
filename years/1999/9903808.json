However, how the interactions of plant and insects that feed on those plants under elevated CO2 is not very well understood.  This study proposes to address three questions about how populations and communities may be affected by changes in plant insect interactions in high CO2 atmospheres, using insect species from different feeding guilds reared on whole plants. The first experiment will determine how insects from different feeding guilds respond to a single host plant grown under elevated CO2. In the second experiment, both Nitrogen and CO2 treatments will be used to examine in detail the interactive effects of these environmental factors on both plant and insect performance.  The last experiment proposed in this study would examine the potential effects of altered herbivore preferences on plant competitive interactions within a multi-species host plant assemblage. It will greatly extend our knowledge of how the feeding responses of different insects to changes in host plant quality under high CO2 will affect both herbivore and plant performance. The components of this research will provide important insight into how elevated CO2 atmospheres will affect insect-plant interactions at the individual, population, and community levels. \r\n",
