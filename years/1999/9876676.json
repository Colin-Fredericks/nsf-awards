 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nationwide, research universities that prepare undergraduates as K-12 science and mathematics teachers come up short. Education majors are routed through uncoordinated courses that often fail to link their mathematics and science courses and their teacher preparation courses. Frequently, teacher preparation programs do not identify students who could become strong science and mathematics teachers. Finally, many early-career mathematics and science teachers don't get the support they need to stay with and grow in their careers. The Kansas Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (KCETP) seeks to reverse this pattern and proposes a plan to create a coherent teacher preparation program in mathematics and science that is not duplicated with any other program or agency in the state. With NSF support, this three-year Track 1 CETP project will 1) create the KCETP Academy to deliver a reformed teacher preparation program by supportive collaborations between Universities, Two-year Colleges, and School Districts; 2) develop and implement a plan for the recruitment and retention of minority students; 3) modify Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (SMET) content courses to model best practices in pedagogy; 4) involve education students in SMET research; and 5) mentor early-career K-12 teachers. KCETP is led by the University of Kansas (KU) and Kansas State University (KSU) and includes four Two-year Colleges and ten major School Districts along a 120-mile corridor of Interstate 70. Its proposed program is aligned with the national mathematics and science education standards. It will promote a statewide strategy that can be used as a national model for the reform of mathematics and science teacher preparation. KCETP programs will be coordinated with NSF and Department of Education projects at KU and KSU that support professional development and K-12 curriculum innovation.",
