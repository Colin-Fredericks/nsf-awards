 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recent discovery by F. Gesztesy and the PI reveals a relationship\r\nbetween the KdV equation and the condition that the associated ordinary\r\nlinear differential equations have only meromorphic solutions. The same\r\nrelationship exists also for the AKNS system. Both, the KdV equation and\r\nthe AKNS system, are completely integrable Hamiltonian systems. It is\r\nanticipated that the relationship pertains to more general integrable\r\nsystems and the major object of the project is to establish this. An\r\nimportant role in this respect is played by so called algebro-geometric\r\nsolutions of the integrable system under consideration which assume the\r\nrole of potentials of the associated linear equations. The PI plans an\r\nexpansion of abelian function theory to include functions on singular\r\nalgebraic curves since this is required for a complete characterization\r\nof algebro-geometric potentials. Algebro-geometric potentials associated\r\nwith the KdV equation give also the first tractable examples of\r\nquasi-periodic, non-selfadjoint differential operators. It is planned to\r\ninvestigate such operators and their spectrum and to develop an inverse\r\nspectral theory for them.\r\n\r\nIntegrable systems and, in particular, the KdV equation play an\r\nimportant role in mathematical physics were they are used as models for\r\nvarious phenomena, e.g., in mechanics, hydrodynamics, and nonlinear\r\noptics. Even for systems which are not integrable it is often fruitful\r\nto consider them as perturbations of integrable systems. Likewise,\r\ninverse spectral theory is a central part of applied mathematics since\r\nit is fundamental in areas ranging from quantum theory to computer\r\ntomography. Therefore this line of research has enjoyed an enormous\r\namount of attention in the past and will so in the future. This project\r\nis part of that endeavor.\r\n",
