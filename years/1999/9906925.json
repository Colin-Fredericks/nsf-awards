 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tDuring the planning year, the School District of Philadelphia, the Community College of Philadelphia (CCP), and the College of Science and Technology at Temple University, will collaborate to produce an equity program for girls and women in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology.  Representatives from these institutions, from industry, and from local high schools will interact to design a program that will intervene at critical stages of the students' education - during high school, college and graduate school.  For example, summer enrichment programs, academic year activities and summer bridge programs will be planned for high school girls.  Programs will be developed for college freshmen and sophomore females.  Because many students transfer to Temple from CCP as juniors, the high school and the college freshmen and sophomore programs will be developed in parallel at the two institutions.  Components will be designed to support upper level female undergraduate and graduate students.  A seminar series and a mentoring program will address and ameliorate the problems of female students.  Committees will oversee the development of the program and introduce specific components during the planning year.  The overall goal is to produce an intervention program which will serve as an urban model for gender equity.",
