As the technology for miniaturization advances, transistors- the basic microelectronic circuit building block-scale down in size form 1.5 um to 0.25um in length.  At the soma e time, the tolerance variation problem becomes more serious because disturbances do not scale down proportionally.  \r\nThe problem of interconnect crosstalk arises from electromagnetic coupling between signal paths on a chip which if left unoptimized may cause logic hazards, signal delay and circuit malfunction.  A variety of schemes for modeling crosstalk noise including FDTD and spectral analysis are the subject of intense research; however more generalized cost-effective methods are needed.\r\nA novel ANN-based tool which allows a designer to explore and constructively exploit the interrelation between the performance and parameters of an integrated circuit will be investigated.\r\nA survey of pertinent literature shows that computationally intensive evaluation of highly non-linear analytic functions is today being replaced by more convenient and cost effective mathematical constructs such as artificial neural network (ANN's),  look-up tables and response surface approximations.\r\nResearch will be carried out collaboratively over a 12-month period at three sites.  University of Hartford (the proposer's  home institution),  Georgia Tech (ECE Intelligent Semiconductor Manufacturing Group ) and Imperial College, London (Circuits and Neurosystems Design Groups).\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
