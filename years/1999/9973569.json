 "awd_abstract_narration": "The common underlying theme of all approaches to robustness is the construction of statistical procedures that perform well in the neighborhood of the assumed parametric model. In this context, the goodness of fit aspect of statistical modeling is no longer relevant.  Another problem with all these approaches is that statistical methods are developed for the location-scale models and are not easily extended to other types of models. \r\n\r\nI will explore the development of a robust theory in parametric estimation that addresses the above two problems and it is computationally easy to use. The new theory will address robustness problems that arise in the theory and application of mixture models, linear regression, logistic regression and generally in the application of generalized linear models. The basis for my approach is outlined in the joint papers by \r\nMarkatou, Basu and Lindsay (1997, 1998) and the paper by Lindsay (1994).  The robustness of the new methodology will be studied via classical tools (such as breakdown) and via less traditional tools (such as \r\nstability of the corresponding estimating equations).  This POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
