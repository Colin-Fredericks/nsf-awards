 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed study plans to examine different characteristics from two groups of USI schools;  the exemplary and the typical.  The goal is to assess how math and science reform is being implemented in the more effective schools, by identifying their activities, policies and practices. The proposal outlines a  methodology to examine the correlation between the NSF drivers for systemic reform and student achievement. This focus on student outcomes will also include analysis of subgroups of students, those traditionally  underrepresented in science and math.  The target population will be fourth graders from schools in two USI sites: El Paso and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nA mix of linked qualitative and quantitative data will be gathered to examine the following research questions:\r\n1. What are the activities, policies and practices of exemplary USI elementary schools that differentiate them from typical USI elementary schools?\r\n2. How are the practices that the most effective related to each of the NSF drivers?\r\n3. Are there other practices that are not related to the drivers but that characterize exemplary USI schools?\r\n4. Are the more exemplary activities, policies, and practices equally effective across sub-populations of students?  If not, which set of practices works best for specific sub-populations?\r\n5. How can the characteristics that result in the more exemplary schools inform systemic reform efforts in other SI schools as well as non-SI schools?\r\n",
