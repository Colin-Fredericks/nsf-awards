 "awd_abstract_narration": "A consortium of seven diverse institutions has been established to adapt and adopt the Workshop Chemistry peer-led team-learning model, which was developed as part of the NSF initiative for Systemic Changes in the Undergraduate Chemistry Curriculum.  This 98-Workshop Chemistry Consortium (98-WCC) includes Coastal Carolina University (SC), Goucher College (MD), Indiana University/Purdue University at Indianapolis (IN), Prince George's Community College (MD), State University of West Georgia (GA), and State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (NY), with Miami University (OH) serving as lead institution.  The PI representing each institution has already implemented a pilot Workshop Chemistry program, and this project expands these efforts to serve larger numbers of students in a variety of courses.  The 98-WCC works closely with the parent coalition and the 1997 MACK Workshop Chemistry consortium to refine and extend the Workshop Chemistry model by addressing workshop and laboratory integration, and the use of hands-on activities to serve as the basis of workshop lessons.  We also cooperate with the parent coalition in testing models for peer-leader training, stimulating collaboration between chemistry faculty and learning specialists to improve campus training of workshop leaders, and working with the earlier projects to evaluate the model and facilitate its use by other institutions.  Teacher preparation will be directly addressed at Goucher College which expects ultimately to be offering a course jointly between the chemistry department and the education department, exposing future teachers of science to the Workshop teaching environment, and at Indiana University - Purdue University, Indianapolis where a teaching methods course is being developed for secondary education majors in which they will be required to serve as student leaders for Workshop Chemistry.",
