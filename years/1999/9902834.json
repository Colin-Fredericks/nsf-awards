 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Olivier de Montmollin will conduct two seasons of archaeological research at the sites of Tenam Rosairo and Loma Zorrillo followed by an additional season of laboratory analysis. Both Mayan sites, located in Chiapas Mexico, were occupied during the Classic period and thus have the potential to shed light on Mayan social organization at the civilization's height. Prior mapping at both sites have revealed complexes of structures. Loma Zorrillo has 3 domestic wards and 3 civic plazas with 159 housemounds arranged in 90 household groups. Tenam Rosario has 4 domestic wards and 10 civic plazas with 239 housemounds arranged in 114 housegroups. The housemounds at both sites are stone-lined, some with interior features such as partitions or small platforms and/or exterior features such as porches. In addition to dwellings, other domestic housegroup features include alters, sub-dwellings, boundary walls, terraces bell-shaped pits and other features. Thus the wealth of material at both sites provide an excellent basis for examination of within site variation. Dr. de Montmollin and collaborators will excavate a series of structures to determine the degree of variation in wealth as measured by ceramics, lithics, shell, bone, weaving implements, figurines and other cultural materials. Broad horizontal exposures will allow for spatial analysis and for household size and degree of internal differentiation to be determined.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the research is to understand how Mayan civilization was structured and how large numbers of people were integrated into functioning social units. It is clear based on past work in the region that social differentiation existed and wealth was not evenly distributed across the population. However the amount of difference and whether it was in degree rather than kind is still unknown. Based on numerous publications by many authors, Dr. de Montmollin has distilled four potential models of prehistoric Mayan class structured social organization and the proposed research will allow him to select among them.\r\n",
