The project will analyze the use of prenatal diagnostic tests, specifically amniocentesis and obstetrical ultrasound in Germany.  While government policy recommends a minimum of three ultrasounds per pregnancy, German society has a history of eugenic misuse of biomedical testing and a vociferous current public discourse against neo-eugenics. .  The outcome is that the German public uses these prenatal tests at a much higher rate than other comparable populations, although with tremendous international variation. The project will compare ethnic Germans and immigrant Turkish residents in their use of the technology, testing hypotheses about the relative roles of public discourse, government policy, and the importance of ethnic, religious, income and education variables in the use of ultrasound.   The student will conduct ethnographic research at clinical, research institute, and community settings in three mid-sized cities in Germany.  The project will advance our knowledge of the social and ethical dimensions of biomedical technology use. In addition the project supports the training of a young social scientist, and advances our knowledge of this important area of the world. \r\n",
