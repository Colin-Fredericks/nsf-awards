 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographers are interested in how spatial displays like maps and aerial photographs can be efficiently processed to obtain critical information. This research will determine the critical components of visual search and will construct a simulation model for the process.   In addition, cognitive experiments related to the processes humans use to search for targets on complex remotely sensed imagery will be undertaken.  The method uses a multiple target design and considers contextual objects in the display as well as the usual target and distractor objects.  An analysis of variance will be used to determine the imagery and human subject variables that significantly affects the variation of search times.  It is expected that some objects in the display, that are known to be associated with the target objects, play a significant role in visual searches of complex imagery.    \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the research is to investigate the processes used by humans to visually search complex remotely sensed imagery.  A complete understanding of these processes is important to advancing cognitive science because efficient processes can be documented and taught to students.  This knowledge is also important for the creation of intelligent computer programs that can automatically search for targets on remotely sensed imagery.  \r\n",
