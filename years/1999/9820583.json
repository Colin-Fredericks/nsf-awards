Charles Yang\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to:  (1) enhance the technical and educational backgrounds of undergraduate students (with a goal of 50% participants in women and minority groups) by offering more collaborative research activities, (2) increase the number of women and minorities entering graduate school by providing vital information and necessary training for their admission to and success in graduate school, (3) assist undergraduate students in their development towards obtaining employment in high level engineering jobs, and (4) promote the interactions, both academic and industry, between minority and non-minority students.  Women, minority, and non-minority students in their junior and senior years of study will participate in this project.  The minority students will be recruited mainly from Wichita State University (WSU).  The ten selected students per year will participate in several composites research projects in the Composites Laboratory at the National Institute for Aviation Research during the academic year and summer.  Besides the faculty advisors specialized in advanced composites from both Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Departments of WSU, experts from Boeing, Cessna, Raytheon have agreed to serve as Industrial Advisory Board Members to direct and advise student research.  Parallel with the research component each participant will receive professional counseling and instruction necessary for planning to attend graduate school, with particular attention given to admissions and funding.  Participants will attend quarterly seminars regarding improved technical writing, graduate school success for women and minorities, and ethical issues in engineering.  The investigators have confidence that the program will be successful in training women, minority, and non-minority students and assist them in developing research skills needed for their industrial career as well as graduate studies.\r\n",
