More especifically, mutation testing and document reading techniques will be tailored to detect defects in software formal specifications and source code at Brazilian and American academia and industries. This family of software analysis technologies will be empirically validated in controlled experiments, and packaged in tailorable and reusable software engineering laboratory packages. The goals of this work are: (1) to create software analysis technologies that can be successfully used for defect detection in software specifications and code, and develop empirical methods that can be followed to continually improve those techniques in different environments and cultural settings; (2) to develop evaluation methods that can be used to compare diverse software defect detection technologies in academic and industrial settings; (3) to expand the software analysis technology base, creating new laboratory packages that can be adapted and reused by other software engineering researchers, based upon their own environmental and cultural needs\r\n",
