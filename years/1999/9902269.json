However, very few studies have examine this problem using a solid experimental design. This study will examine the impacts of the invasive European honeybee (Apies mellifera) on native pollinator and plant communities in coastal California. This work will investigate and quantitatively link the impacts of European bee on foraging behavior and colony reproductive success for an important group of native pollinators, the bumblebees (Bombus spp). This is proposed to be done by combinations of large-scale manipulations of bee densities, measurement of resource availability and depletion, monitoring of bumblebee colony performance and quantitative modeling of competitive effects. In addition to providing information on the impact of invasive species on native communities, this work will provide insight into how and why invasive species cause community-level effects and it will contribute to a greater understanding of competitive interactions among behaviorally flexible colonial organisms.\r\n",
