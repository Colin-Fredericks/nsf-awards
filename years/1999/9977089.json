 "awd_abstract_narration": "9977089\r\nGoerss\r\n     Throughout different fields of mathematics, it is important to\r\nunderstand how various objects acquire some sort of multiplication.\r\nFor example, in homotopy theory, which is the study of mathematical\r\nphenomena that remain invariant under continuous deformation, one\r\nwants to decide if an object has a multiplication that is commutative\r\nup to all ``higher homotopies'' -- this is the type of multiplication\r\nthat is invariant under deformation.  One way to discuss this issue is\r\nwith the device of opera, which make rigorous the phrase ``higher\r\nhomotopies.''  Goerss intends to develop and explore these ideas in\r\nthe context of homotopy theory; for example, he would like to discuss\r\nwhen a spectrum has an operad multiplication, and to discuss the\r\nimplications of the fact that the cochains on a topological space have\r\nsuch multiplications.\r\n     The broad goal of this project is to further understanding of\r\nhomotopy theory, the branch of topology concerned with properties of\r\nhigher-dimensional surfaces and other geometric objects that remain\r\ninvariant under continuous deformation.  There are some surprising\r\nand rather mysterious connections between homotopy theory and seemingly\r\nunrelated fields of mathematics such as number theory and algebraic\r\ngeometry, and one hopes the project will ultimately illuminate these.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
