 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Sion   AST 99-01955\r\n\r\nThe white dwarf (WD) star in cataclysmic variables (CVs) and related binaries accumulates (accretes) hydrogen-rich gas from a very close sun-like star. This transferred gas, which carries angular momentum, forms a bright, swirling accretion disk around the WD. This accretion process is highly explosive as matter from the disk shears first into the WD surface layers bringing mass, energy and spin into the WD. The physics of this process is very poorly understood and until recently no direct spectroscopic observations of the WD were possible. However, during the quiescent intervals between the outbursts of dwarf novae and the low brightness states of nova-like variables, when the mass transfer rate is very low, the WD radiation can be directly detected. This is because the inner accretion disk is either much less prominent or absent.  Model atmospheres will be used to compare computer-generated spectra with observed spectra to determine WD surface temperatures, surface gravities, rotation rates, spinup, heating, cooling, and chemical abundances of their accreted atmospheres. In order to interpret this expanding body of empirical CV WD properties, a theoretical framework on how the WD responds to the injection of mass, energy and angular momentum is being constructed.  This theory framework is based upon the use of computer codes that produce time-dependent evolutionary WD model sequences in one dimension and two dimensions under conditions of time-variable accretion. The theoretical models, together with the derived empirical properties of CV WDs, will provide answers to the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1) What are the physics, energy budget, heating depth and Kelvin time of accretion heating by downward photon irradiation, compression, and shear mixing of disk matter into the WD?\r\n\r\n(2) How much spinup of the WD occurs through angular momentum transfer by the accreting disk gas?\r\n\r\n(3) When matter is added only in the equatorial region of the WD, how does the heating with latitude and with depth compare with spherical accretion, i.e. how accurate are the 1D accretion studies? Does an accretion belt form and, if so, what is its surface area, depth, and spindown timescale?\r\n\r\n(4) Do accretion belts formed via tangential disk accretion explain the weak or missing boundary layer luminosity (where the accreting gas first interacts with the WD), that is observed in most CVs?\r\n\r\n(5) How much accretion heating of the WD has occurred since the onset of CV evolution? What are typical CV lifetimes? Do CVs evolve across the observed orbital period gap between periods of 2 and 3 hours?\r\n\r\n(6) What is the physical interpretation of the observed distribution of CV WD rotational velocities? How do their cooling rates compare with single white dwarfs? Do WDs in non-magnetic CVs cool differently than magnetic ones? \r\n\r\n(7)  What is the global picture of CV WD properties and evolution from the standpoint of their surface temperatures, luminosities, rotational velocities, and chemical abundance patterns versus accretion rate, CV subtype and orbital period?\r\n\r\nThe results from the research carried out in this project will provide physical insights on tangential (disk) accretion in cataclysmic variable star systems.  The results may also provide important applications in the broader context of (equatorial) accretion flows onto central compact objects in other accreting binaries and disk accreting objects.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
