These investigations have been merging over the past\r\ndecades with developments in set theory and recursion theory; however, their\r\nspecial emphasis on broad philosophical issues has remained prominent.  The\r\nsymposium was timed to coincide with the 70th birthday of one of the guiding\r\nspirits of foundational research over the past four decades, Solomon Feferman,\r\nwhich served further to focus attention on where we have been in this effort\r\nand on where we may be going.  Participation by graduate students was of\r\nobvious importance to the latter.  The efforts of the organizers to prepare\r\na detailed agenda and widely representative program were rewarded by a\r\nstrikingly successful symposium, and the proceedings volume that will appear\r\nin due course promises to be a valuable and influential resource for the\r\ncommunity for years to come.\r\n***\r\n",
