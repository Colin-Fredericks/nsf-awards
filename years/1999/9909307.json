 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n9909307\r\nBROWN\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs (NSF/OPP) has sponsored a Request For Proposal issued under the identification CPO-98-016, \"National Science Foundation Satellite Ground and Space Operations for Telecommunications to Remote Locations.\"  The purpose of this solicitation is to provide expanded satellite telecommunications services in support of the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) that have been previously supplied under NSF assistance grants.  The increased importance of satellite communications to both the science research program and operational USAP support mission at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and an increase in scope of support services anticipated require NSF to change the method of service acquisition from an assistance grant to a full contract.  A significant escalation in scope requires the telemetry, command, and flight operations of the GOES-3 satellite, once acquired by NSF/OPP under agreement with the Department of Commerce, NOAA, for the transfer of the GOES-3 satellite to NSF control.\r\n\r\nNSF/OPP and the NSF Contracts and Policy Oversight Division (NSF/CPO) have received a justification for other than open and full competition (JOFOC) from the NSF Competition Advocate that permits the issuance of a sole source contract to the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (UM/RSMAS), the established provider of satellite communications services to South Pole Station via multiple prior assistance grants.  UM/RSMAS has extensive expertise with the Government provided ATS-3, LES-9, and GOES-3 satellites, to include related telecommand and flight operations experience with ATS-3 under a separate NASA contract.  Following a mandatory Commerce Business Daily announcement of intent, no alternative sources were identified.\r\n\r\nA five year contract period, consisting of one base year with four one-year renewal options, has been negotiated with UM/RSMAS.  The contract will be managed as a cost-reimbursement contract that will utilize annual program plans to define the actual level of effort and cost for each option year.  The pricing proposal accepted by NSF consists of contract Year 1 at a cost of $663,289.  Out-year estimates for Years 2-3 are $816,891, $716,352, $746,024, and $760,713 (sequentially) for an estimated five year total of $3,703,269. \r\n\r\nIt is recommended that a letter contract be issued initially in order to assure continuity of service from the expiring grant.  Restrictions limit initial letter contract awards to 50% of the first year cost.  Two FY 1999 funding awards are anticipated to cover Year 1 costs for the periods of June-October and November-December (1999).  The second increment is recommended to allow continuity of service while administrative processing one additional contract Year 1 FY 2000 funding increment at the start of the new Fiscal Year.  Incremental funding is therefore recommended, and an initial award of $323,134 is recommended for FY 1999 funding to cover the period June-October of the base year cost of $663,289.\r\n\r\n",
