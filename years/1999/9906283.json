 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDemolishing of prestressed concrete is difficult due to the energy stored\r\nin the prestressing metal tendons which is usually up to 125,000 pounds. In\r\nunbonded tendons the energy may be catastrophically released, threatening\r\nthe safety of people, workers and buildings. Most of all flat plate\r\nconstruction and bridge girders produced utilize tensioning of metal\r\ntendons; so the problem is large and it most improtantly it is unresolved. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this research are to develop and to test means of\r\nrestraining or rebonding the tendons under stress for continued effective\r\nload transfer during use and for safe demolition.  The proposed research\r\napproach consists of four activities. 1) We will develop information on the\r\nforces available in prestressed members and calculate the countervailing\r\nforces needed to be supplied by the release mechanism and materials. 2)\r\nLarge scale laboratory testing will be done on the proposed systems.\r\nStrucutral tie downs and tensioning devices will be used. 3) Full scale\r\nprestressed girders will be tested using the rebonding system. 4) the data\r\nwill be evaluated and disseminated.\r\n\r\nThe impact on education should be large. This project should employ an\r\nestimated 25-30 different students from both undergraduate and graduate\r\nlevels. They will be active in all aspects of the project. The proportion\r\nof women gaining that experience should be high, approximately half or more.",
