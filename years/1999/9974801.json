 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Missouri in Saint Louis will acquire an upgrade of an existing 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas, including a) the study of reactions of bimetallic complexes; b) the chemistry of linked metalloborane clusters; c) reactions of small molecules with larger metalloborane clusters; d) dehydrocoupling of hydrosilanes promoted by transition metals; e) synthesis and structural studies of arene oxides & dioxides; f) synthetic applications of (arene)-ruthenium (II) complexes; and g) synthesis and reactions of chiral, non-racemic allylic hydroxy phosphonates.\r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.  Results from these NMR studies are useful in furthering our understanding of catalysis.\r\n",
