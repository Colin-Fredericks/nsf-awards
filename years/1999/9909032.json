The primary objectives of the program are to: (1) Develop and maintain successful recruitment and retention programs for underrepresented groups within the SMET disciplines, (2) Increase partnerships with high schools, academic institutions, corporations and industrial/government laboratories, (3) Strengthen the current PVAMU SMET education and research infrastructure, (4) Ensure students are informed and prepared to transition from high school, through the undergraduate curricula, to graduate schools and industry, and (5) Complement the HRD Comprehensive Partnership for Mathematics and Science Achievement (CPMSA) at the Beaumont Independent School District. The methods to be employed involve establishing processes, with evaluation criteria and responsible persons, to ensure success of the overall program. The processes will support three major components - recruitment and retention, student development and support, and exodus to graduate schools and the SMET workforce. The processes will institute the following activities: (1) Collaboration and synchronization of university recruitment activities, (2) Establishing and maintaining tutorials and mentoring sessions, (3) Integrating and facilitating student learning enrichment opportunities within the university research and corporate partnership programs, (4) Enhancing faculty skills in teaching, research and service, (5) Establishing and utilizing advisory boards from the SMET community, and (6) Conduct program reviews to assess the progress and success of program objectives. Overall, the program will greatly enhance the university human and resource development infrastructure within the SMET disciplines in the following capacities: (1) Building partnerships and synergism between high schools, universities and the SMET workforce, (2) Establishing an infrastructure with the greatest potential for student enrollment and success, (3) Fostering faculty development and curriculum alignment to better serve the various SMET communities, and (4) Developing a system of processes and evaluation procedures which will continue beyond the proposed life of the grant.\r\n",
