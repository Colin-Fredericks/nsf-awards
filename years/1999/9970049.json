The groups in question can be viewed as the\r\nautomorphism groups of unramified coverings of a fixed algebraic curve \r\nover a finite field which is also fixed throughout the discussion. \r\nAs we let vary the coverings we obtain a system of groups, which is\r\ncalled the algebraic fundamental group of the curve; this concept was \r\nintroduced by Grothendieck. The algebraic fundamental group mixes in\r\na fascinating way the arithmetic of the finite field and the geometry\r\nof the curve in question. In particular, one can associate to a\r\npoint on the curve a certain conjugacy class in this group, consisting\r\nof the so-called Frobenius elements. The question which we would like\r\nto answer is: What is the (relative) position of these Frobenius elements\r\nin the group? \r\n\r\nThe general area of research of the project is Arithmetic Algebraic\r\nGeometry.  Roughly speaking, the Algebra refers to the fact that we\r\nwork mainly with polynomials as far as functions are concerned.\r\nWe define geometric objects byequating to zero a few of these \r\npolynomials. Such an object is called an algebraic set or a variety. \r\nIt turns out that there is a surprisingly rich geometry of these \r\nobjects, especially if we consider equations in higher dimensions \r\nand of higher degree. The arithmetical aspect comes into play \r\nwhen we consider only those polynomials which have integers\r\n(or rational numbers) as coefficients.  These objects have wide-ranging\r\napplications in number theory, geometry, and the theory of data security.\r\n",
