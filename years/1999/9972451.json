 "awd_abstract_narration": "The teaching of biology has been undergoing a paradigm shift; from rote memorization in lecture to collaborative problem solving; from \"cook-book\" laboratories to inquiry-based laboratory experiences. The goal of this grant is to develop two upper-level undergraduate Biology courses the University - Animal Physiology and Neurobiology - that use concepts and paradigms from experimental research to improve student understanding of and ability to solve physiological problems, and to enhance student understanding about research. Each course will integrate the design and interpretation of experimental research into laboratory, lecture and problems sets, making appropriate use of both recent technology and traditional approaches. In laboratory the guiding principle will be to reproduce all aspects of research with an appropriate level of direction, including selection of experimental problem, hypothesis formation, experimental design, data collection and analysis, and communication of results. The number of laboratories, both human and animal, will be limited to three to allow necessary time to explore both the experimental process and the scientific content. A feature of the laboratories will be complementary use of computer simulations and \"hands on\" experiments. Students will first use computer simulations to test their hypotheses and acquaint themselves with underlying physiological content and then conduct similar \"hands on\" experiments, in which their experience with simulations will allow them to focus on technical success. In lecture, both the principles and their underlying experimental basis will be taught, using computer animation to illustrate experimental design and methods. Problem sets will reinforce and integrate concepts from lecture and laboratory, using experimental design as a setting for collaborative problem solving. These courses may help bridge the gap between introductory biology courses lacking in research and problem solving, and original independent student research in faculty laboratories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
