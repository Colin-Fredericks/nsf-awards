 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have found, as have others, that traditional teaching methods in physics often do not lead to good conceptual understanding, therefore we are revising our courses so that they focus on active student engagement .  We are developing an integrated infrastructure for our two-course calculus-based introductory physics sequence.  In this sequence,  Six Ideas That Shaped Physics, (Moore) is adapted and implemented to foster student understanding of basic physical concepts through class time devoted to active, cooperative learning.  To further enhance student learning, we are developing and documenting an on-line database indexed by physics topic and chapter in Moore's book,  a complete set of  interactive demonstrations and \"discovery\" style microcomputer-based-laboratories adapting and implementing from Tools for Scientific Thinking (the Universal Lab Interface, and MacMotion, Data Logger, and the ULI Timer), developed by R. Thornton, et al. at Tufts University,  and Workshop Physics Tools, developed by P. Laws, et al. at Dickinson College.  The demonstrations are participatory so that the students are engaged in a \"minds-on\" manner and the laboratory experiments fully embrace the \"discovery\" mode of thinking.  The students are guided in formulating hypotheses and in their understanding on how to analyze data. The demonstrations and experiments are coordinated with the text and with each other to provide students with an integrated and coherent whole. The goal of this project is for our students to develop a good conceptual and concrete understanding of basic physics and of how one uses data to develop and test theories.   Our assessment  focuses on learning outcomes using nationally recognized standardized tests to assess our students' learning.",
