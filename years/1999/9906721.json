The project will investigate   \"air sparging\", a popular method of remediating groundwater and soil contaminated with volatile organic compounds.  Remediation effectiveness is largely determined by the location and geometry of subsurface airflow pathways, which in turn are controlled by site conditions, such as grain-size distribution and stratigraphic heterogeneity.  The research goals are 1: To quantitatively and qualitatively define the hydrogeologic parameters necessary for the successful use of air sparging in the remediation industry, 2: To develop a predictive model to facilitate its use at appropriate sites without the need for expensive and inconclusive pilot studies.  This will be accomplished by a tripartite approach of laboratory, computer modeling and field observation.  Laboratory observations will be used to validate and modify a multiphase-flow model (MISER), which in turn will be calibrated to a well-studied field site.  Undergraduate research students will participate, and project results and methodologies will be incorporated into environmental science and engineering curricula at Hope College and the University of Michigan. \r\n",
