 "awd_abstract_narration": "Auburn University's Physics Department will host 10 undergraduate physics student for 10 weeks during the summer in a \"Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site\".  During that time each student will complete a research project and then present the results during the subsequent academic year at either the National Conference on Undergraduate Research or an appropriate professional meeting.  The objectives are (1) to expose undergraduate students to a thriving research environment, (2) encourage them to pursue careers in science, (3) reach out to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and (4) teach students to work on team-oriented projects.  The research projects are carefully designed to be challenging but to ensure the possibility of completion during the 10 week summer period.  The projects are integral parts of the research efforts in the physics Department guaranteeing interaction and communication among the faculty, postdocs, resident students, and the REU student(s) working in the group.  Projects span the gamut of research activities in the Physics Department including many with experimental and some with theoretical emphasis.  The principal areas are solid state physics, plasma physics, and space physics.",
