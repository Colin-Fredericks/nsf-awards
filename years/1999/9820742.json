 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, carried out by Professor Robert Corn at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program, uses surface spectroscopies to characterize ultrathin biopolymer films at solid/liquid interfaces.  The biopolymers studied include synthetic polypeptides, oligonucleotides with modified bases, polypeptides with derivatized individual amino acids, and surface polymerized polypeptide multilayers.  Biopolymer thin films on gold surfaces are used as substrates so that the surface is conductive, and so that surface plasmon resonance spectrometry is used to characterize the thin film on the surface.  Surface FTIR, fluorescence measurements, and contact angle and imaging SPR spectroscopies are also used to establish the nature of the thin biopolymer film.  New attachment strategies (amine and/or thiol coupling methods) are explored.  In an exciting potential application,  isolated DNA-based molecules on surfaces will be used as a means of encoding information on surfaces.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding of the attachment of thin films of biomolecules to metal surfaces, and the means to characterize the structures of the thin films, underlies much research in biosensors, medical implants, artificial biostructures, and basic materials science.  Professor Corn will study central issues of this attachment and structural characterization, using complementary surface spectroscopies to establish the structure and shape of the natural and modified biomolecules attached to surfaces.  In so doing, their mechanisms of action will become better understood.   In an exciting potential application,  isolated DNA-based molecules on surfaces will be used as a means of encoding information on surfaces.",
