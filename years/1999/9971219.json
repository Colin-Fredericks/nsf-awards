In collaboration with Professor Robert Bieri\r\n(Frankfurt, Germany) he is investigating new topological properties of\r\nan arbitrary action by a group G on a \"non-positively curved\" space M.\r\nThey have introduced the idea of n-connectedness of the action over M\r\nand have found that this is an open condition on the space of all such\r\nactions.  For actions with discrete orbits they have identified their\r\nconditions as equivalent to well-known finiteness properties of\r\nstabilizers of points in M thus proving that these are also open\r\nproperties.  Previous work of many authors on a restricted case\r\nsuggests that this should be a promising line of investigation, bringing\r\ntopological methods into algebra in a new way.  They have set their\r\nsights on a test case, the Moebius action of SL(2, Z[1/m]) on the\r\nhyperbolic plane (for a positive integer m).  They conjecture that the\r\namount of connectvity is directly related to the number of prime\r\nfactors of m, and they propose to prove this among other things.  In\r\ncollaboration with Professor Andrew  Nicas (McMaster, Canada) Professor\r\nGeoghegan will continue his study of parametrized fixed point theory\r\nand its relationship to non-singular flows.  They hope to elucidate the\r\ngeometrical meaning of some K-theoretic  torsions which have been\r\ndefined for such flows.  They have already achieved part of that\r\nprogram but more remains to be done.\r\n\r\nMathematics involves various styles or forms of thought.  Among these\r\nare the geometrical (or visual) and the algebraic (or discrete).  For\r\nexample, \"discrete group theory\" (the formal study of symmetries) has\r\ntraditionally been part of abstract algebra.  But fruitful advances in\r\nour understanding of symmetries have been made in recent years through\r\ngeometrizing this kind of algebra.  One way of doing this is through\r\nthe notion of \"fundamental group of a topological space\".  If the\r\ntopological space is chosen wisely, much about the algebra of the group\r\nwhich was previously invisible and unknown becomes clear through\r\napplying the very old and deep field of \"algebraic topology\" to the\r\ngroup being studied, via this space.  The study of symmetries is basic\r\nin many applications of mathematics, particularly to physics. This\r\napproach is being used in the present proposal to better understand the\r\ninterplay of group theory with geometry and number theory (in the part\r\nwith Bieri) and with flows in dynamics (in the part with Nicas).\r\n",
