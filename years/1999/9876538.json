All the tasks will be accompanied by scoring guides and sample student responses.\r\n\r\nThe bank will be available on a website with three levels of security:  public (open to anyone who logs on); and school and external assessment levels who agree to certain conditions of use.\r\n\r\nThe project will also have a research component where the analytic framework developed by Glaser and Baxter for science assessments will be extended to mathematics.  They will focus on two issues:  (1) the match or mismatch between the intentions of task developers and the nature of the cognitive activity elicited by the task; and  (2) the correspondence between the quality of the cognitive activity and the ways in which student performance is scored and evaluated.  Findings will be applied to the development of tasks for the bank, and presented in other venues.\r\n\r\n",
