 "awd_abstract_narration": "9903036\r\nSpear\r\nTrace element distribution between coexisting minerals have been\r\ndemonstrated to reveal aspects of the history of rocks that are not\r\nrecorded by major elements. This arises because of (1) the relatively slow\r\ndiffusivity of trace elements in minerals such as garnet, (2) the extreme\r\npartitioning behavior of many trace elements, and (3) the sensitivity of\r\ntrace element concentrations to small amounts of reaction progress or P-T\r\nchanges. This study seeks to explore the application of trace element\r\ngeochemistry in metamorphic rocks towards a deeper understanding of Earth\r\nhistory.\r\n\tSuites of rocks from several well-characterized localities will be\r\nexamined for trace element zoning in garnet and coexisting minerals.\r\nObserved zoning patterns will be correlated with the distribution and\r\ncompositions of accessory phases such as xenotime, monazite, zircon,\r\napatite and allanite. The zoning patterns will be explained in terms of the\r\nwhole-rock reaction history and the temperature dependence of trace element\r\npartitioning between garnet and accessory phases will be calibrated using\r\nP-T conditions inferred from other thermobarometers.\r\n\tThe results of this research will provide new, detailed insights\r\ninto the geologic evolution of the areas studied and will, more generally,\r\nprovide new tools for the petrologist to apply to the unveiling of Earth\r\nhistory\r\n",
