The symposium brings researchers from diverse communities such as physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and engineering together to discuss issues in this highly interdisciplinary field.  The meeting focuses on interfaces which are important in such phenomena as catalysis and stabilization of nanostructures.  The interface of clusters and nanostructures with biological systems will also be discussed.\r\n\r\nFunds for this symposium are provided by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences Office of Multidisciplianry Activities, the Division of Chemistry, the Division of Physics, the Division of Materials Research and the Chemical and Thermal Systems Division in the Engineering Directorate.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award provides funding, primarily in support of young scientists, for the International Symposium on Cluster and Nanostructure Interfaces to be held in Richmond, VA, on October 25-28, 1999.
