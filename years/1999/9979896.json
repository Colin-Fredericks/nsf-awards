 "awd_abstract_narration": "Univ. of Virgin Islands\r\n\r\nThe Division of Science and Mathematics at the University of the Virgin Islands seeks to become a center for excellence for the preparation of minority scientists, mathematicians and engineers. Cornerstones for achieving this goal are already in place: a dedicated science and mathematics faculty with a successful record of mentoring undergraduate students in SMET fields; a large pool of motivated minority students with outstanding potential; and the commitment of the University's administration to substantial revitalization of the science and mathematics programs.\r\n\r\nThrough the NSF HBCU Undergraduate Program, UVI will:\r\n1. increase the number of under-represented minority students majoring in SMET disciplines through early intervention in junior high and high schools. Students will get excited about science and mathematics through explorations which will encourage conjecture and proof.\r\n2. support faculty research, which will in turn support research with undergraduate students. The research infrastructure will be supported, while introducing world-class research opportunities to the UVI students and faculty.\r\n3. introduce all science and mathematics students to the rewards of research through an innovative research-infused curriculum;\r\n4. provide an avenue for students to participate in additional research through summer programs and scholarships during the year which require involvement in a research project;\r\n5. offer Virgin Islanders an affordable means of acquiring a degree in engineering while creating ties with Columbia University and Washington University in St. Louis.\r\n6. provide support for successful entry into SMET graduate programs through a strong\r\nundergraduate curriculum and adequate GRE preparation.\r\n\r\nThe above multi-pronged approach to the solution is indicative of the problems that we face in the US Virgin Islands. The University, in its role as the only provider of higher education in the VI, must provide leadership in these areas.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of the planned activities will yield an increase in the number and quality of students that attend and successfully enter and complete graduate programs in science, mathematics, engineering and technology fields. The curriculum, the atmosphere, and the increased mentoring and guidance will increase opportunities for students in science and mathematics to pursue graduate study.\r\n\r\nUVI Division of Science and mathematics will be a model for successful science and mathematics programs. This proposal has the support of all members of the division and the administration. The division is committed to being at the forefront of pedagogical issues in science and mathematics and will make research the unifying theme throughout the curriculum.\r\n",
