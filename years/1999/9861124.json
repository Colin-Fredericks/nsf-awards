In its short history, most of the SDR development has been for military and personal communicator applications.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Ameranth Technology Systems seeks to attain an industrial/commercial goal, i.e., to develop a family of low-cost interoperating radios for data input and display in the warehousing and material management environments, with embedments of voice communications and system commands, data transceiving, and single-frame video interchange.  The radio architecture is based on a demonstrated and successful system using precedent silicon technology.  For this proposed work, an advanced, highly integrated radio chip set will be \"opened up\" to allow complete access to the software \"hooks\" for software definition of the radio functions by the operator.  In Phase I, Ameranth Technology will design the system based on its prior subsystem elements, using software control of low-cost wireless-telephone silicon to perform all the functions of a half-dozen large and generally very expensive single-purpose radios.  In the next phase of the research, a system family of radios will be built and tested in a demonstration prototype.\r\n     The project proffers broadly redefinable radio subsystems that can be mixed and matched to each other and to the external (cellular phone) world to enable a very low-cost, readily proliferous system for real-time accounting and control of operations now controlled by rivers of paper.  Specific market niches for the equipment are hospitality, retail, and defense.",
