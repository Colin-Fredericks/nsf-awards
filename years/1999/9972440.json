Inference about a scalar parameter of interest in the\r\npresence of nuisance parameters can be achieved by using the signed root\r\nof the likelihood ratio statistic, which has the standard normal\r\ndistribution asymptotically. In situations where the number of nuisance\r\nparameters is large or the sample size is small, the standard normal\r\napproximation to the distribution of the signed root can be inaccurate.\r\nConsiderable progress has been made recently in understanding the\r\nstatistical properties of the signed root and in constructing analytical\r\nmodifications to the signed root that improve the accuracy of the normal\r\napproximation. Unfortunately, the modifications can be challenging to\r\nimplement routinely, because they require elusive constructs, such as\r\nancillary statistics, or they involve complicated analytical\r\ncalculations, such as taking expectations of higher-order derivatives of\r\nthe log likelihood function. In contrast to the use of analytical\r\nmodifications, the proposed research focuses on the development of\r\nsimulation methods to refine distributional approximations. These\r\nparametric-bootstrap techniques are attractive for their conceptual\r\nsimplicity and very broad applicability. However, for the simulation\r\nmethods to be valid, they must offer the same desirable attributes that\r\nthe analytical modifications possess, with regard to such key statistical\r\nconcepts as ancillarity and large-deviation behavior. A crucial component\r\nof the proposed research is to assess the statistical qualities of the\r\nsimulation methods, particularly compared to those of the analytical\r\nmodifications.  Other aspects of the proposed research involve extending\r\nthe simulation methods to models where standard asymptotic behavior\r\nfails, such as models involving random effects, and to circumstances\r\nwhere genuine likelihoods are unavailable but pseudo-likelihoods can be\r\ndevised.   \r\n",
