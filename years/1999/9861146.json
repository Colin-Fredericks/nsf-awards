 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861146\r\n     This small business innovation Phase I research project concerns flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) of mixed metal precursors in EtOH to produce low cost, mixed metal oxide nanopowders (n powders), with controlled particle size, phase, chemical purity and high surface areas. FSP production of >250 g/h mullite (3Al,O,,2SiO,), P\" alumna (Li,,.,,Na, .67AII0.67017)' strontium aluminosilicate (SrO'AI,O,'2SiO,) and CeO, n powders has been proven. As produced powders are unagglomerated, often single crystals with 10 to 100 nm ave. particle sizes and surface areas of 120 to 10 rn~/g. Tal Materials proposes to use FSP to develop new, low cost routes to ZrO/CeO, and PrO~CeO, for automotive three way catalysts (TWCs). FSP provides the potential to produce high surface area, sinter resistant n powders with tailored composition in a single step. The Phase II objectives are to: (1) define how SP process variables and metal ratios control phase and phase purity, particle size and size distribution, and catalytic (oxygen storage capacity) properties of ZrO~CeO, and PrO~CeO, n powders; (2) identify compositions that offer superior catalytic activity with resistance to sintering, and (3) establish FSP design parameters required to scale up to 10 kg/h of n powders. Phase II objectives will be to use Phase I data to: (1) scale up production of n powders to 20 to 50 kg/day; (2) expand the scope of materials reduced to develop new and advanced TWC products; (3) develop related doped n CeO, for other applications, ie. for fuel cells.\r\n     Currently, the multimillion dollar U.S. Automotive TWC components market is served entirely by non U.S. suppliers (e.g. Rhone Poulenc). Tal Materials, proposes to extend its expertise in the production of mixed metal nanopowders, to produce new, low cost high surface area, sinter resistant and tailored Zr/Ce and Pr/Ce oxide n powders for TWC applications. Tal Materials will work with local Michigan Industry to become a U.S. supplier of TWC components. Expertise developed in the process will provide a new market for Tal and the potential to develop products for related markets, e.g. in solid oxide fuel cells.\r\n",
