 "awd_abstract_narration": "Migrant workers from the islands of the Caribbean enter North American cities seeking work to obtain income that the small, open economies of their homelands are unable to provide.  Some of these migrants choose to stay in New York, Toronto, and other large cities, while others work only long enough to save the money needed to return home, and others plan to return to their homelands upon retirement.  The movement of workers between the islands and North American cities has created a particular kind of circuit migration, often based on the life-cycle of individuals.  This doctoral dissertation research project explores the strategies transnational migrants have adopted to extend the borders of their small island nations, thereby increasing their economic opportunities while maintaining important ties to their homelands.  Special attention will focus on the impact of a particular type of land tenure known as family land in the construction and maintenance of transnational migrant networks.  The family land tenure system is based on the fact that all members of a family inherit equal shares of the land.  In addition to fostering the flow of money in the form of remittance payments, the system provides a place where migrants can return and acts as a bond between generations.  This project will focus on a case study of a transnational community based the island of Carriacou in the nation of Grenada, where there is an unusually large amount of family land.  Special attention will be given to examining how growing demand from non-residents coupled with increased land values has caused friction within the native community by accentuating the difference between family members who would want to divide and sell family land holdings and those who choose not to do so.  Data gathered through questionnaires, in depth interviews, focus groups, and oral histories in Carriacou, New York, and Toronto will be analyzed to shed light on the ways that Carriacoans at home and abroad view land and land ownership.  Data also will be acquired to update baseline data on land use and land tenure gathered by the doctoral candidate on the island in 1985.  This project will enhance understandings of land-tenure systems, migration networks, and the responses of traditional institutions to increased external pressures.  It also will increase knowledge about the ways that geographic location influences the on the perceptions and behavior of people.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
