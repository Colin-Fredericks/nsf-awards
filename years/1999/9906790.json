The proposed research focuses on algorithms and systems that enable MEMS to perform distributed manipulation tasks, taking on the challenge of design, control, and programming of massively-parallel arrays of microactuators. Arrays of MEMS devices can move and\r\nposition tiny parts, such as integrated circuit chips, in flexible and predictable ways by oscillatory or ciliary action. The theory of programmable force fields can model this action, leading to algorithms for powerful and general micromanipulation strategies. \r\nThe proposed research will develop new algorithms and new MEMS systems for massively parallel distributed manipulation. This entails the design, fabrication, and control of new MEMS devices, together with the design, construction, and programming of new control systems, algorithms, and software for task-level manipulation. The PI's team will investigate algorithms and systems for part orientation, singulation, sorting, and posing. They will extend the theory of programmable vector fields, develop universal feeder-orienter devices, exploit sensor feedback, and investigate closed loop control algorithms, online algorithms, and distributed, local control of ciliary arrays. Finally, the PI's team will explore the application of massively parallel systems and force fields to structural biology and human augmentation.\r\n",
