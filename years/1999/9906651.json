New nonlinear inverse scattering methods were developed to account for multiple scattering effects within the scattering object. The Born-iterative method (BIM) and distorted-Born-iterative method (DBIM) were developed that demonstrated the inversion of objects with contrasts as great as 10:1 and exhibited super-resolution on the order of 0.1 wavelengths for EZ (TM) polarized wave. Another new technique known as the local-shape-function (LSP) method was developed to perform inverse scattering on metallic scatterers, for HZ (TE) polarized waves, and variable density acoustic waves, where previous methods failed to produce a convergent solution due to extremely strong nonlinearities and Green's function singularity. More recently, the frequency hopping approach where large scatterers with high contrasts can be reconstructed, have been developed. Furthermore, preliminary three-dimensional inverse scattering result has been obtained\r\n.\r\n The need to invert very large scattering objects stimulated research in fast forward scattering solvers. These fast algorithms solve the scattering problem exactly and achieve computational savings by exploiting inherent redundancies in the scattering calculations. The first of these are recursive algorithms (RATMA, RTMA) that solve the scattering problem valid for all incidence sources in 0(N2) operations by exploiting translational properties of wave phenomenon. The new algorithm (NEPAL) instead uses the surface equivalence principle resulting in an 0 (N1.5) algorithm that is amenable to parallel pro-cessing. This algorithm has been generalized to three dimensions. Recently, various fast iterative solvers have been developed that furnish the solution for one excitation in 0(N log N) operations and using 0(N) memory. They involve the use of fast multipole method, and various methods to diagonalize the translation operator.\r\n\r\nThe current proposal is to continue developing new nonlinear inverse scattering theo-ries with special emphasis on three-dimensional scatterers. The investigators plan to move away from the Born-type methods and exploit new ways of parameterizing the scattering object in order to achieve the best possible reconstruction. They will use their progress in fast forward scattering solvers as building blocks to speed up the inversion and solve much larger objects and three-dimension-objects. Other means of solving large objects, particularly objects buried in a slowly varying inhomogeneous background would be investigated as well. Finally, they wish to develop new experimental apparatus that can achieve high-fidelity measurements so that the super-resolution phenomenon can be verified experimentally.  \r\n***  \r\n",
