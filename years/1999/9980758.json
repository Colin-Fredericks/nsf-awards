Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that both the photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) of these multi layer structures respond reversibly and robustly to amino acids in buffered aqueous solution. In Phase One of the project, die chips grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) will be prepared with varying layer dimensions and chemical compositions in order to optimize EL and PL responses to a variety of aqueous test analytes, including amino acids, oligopeptides, and (metallo)porphyrins. Coatings will be applied to the surfaces of the die chips to enhance the selectivity of the response to certain anal ytes. In Phase Two, self-aligned structures will be prepared by chemically etching a trench of micron-scale width into the die chip. One side of this trench-divided structure can be placed in forward bias, yielding EL, and the other side of the structure can be placed in reverse bias to detect the EL as photocurrent. This creates a self-aligned integrated LED/Detector structure. Adsorption of aqueous analytes onto the uncoated or coated trench walls of these structures will be determined as a function of concentration and in the presence of various dissolved gases. Use of the structure for spectrophotometric analysis will be investigated. Numerical modeling of the electro-optical responses will guide the optimized construction of these integrated sensors. In Phase Three, a 5x5 array of the self-aligned LED/Detector structures will be prepared, and fluid flow of analyte solutions will be modeled. By using different coatings on the array elements, a multicomponent analysis of a mixture of analytes will be undertaken to demonstrate the versatility of the sensor structure. A variation of the sensor based on diode lasers will be investigated. Graduate and undergraduate students participating in this project will benefit from exposure to interdisciplinary research with sensor-driven applications that embrace chemistry and biochemistry, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering. A base of instructional materials derived from the materials and devices employed in this work will be expanded, and a website for the project developed.\r\n",
