Thus, in a string of \r\nsounds where we would expect the linear ordering of two sounds to be \r\n...xy..., we find instead ...yx....  While less common than processes \r\nsuch as assimilation or sound deletion, regular metathesis nonetheless \r\noccurs as a regular phonological process in synchronic systems  cross-\r\nlinguistically, thus countering the commonly-held view of metathesis as \r\nsporadic and irregular. Moreover, preliminary research suggests that by \r\ntaking into account considerations of perceptual ease, a unified account \r\nof the motivation behind a wide range of metatheses is possible. \r\nHowever, basic knowledge is lacking concerning the full range of \r\nmetatheses that are possible in synchronic systems, under what \r\nconditions metathesis applies, whether perceptual factors are able to \r\naccount for all cases, and how metathesis interacts with other processes \r\naffecting sound structure.  This information is critical to the \r\ndevelopment of a predictive theory of metathesis. It is also of crucial \r\nimportance for the advancement of phonological theory since without a \r\nclear understanding of the fundamental phonological processes possible \r\nin human language, developing an explanatory theory of sound systems \r\nis impossible. The goal of this project is thus two-fold: first, to compile \r\na comprehensive database of attested metathesis cases; and second, to \r\ndevelop a predictive and constrained theory of metathesis.   \r\n\r\n",
