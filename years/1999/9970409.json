The investigator is continuing to explore theoretical and practical problems related to the number field sieve.  He is also continuing his research into the fundamental computational tools in one-dimensional commutative algebra, including fast Fourier transforms and fast power series exponentiation.\r\n\r\n\"Today, a small group of technically sophisticated people could disrupt the computers and the Internet connections on which our finance, telecommunications, power, water systems, emergency service systems all depend,\" says Jamie S.  Gorelick, Vice Chair of Fannie Mae and Co-Chair of the Advisory Committee of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection.  \"Cyberspace is likely to be the next battlefield for this nation.\"  The investigator's work is directly relevant to public-key cryptography, including public-key signature systems, the main tool for protecting the integrity of Internet communications.  The investigator's research shows precisely how long it would take an attacker to break the most popular public-key systems; this information is crucial for users who want to choose safe systems.  The investigator's research also reduces the amount of computer time necessary to use these systems.  The same research is useful in many other computer problems, including medical image processing.\r\n",
