 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Norman Hammond, MS Chantal Esquivias will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Her research will focus on the Postclassic period on the Southern Veracruz Gulf coast of Mexico and she will supplement her prior archaeological survey with stratigraphic excavation. She will also conduct archival study in Seville Spain. During the Postclassic period, which ended with the arrival of the Spanish, the Mayan peoples moved away from large temple centers and broke down into smaller groups. At the same time the Aztec empire arose in the highlands of Central Mexico and extended its influence over a broad area. Archaeologists wish to understand how such empires function and maintain control over multiple ethnic groups distributed over broad geographic regions. A number of strategies ranging from direct empirical control to looser forms of alliance have been proposed and likely different approaches were employed in different situations. Southern Veracruz lies at, or slightly beyond the boundary of the Aztec empire and MS Esquivias will examine how this area was affected by it. To accomplish this goal she will combine archaeological excavation with archival analysis. Spanish documents describe the social organization of the region at the time of conquest and enumerate land claims and land holdings. On this basis it should be possible to reconstruct many aspects of social and political organization. Archaeological data will allow MS Esquivias to address questions of Aztec influence directly. Very little is known about the Postclassic in this region and she will conduct test excavations at a number of sites to  establish a ceramic sequence. She will search for diagnostic ceramic types and use these to gain insight into Postclassic settlement pattern. From work in other areas, it is known that several kinds of ceramics are Aztec related and the presence or absence of such materials in Southern Veracruz will serve to determine Aztec penetration into this region.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons. It will provide data on a little known region which will be of interest to many archaeologists. It will yield new information on how empires functioned and assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
