 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shaping the Future (NSF 96-139) challenges us to provide science literacy for ALL in a way that emphasizes the processes of science.  It is pedagogically unsound today to teach the sciences in general and chemistry in particular without exposing students to computers and their uses. Our early exposure to the use of laboratory computers for data acquisition and reduction was the LIMSport project (Vitz, Kutztown Univ.). This was a DOS based system that is now evolving under the Windows environment.  A workshop and materials developed through the NSF-sponsored Computers in Chemistry Laboratory Instruction Initiative provided further impetus for this project.\r\n\r\nOur project involves the adaptation of the gains from the NSF supported Computers in the Chemistry Laboratory Instruction Initiative.  Our present work entails the modernization of the introductory chemistry laboratory with data acquisition hardware, sensors, and software.  This modernization enables our students to be better prepared their challenges in the new millennium.  Three introductory chemistry laboratories use the hardware to serve a diverse student population.  In our first-year courses we teach chemistry majors, engineers, other science and pre-health science majors, and nonscience majors. In this group 60% are female and 33% are minority (21% African American) or international.  In General Chemistry Laboratory (CHE L101-L102) we expose students to a balanced mix of experimental experiences: those that primarily involve a computer for data acquisition and reduction; those that require nothing more than a balance, a flask, and a graduated cylinder; and those that are a hybrid of the two.  Engineers confront materials problems in Materials Science Laboratory (CHE/EGR L122). For nonscience majors, experiments in Chemistry and Society Laboratory (CHE L110) use computers to measure the conductivity and pH of environmental water samples, the heat content of some fuels and food, and the spectra of colored solutions.  Our goal for the use of this technology is not only to teach the principles of chemistry, but to excite our students, arouse their curiosity, make them critical thinkers, help them develop problem solving skills, and hopefully encourage them learn more about the sciences in general and chemistry in particular.\r\n",
