 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a planning project to develop a network of ethnographers who study organizations that are substantial users of automated information technology.  In particular, the project focuses on organizations that use information technology to share and improve their understanding of relevant issues in order to meet their organizational goals (knowledge networking).  The project asks whether and how the creation of knowledge and its use may be changing in these technology intensive environments.  In the period of the award, the principal investigator will be recruiting ethnographers from various disciplines to participate in the network, by doing interviews, site visits, and presentations at professional meetings.  Working with an information consultant, the investigator will begin to develop an electronic information infrastructure to support the work of the participants and test the approaches that organizations are using. One or more workshops will be held, at which arrangements for the network and infrastructure will be discussed, and plans for a next-phase effort will be developed.",
