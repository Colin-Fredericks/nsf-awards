 "awd_abstract_narration": "9873575\r\nWalker\r\nSubduction zones, where oceanic plates descend back into the mantle, are major sites of material exchange between the Earth's outer rind and its deep interior.  Before the subducting plate or slab descends 200 kilometers, however, it loses matter via dehydration and/or melting to the overriding plate and, at deeper levels, to the overlying  mantle wedge.  This loss of matter is sometimes referred to as the slab flux and further serves to instigate melting in the mantle wedge. Erupting magmas, stemming from this flux-generated melting, can, if primitive enough in composition, be used as probes of the slab flux.  Moreover, where magmas have been erupted at many locations across a subduction zone, it is possible to examine continuity in the slab flux with varying slab depth.  One ideal modern locale for such an \"across-arc\" investigation is southeastern Guatemala and western El Salvador, where subaerial volcanism stretches continuously some 100 kilometers across the Central American subduction zone.  This study will utilize melt inclusions trapped in early-forming crystals in basic scoria and ash falls to examine variation in the slab flux across an active subduction zone.  Melt inclusions in early-forming crystals often preserve relatively primitive magma compositions, permitting less ambiguous insights into the slab flux. Basic scoria and ash falls, that is, the products of rapid explosive eruptions of relatively primitive compositions themselves, will be utilized, as melt inclusions preserved in their crystals typically have experienced less post-entrapment chemical modification than melt inclusions preserved in crystals in basic lava flows.  Specifically, volatile and trace element determinations on the melt inclusions will be carried out by: 1) Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS);  2) Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS); and  3) Fourier Transform = Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).  Combined volatile and trace element analyses will not only serve to constrain the continuity in the slab flux,  but will also help to better constrain the nature of the melting process occurring in the mantle wedge.\r\n",
