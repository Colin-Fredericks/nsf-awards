 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with problems  arising in the mathematical\r\nmodeling  of strongly heterogeneous materials, primarily composites.\r\nA composite is a mixture of several different  constituent materials or \r\nphases so that it combines the most useful features of each.\r\nFor example, a high thermal conductivity composite consists of ceramic \r\nfiller beads in a  polymeric matrix.  The goal is to maximize thermal conductivity. \r\nCeramic is a very good thermal conductor while the polymer \r\nis not. It is not practical to use pure ceramic since it is too brittle.\r\nHowever, the polymer/ceramic composite is a good thermal conductor and it \r\nhas desirable mechanical properties. The problem in this context is \r\nto optimize strength and thermal conductivity by the correct selection of \r\nthe filler identity, size, shape, and the random size distribution. Tools from\r\nthe mathematical theory of homogenization will be used to attack these questions.\r\nThe three problem areas of the proposed work are the optimization of dielectric and \r\nmechanical properties of epoxy/ceramic composites, with applications to the\r\ndesign of capacitors;  an investigation of dynamical  problems and frequency \r\ndependent effects in transducer materials, with applications to sensors and \r\ntransmitters of acoustic signals; and a study of problems from superconductivity, \r\nsuperfluidity, and liquid crystals, with the goal of understanding mathematical \r\nissues caused by the presence of vortices, nonlinearity, and nonstandard \r\nboundary conditions.\r\n\r\nThe planned work lies at the frontier between mathematics and materials science, \r\nand close collaborations with materials scientists from universities and private industry \r\nwill be carried out.  Mathematics can help to develop new materials with superior \r\nproperties for various industrials needs, verify the reliability of \r\nexperimental data, and devuise efficient ways to compute properties of \r\ndesigner composites. The results of the work in the first of the three areas \r\n(epoxy/ceramic composites) will provide guidance for future directions in \r\nmanufacturing and materials development in various important industrial applications. \r\nTwo typical examples are the  design of new 'packages'  for integrated circuits \r\nwhich remove heat from the electronics more efficiently and significant enhancement \r\nin functionality of capacitors which are used in various electronics products. \r\nThe planned work on transducer materials has immediate applications in underwater \r\nsonar and medical imaging.  The work in the third area (superconductivity) will help  \r\nto clarify which of the existing physical models provide the best way of calculating \r\neffective properties of superconducting thin films  with a large number of vortices, \r\nand it will lead to better models for these phenomena.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
