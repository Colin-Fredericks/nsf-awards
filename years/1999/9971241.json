 "awd_abstract_narration": "Douglas Doren of the University of Delaware is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program  to continue his theoretical studies of semiconductor surface chemistry.  Doren is studying pericyclic reactions of organic molecules at the clean (100) surface of silicon.  He is studying the role of excited surface electronic states in these reactions, and the effect of dopant and alloy atoms on bonding and reactivity.  The method being used is primarily density functional theory, and the surface models include both finite clusters and periodic slabs.  The Diels-Alder reaction will be studied in some detail with the goal of understanding the factors that determine product selectivity and to broaden the class of reagents that can be used in the reaction.  A new class of pericyclic reactions, the 1-3 dipolar additions on Si(100), will also be studied.  This work will explore the thermodynamics and kinetics of these reactions, and characterize spectral properties for comparison with experiment.  Dopants including Ge, B and P on Si surfaces will be used to study the effects of these atoms on binding energies, surface electronic states and activation energies.\r\n\r\nSemiconductor surface chemistry is fundamental to processing the electronic devices that pervade modern life.  As device features reach the nanometer scale, the need for control over device structure at the atomic level is becoming critical.  Chemical processing methods that allow controlled surface modification over macroscopic areas are essential to allow continued, economical reductions in device dimensions.  Both practical and fundamental issues have made semiconductor surface chemistry an active and rapidly growing field.  Doren's research focuses on theoretical studies of reactions on the (100) surface of silicon, the main surface used currently in integrated circuit production.",
