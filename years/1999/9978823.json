 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop on 'Mathematical Foundations of CAD' will be held  at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, Berkeley CA, June 4-5, 1999. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers from the fields of pure and applied mathematics, computational geometry, and computer-aided geometric design, to explore the fundamental unresolved mathematical and computational issues that currently impair the utility and reliability of CAD systems in scientific/engineering applications. Problems with the representation and manipulation of geometry in CAD systems have deep roots in many areas of mathematics, such as algebraic and differential geometry, topology, analysis, and approximation theory. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will help promote discussion and interaction between the CAD and mathematics communities. It will be exploratory in nature, with 'position' papers used to stimulate debate and discussion concerning current needs, possibilities, and promising areas for joint exploration. The anticipated outcomes of the workshop will include: (1) exposing mathematicians to an interesting array of geometry problems motivated by practical CAD needs; (2) imparting to the CAD algorithm developers an idea of the current state-of-the-art in relevant mathematical disciplines; (3) promotion of collaborative projects between researchers in the CAD and mathematics communities; and (4) compilation and publication of the workshop findings in an appropriate forum.  \r\n",
