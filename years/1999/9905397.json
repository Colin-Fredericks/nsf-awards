 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small groups often make decisions involving quantities, such as budget decisions, jury damage awards, and forecasts. These decision-making situations arise frequently in government, business, finance, legal, and other organizational settings. The research supported by this grant aims to provide increased understanding of how group decisions of a quantitative nature are made in organizations. It is expected that no single group decision process will account for group decisions involving every type of quantitative decision task. Rather, differences among decision tasks are expected to result in different group decision processes. Some group decision tasks incorporate beliefs that are shared by a set of group members about what would be appropriate responses. These tasks allow for arguments during discussion that correspond to a particular choice, and are predicted to lead to group decisions that reflect the shared belief. In contrast, decision tasks that involve social attitudes are expected to foster discussion that focuses on reaching agreement among the group members. In these cases, the group interaction should create pressure to reach agreement, and larger factions are expected to dominate the group decision. Still other group judgment tasks lead members to be relatively indifferent to many of the alternatives. In these cases, the group decision process can be summarized as the average of the group member preferences. The average is expected because it efficiently resolves the differences in the group member opinions. Three experiments will test these hypotheses. The theoretical, conceptual, and empirical contributions of this research will deepen our knowledge and understanding of the group processes that ultimately guide the many important decisions that get made in financial, educational, governmental, and legal settings.\r\n \r\n",
