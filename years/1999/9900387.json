The co-organizers are Professor V. Ramamurthy of Tulane University and Professor K. Takagi of Nagoya University in Japan.  The meeting will focus on recent results in the area of photoreactions in organized assemblies, photochemistry and photophysics in nanostructures and photochemistry related to materials science and biological science.  Discussion will revolve around the following topics:  1) photochemical and photophysical phenomena in organic-inorganic hybrid systems (materials science related problems);  2) the role of organized media in photoproduct selectivity (chemistry in supramolecular assembly); and 3) supramolecular chemistry as related to biological phenomena.\r\n\r\nPhotochemistry is at a crossroad and the exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger scientists.  The proceedings of the meeting are expected to be made available by the organizers on a web-site at Tulane University.  A brief scientific report of the meeting will also be published in the newsletter of Inter-American Photochemical Society.\r\n***\r\n",
