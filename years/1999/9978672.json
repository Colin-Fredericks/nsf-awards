 "awd_abstract_narration": "***\r\n9978672\r\nLytton\r\nThis project is to determine how empirical strength and plastic deformation\r\nproperties of unsaturated soils are related to more fundamental physical,\r\nchemical, and thermodynamic properties of the soil particles, water, and salts\r\ndissolved in the water.   The more fundamental properties referred to are the\r\nHelmholtz surface energies, wetting and dewetting angles, solute\r\nconcentrations, particle size gradations of the soil particles, and the\r\nvolumetric concentrations of soil, water, and air.  These are expected to\r\nunderlie the fracture and healing properties of the unsaturated soil and\r\nexplain the logarithmic work hardening, yield, and plastic potential\r\ncharacteristics of the soil under repeated loading.  To the knowledge of the\r\nresearch team, there has been little done in the past to make use of the\r\nconnection, which has been recently established in polymers, between the\r\nviscoelastic characteristics of a soil, the Helmholtz surface energies, and the\r\nrate of change of dissipated \"pseudo-strain\" energy in the fracture of that\r\nsoil.  In addition, it has recently been discovered that under repeated\r\nloading, the rate of change of dissipated pseudo-strain energy explains the\r\nplastic work hardening of a composite material like an unsaturated soil.  It is\r\nthe purpose of this proposed project to explore these connections in\r\nfine-grained unsaturated soil to see if the same connections can be made.  It\r\nis also proposed here to determine the effect of the osmotic water potential on\r\nthe fracture and plasticity properties of a soil.  The osmotic potential is\r\nrelated to the concentration of organic or inorganic salts dissolved in the\r\npore water.  A major effect of the concentration of solute in pore water is to\r\nalter the wetting or dewetting angle.  It is known that some salts will\r\nincrease and other salts will decrease the wetting angle and thus will have a\r\ndistinctive effect upon the strength of the soil.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the measurement of these properties possible is the recent\r\nacquisition at Texas A&M of a German-built Universal sorption apparatus and the\r\nrecent construction of a triaxial unsaturated soil stress path cell with\r\nunusually broad capabilities.  The first equipment makes it possible to measure\r\nall of the components of the Helmholtz surface energies: the Lifshitzvan der\r\nWaals apolar components and the Lewis acid and base polar components.  The\r\nsecond item of equipment makes it possible to make carefully controlled tests\r\non unsaturated soils while measuring all components of mechanical stress and\r\nstrain and all components of the water potential over larger ranges than have\r\nbeen achieved with similar equipment in the past.  The final unique capability\r\nthat fits these two test apparati together is the ability recently developed at\r\nTexas A&M to analyze the test data to determine the dissipated pseudo-strain\r\nenergy with each load cycle.\r\n***",
