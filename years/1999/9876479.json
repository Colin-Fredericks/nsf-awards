 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project  addresses the synthesis of InxGa1-xN quantum dots(QDs) via a three step electrochemical process.  Indium and gallium are co-deposited from aqueous solutions to form nanoparticles of InxGa1-x having a known, average composition followed by electrochemical oxidation of InxGa1-x nanoparticles to form (InxGa1-x)203.  The third step involves displacement of the oxide from (InxGa1-x)203 with nitride derived from a reactive source such as ammonia, hydrazine, or hydrazoic acid to form InxGa1-xN QDs and byproducts (gaseous water and hydrogen).  Steps 1 and 2 occur at room temperature, and conditions for step 3 will be sought permitting the displacement process to occur efficiently at temperatures below 400C.  The approach includes synthesis, as outlined above, and structural characterization and optical characterization of InxGa1-xN QDs.  Synthesis parameters will be studied to achieve greater understanding of the processes involved, and to control the particle size mono-dispersity.  Optical spectroscopy will be used to guide the synthesis of InxGa1-xN QDs which are luminescent at the bandedge.  The PL and absorption properties of these QDs will then be correlated with the indium mole fraction determined using neutron activation analysis.  \r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new aspects of electronic/photonic devices.  The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the perform-ance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  A variety of fundamental issues are to be addressed in these investigations, and the proposed experiments will also develop a technologically important emissive material which is capable of spanning a large part of the visible spectrum.  An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.  \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
