 "awd_abstract_narration": "9904036\r\nTice\r\n\r\nResearch universities have done an exemplary job in preparing graduate students to conduct research.  However, in order to minimize the stress and difficulties of new faculty members and to improve the quality of instruction, attention must be given at the pre-doctoral level to the other aspects of faculty life, in particular teaching.  The Engineering Education Scholars Programs hosted by such institutions as the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Carnegie Mellon University are beginning to address these concerns.  We are proposing to host an additional workshop at Syracuse University's Adirondack Conference Center for three consecutive summers from 1999 to 2001.  These workshops will broaden the preparation of advanced graduate students and junior faculty for academic positions by offering sessions related to the professional development of the participants with a particular emphasis on teaching responsibilities.  The goals of the workshops are to work with participants to provide them with strategies and tools to: 1) improve their teaching; 2) document and provide evidence of effectiveness in their scholarly life; 3) promote reflection about their practice and begin a plan for on-going professional development; and 4) enhance their ability to communicate to diverse audiences.\r\n\r\nBy the end of each of the workshops participants will have created a professional portfolio, which will include a reflective statement about teaching, a professional development plan, a videotape, including two presentations that utilize different pedagogical strategies, and syllabi.  Participants will also have established a network of colleagues to whom they can turn for support and collaboration, and be equipped to continue developing their professional portfolios and create a CD version which will be submitted in the February to the workshop faculty.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the summer workshops, we art also proposing to establish a Connection among the National Science Foundation's Engineering Education Scholars Programs.  During fall meetings the co-directors of all NSF-funded workshops will share materials, strategies, and evaluation results.  This also provides the co-directors the opportunity for collaboration regarding longitudinal assessment.\r\n",
