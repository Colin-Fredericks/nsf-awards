The system will be constructed using a base system purchased with DOD/ONR funds, which provide the high resolution goniometer and x-ray generator.  The Major Research Instrumentation funds will provide an improved sample holder and superior incident beam, diffracted beam and detector optical components.  These components will transform the base system into a high resolution x-ray diffractometer with microfocus capability.  The HRMX facility will produce synchrotron quality x-rays, which will solve a variety of problems associated with epitaxial single crystals, single crystals, textured polycrystalline materials, thin films and particulate mixtures.  The facility will serve both the academic and industrial community by being available on a fee for service basis.  The machine will have an impact on a large number of research groups and local industry, who otherwise would not have access to a high resolution X-ray diffractometer.  Training programs will be established via a collaboration with the instrument manufacturer (Philips Electronic Instruments Co.), who will jointly establish a summer school intended to train scientists and students interested in high resolution X-ray diffraction methods.  Since Philips has chosen Rutgers as a user-group, the HRMX facility will maintain its technological edge by providing feedback for Philips on new products that may be of use to the materials community. \r\n\r\nSupport from the Major Research Instrumentation program will be used to help build a high resolution microfocus X-ray diffraction facility that will be used to solve a variety of problems associated with advanced materials. The machine will have an impact on a large number of research groups and local industry, as well on the students that will be trained in its use.\r\n",
