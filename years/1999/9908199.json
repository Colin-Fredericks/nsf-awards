 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop an advanced measuring system that is capable of high-precision/high-speed measurement of six-degree-of-freedom motion.  This measuring system is characterized by an integrated use of high-resolution interferometric system, advanced computational algorithms, real-time computational software, and the associated electronics.  In order to accomplish the goal of the project, three research objectives and one development objective are identified:  (1) design and implementation of interferometric systems,  (2) analysis and calibration of metrology alignment, (3) development of real-time computational algorithms for information integration, and  (4) implementation of real-time electronics and system integration.  The measuring system will be integrated with a magnetic suspension actuator to facilitate the necessary feedback control of the actuator and to illustrate the desired characteristics of the measuring system in terms of precision and speed.  \r\n\r\nThis project is expected to impact on the general areas of sensor technology, coordinate metrology, precision motion control, and nano-fabrications.  The developed measuring system can be integrated with other equipment to form new measuring tools and high precision machinery.\r\n\r\n",
