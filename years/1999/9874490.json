 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a unique chloride channel found in epithelial cells throughout the body.  While functionally an ion channel, structurally CFTR belongs to a family of ATPase-dependent transporters known as ABC transporters.  CFTR, however, is the only known member to function primarily as an ion channel.  Because of its unique molecular evolution, the CFTR channel is an interesting and important model for biophysical studies of ion channel structure and function.  The experiments that comprise this project are based on preliminary studies which show that the gating of the channel is altered by the reduction/oxidation (redox) state of the protein.  The experiments use a combination of molecular biological and electrophysiological techniques to examine the role of redox-sensitive cysteine residues in modulating channel gating.  The results will be used to identify domain interactions within the protein that are important for channel function.  The major hypotheses to be tested are (1) that gating of the channel is influenced by the redox state of specific cysteine residues which if mutated change channel properties, (2) that reintroducing cysteines into strategic areas of mutated proteins will restore normal activity and will help identify regions of the protein important for channel function, and (3) that nitric oxide, when produced by cells, acts as an endogenous redox regulator of the CFTR channel.  The research will involve the direct participation of undergraduates, and thus will enhance both the research and educational environment of the Biology Department at Morehouse College\r\n\r\n",
