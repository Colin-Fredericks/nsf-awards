 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site in Psychology at Saint Louis University.  The program is intended to benefit selected African-American undergraduate students in five participating institutions by providing them with experiences that will increase the likelihood that they will apply to graduate programs in psychology.  Four Atlanta University Center institutions (Clark-Atlanta University, Morehouse, Morris Brown, and Spelman) have agreed to collaborate with Saint Louise University to achieve the objectives of the program.  The program involves identification of students in the sophomore year, preparation of research plans during the junior year, and intensive research experience during the following summer, and completion of program activities in the senior year.  Research will be supervised electronically and through faculty exchanges.  In addition to involvement in research during the summer, students also will take an ethics course, present their research at a local conference, and participate in two workshops, one on the GRE and the other on careers in psychological science.  In the senior year, projects will be submitted for presentation and publication, and students will be assisted with their graduate school applications.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n\r\n",
