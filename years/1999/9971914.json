The first set of\r\nproblems is focused on developing a better understanding of\r\nsymplectic manifolds, and in particular on the topology and\r\ngeometry of symplectic manifolds equipped with group actions.\r\nThe past five years have seen a significant increase of the role\r\nof the symplectic category in topology and geometry, as well as a\r\nbetter understanding of the analogies and differences between\r\nsymplectic geometry and Kahler geometry.  In this proposal we\r\npropose to develop tools for the study of Hamiltonian and\r\nsymplectic group actions, as well as of the topology and geometry\r\nof symplectic quotients.  The second set of problems we are\r\nconcerned with is the application of ideas from symplectic\r\ngeometry to problems arising in other areas of mathematics and\r\nmathematical physics.  These problems are largely motivated by\r\nthe applications of quantum field theory to geometry and\r\ntopology, many of which either involve symplectic geometry\r\ndirectly or else involve areas where symplectic geometry can help\r\nto provide a better view of the geometrical structure that must\r\nunderlie these still-mysterious methods arising from physics.\r\n\r\nThe areas of mathematics involved---symplectic geometry and\r\nmathematical physics---are areas which have their historical\r\norigins in the physical sciences.  As such, they have had a long\r\nrecord of gaining insight from problems arising in the natural\r\nsciences, as well as of making significant contributions to\r\napplied problems.  This record is one attained mostly by the\r\nwhole field over decades, rather than by individual contributions\r\nover the short term.  But to the extent that a long and consistent\r\npast record can be used as an indication of the future, there are\r\nexcellent prospects that current work in these areas of core\r\nmathematics will provide indispensible building blocks for\r\nscientific and technological advances in the decades to come.\r\n",
