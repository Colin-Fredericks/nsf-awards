This process produces composite films consisting of a metallic matrix containing a dispersion of small particles.  Electrocodeposited films with micron size particles have found important applications in areas such as corrosion and wear protection, lubrication, and electrocatalysis.  Although composite films are currently manufactured using this technique, the ability to define the conditions necessary to achieve a specified volume fraction of uniformly dispersed particles in the deposited film has not been established.  An understanding of how the deposition rate depends on the processing conditions is essential to controlling the deposit composition and properties.  The objective of the research is to improve the ability to tailor electrodeposited metal matrix composite films of both uniform and gradient particle distributions by investigating the effects of process variables on particle incorporation within the deposit.  The electrocodeposition of alumina particles in a copper matrix will be systematically studied using a rotating cylinder electrode.  This electrode configuration allows the effects of hydrodynamics on particle incorporation to be investigated.  New materials structures of gradient composite films with a gradient in the particle concentration will be made based upon the results of the electrocodeposition study.  Existing models of codeposition will be applied to the experimental data, and an improved model or correlation of electrocodeposition will be developed.\r\n\r\n",
