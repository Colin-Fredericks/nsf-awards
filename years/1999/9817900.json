 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches are being used in Arabidopsis to study the function of distinct subcellular isoenzymes of aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT). Aspartate synthesis by AspAT is crucial to plant growth and development, as aspartate serves to transport assimilated nitrogen to seeds, and is the precursor to essential amino acids including methionine and lysine. Thus, understanding which subcellular AspAT isoenzymes control aspartate synthesis may have applications for modifiying the synthesis of essential aspartate-derived amino acids in crop plants less amenable to molecular-genetic analysis. Arabidopsis contains five ASP genes encoding AspAT isoenzymes localized to the cytosol, chloroplasts, mitochondria or peroxisomes. Arabidopsis mutants defective in the major AAT isoenzymes: cytosolic AAT2 (aat2) or chloroplastic AAT3 (aat3) have been isolated and are being used to determine the function of each subcellular isoenzyme in vivo. Analysis of aat2 mutants has shown that cytosolic AAT2 controls the bulk of N-assimilation into aspartate in the light and that this pool of aspartate in the cytosol is converted into asparagine for N-transport in the dark. A parallel analysis of mutants defective in chloroplastic aat3 shows that AAT3 controls the synthesis of aspartate in chloroplasts, and that this pool of aspartate in chloroplasts is used for methionine biosynthesis, an essential aspartate-derived amino acid. Thus, this research on the aat2 and aat3 mutants of Arabidopsis has provided insight into metabolic flux from subcellular pools of aspartate in vivo which could not have been predicted based on in vitro biochemical studies of the isolated isoenzymes. Additional studies include the isolation of mutants defective in mitochondrial or peroxisomal isoenzymes of AspAT. These additional studies should address roles of these other subcellular AAT isoenzymes in aspects of aspartate metabolism including plant-specific processes such as photorespiration. Most importantly, an unexpected finding is that certain mutations in the ASP genes of the aat2 and aat3 mutations lead to aspartate overaccumulation. These mutations in the corresponding ASP genes appear to impair aspartate degradation, but not aspartate synthesis by the mutant enzyme. These mutant ASP genes will be expressed in transgenic plants in an attempt to engineer plants that overproduce aspartate. Such transgenic plants may be expected to exhibit increased rates of nitrogen assimilation and/or produce seeds with higher levels of aspartate-derived essential amino acids.. Thus, these studies on aspartate synthesis and catabolism in a model genetic plant, may have significant impact on improving nitrogen assimilation and/or the synthesis of essential aspartate-derived amino acids in crop plants.",
