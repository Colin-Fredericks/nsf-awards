D'Angelo\r\n\r\nAbstract: D'Angelo's project will continue his investigation of a complex variables version of Hilbert's seventeenth problem (due to Catlin and D'Angelo) and give applications of it to complex geometry, analysis, and algebra. He proposes to derive corollaries of the Catlin-D'Angelo isometric imbedding theorem for holomorphic bundles, and to extend the result to certain degenerate metrics. This work bears directly on the problem of classifying proper holomorphic mappings between balls in different dimensions. The complex variables version of Hilbert's seventeenth problem already proved has the following consequence. Suppose one is given a polynomial on complex Euclidean space that does not vanish on the closed unit ball. This polynomial must then be the denominator of a rational proper mapping (reduced to lowest terms) between balls, but the target dimension needs to be chosen sufficiently large. Thus restricting the target dimension constrains the complexity of a proper map between balls. Work of Faran gives further evidence of this. D'Angelo seeks to prove a general theorem providing a sharp bound for the degree of a proper rational mapping between unit balls in different dimensions. This will provide evidence for a more general conjecture about CR mappings between CR manifolds of different dimensions.\r\n\r\nIn his famous address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, David Hilbert posed a series of research problems that have greatly influenced the development of mathematics in this century. Artin solved Hilbert's original Seventeenth Problem around 1925 by proving that a polynomial in several real variables whose values are nonnegative must be a sum of squares of rational functions. The natural analogue of this result for polynomials of several complex variables does not hold. Given the importance of complex variable theory in physics, engineering, and pure mathematics, it is natural to consider other facsimiles of Hilbert's problem for complex polynomials. In recent years, D'Angelo discovered that such analogues play a crucial role in the study of objects known as \"proper mappings\" between balls in different complex dimensions. D'Angelo and Catlin later established a version of Artin's theorem in the complex setting. Its application to proper mappings enables one to understand the role of the unit sphere in higher dimensions and thus furnishes a multidimensional tool for the study of electrostatics, diffusion, and fluid flow. More recently, Catlin and D'Angelo have proved a major result that generalizes their earlier theorems by casting them in an abstract framework, the framework of so-called holomorphic vector bundles. The proof gives an unexpected application of the Bergman kernel function (a part of analysis) to a problem in algebra, as well as a geometric reinterpretation of Hilbert's problem. The result may have considerable significance for the parts of modern mathematical physics (such as string theory and supersymmetry) where holomorphic vector bundles play a large role. D'Angelo is the 1999 winner of the Bergman Prize, and this work is mentioned in the citation. D'Angelo's current proposal suggests various extensions of and applications for these ideas.\r\n",
