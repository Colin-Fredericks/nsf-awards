 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the failure of many African nations to achieve wide-spread land-reform programs to redress colonial land-distribution patterns, substantial land-redistribution has taken place through numerous individual transactions.  This process has been especially pronounced in South Africa, where land redistribution is taking place largely outside the auspices of the state.  Although some studies have been conducted of different facets of the land-redistribution process, very little attention has focused on the impacts of redistribution on rural livelihoods, especially food security and land uses.  This doctoral dissertation research project will focus on land-use change and its impact on livelihoods in South Africa, examining areas where previously dispossessed people have moved onto, rural people formerly dispossessed are moving onto \"white\" farms as well as areas from which resettlers have come.  One key emphases of this study is determination of whether people in both newly resettled and source areas have more or less livelihood security than in their previous situation.  Another emphasis is on assessment of land-use intensification, extensification, or abandonment occurring in the areas \"left behind\" and whether these changes help or hinder household livelihoods.  This study will draw upon archival sources in South Africa and in the U.S. to assess land uses in the Northern Province throughout recent history.  A pilot study and initial key informant interviews will give direction to the study and lay the groundwork for the more structured interview schedule, which will be conducted in rural areas near Sovenga (Mankweng) in the Northern Province.  A questionnaire-based survey will provide most of the data for the study, with follow-up interviews and group discussions assisting in analysis and verification of findings.  This project will provide new insights into the impact of resettlement on the food security and other facets of the livelihood of resettlers and those who remain in the areas where they previously lived.  The research results also will shed new light on the relative contributions of agriculture, non-farm activities, and remittances/pensions have on rural livelihoods and the efficacy of land redistribution on the lives of rural people.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n",
