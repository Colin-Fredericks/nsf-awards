 "awd_abstract_narration": "Texture and Transverse profile measurements of highway surfaces are critical for highway safety.  It is the texture which provides skid resistance and the transverse profile that dictates surface drainage.  Currently, highway agencies can not measure these properties in real time.  High accurancy lasers are under investigation but these are fragile and cost prohibitive for full-scale implementation.  The proposed research will focus on the research and development of a new fast, accurate, and low-cost technique for measuring pavement surface characteristics in real time, including transverse profiles, micro and macro textures, and detecting areas of mix segregation in newly constructed asphalt surfaces.  This new technology will have a major impact on both safety and new construction quality control.  The new technique will be based on the principles of heterodyne, reflectmetry, and interferometry implemented using millimeter waves in the very high frequency range of 90 to 100 GHz.  Reflectometry is used in microwaves and optics for reflection measurement.  Heterodyne interferometry is used in optics as one of the best methods for accurate measurment of surface roughness of electronic materials.  Compared to other technologies, millimeter waves have two uniquely distinct characteristics, which can be explained for accurate non-destructive, non-contact high-resolution surface measurements:  higher frequencies and larger absolute bandwidths.  These characteristics together can produce systems that have very fine resolution and small size.  The proposed technique appears to be the best candidate that can meet all the key specifications required for the pavement problems addressed in this project, namely fast and accurate measurement, very fine resolution, low cost, and small size.  There are four major objectives in this research.  The first objective is to research and develop a new millimeter-wave profilometer in the frequency range of 90 to 100 GHz.  The second objective is to analyze surface reflections and interference patterns.  This is needed for accurate data acquisition and processing of the measured results.  The third objective is to fabricate various laboratory test specimens needed for the evaluation of the new sensor.  The fourth objective is to evaluate the new sensor in both laboratory and field tests.  The proposed new technique has not yet been studied and developed for civil engineering applications.  It thus not only will provide a unique solution for the pavement surface problems addressed here, but also should open up a whole range of new applications, which have not been feasible with available techniques and systems.  Successful research and development of this novel technique for pavement applications will demonstrate feasibility of using millimeter waves in the 90 to 100 GHz range for high-resolution pavement surface measurements, and pave the way for future research and developments of advanced low-cost millimeter-wave sensors for civil engineering applications.  The research proposed should therefore have a strong impact on a number of current and future applications of civil engineering.",
