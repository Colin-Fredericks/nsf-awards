 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global environmental change confronts humankind in many important\r\nways.  Tropical deforestation is one of the most pressing problems because\r\nof its significant roles as a source and sink of greenhouse gases, a\r\ndepository of biotic diversity, a determinant of local climate, and as the\r\nresource base for a rapidly growing population worldwide.  Much of the work\r\non tropical deforestation to date has focused on science independent of\r\npolicy relevance.  The proposed research seeks to redress this situation.\r\nIt develops an explicitly policy-oriented model to project trends and\r\nscenarios of tropical deforestation for one of the remaining large blocks of\r\ntropical forests in southern Mexico.  As this area is subject to growing\r\nimmigration and resource extraction, resource managers and institutions are \r\nfaced with a bewildering array of immediate and longer term decisions.  \r\nThe model therefore considers deforestation as the result of peasant farmer\r\ndecision making in the context of an array of complex biophysical and\r\nsocioeconomic environments.  A new type of simulation model will be\r\ndeveloped, one that captures the \"reality\" of the situation but yet provides\r\noutputs that are policy relevant.  The model does so by: (1) examining how\r\nindividual decision making is affected by environmental and socioeconomic\r\nconstraints; (2) incorporating explicit spatial and temporal patterns of\r\nforest change; (3) assessing the role of the value of information and\r\nuncertainty; and (4) permitting stakeholders and policy makers to evaluate\r\nscenarios of alternative land-use and institutional strategies.  The model\r\nis not conceptually derived but based on household surveys, archival\r\nresearch, and spatial data including aerial photography, satellite imagery,\r\nand maps of land-use and biophysical characteristics.\r\n",
