 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861209\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to conduct research on turbo recording methods for both magnetic and optical storage systems and implement these methods in a Turbo Recording Chip. This chip provides the potential for substantial increases in recording density and data transfer rates for a wide range of magnetic and optical recording technologies. Recording is often modeled as a noisy channel with memory. The \"analog\" character of the noise of the recording channel implies that soft decision decoding can provide significant benefits. Turbo coding, a relatively new and exciting coding technique involves a powerful code construction with an iterative, soft decision decoding. This project considers the issues involved in the construction of a turbo-coding chip for recording that will provide the means for encoding and decoding that effectively utilize the memory of the channel near its theoretical potential.\r\n     This technology would be particularly suited for the magnetic tape industry where the market for magnetic recording equipment is estimated at over 10 billion per year and the need for magnetic tape density is accelerating.\r\n\r\n",
