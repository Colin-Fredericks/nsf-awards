 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis research examines the partisan choices of Indonesian voters in the June, 1999 parliamentary election, which is the first democratic election in Indonesia in 44 years.  A national probability sample of 2,500 randomly chosen respondents is interviewed directly about their choice of party and the factors affecting that choice.  These factors include:  (1) religious beliefs and affiliations, (2) ethnic and regional loyalties, (3) social class and economic interest position and perception, (4) attachment to national party leaders, (5) attentiveness of local opinion leaders, and (6) retrospective evaluation of party performance in power.\r\n\r\n\tIn broad theoretical terms, the first three factors are in the tradition of the sociological analysis of voting behavior, whereas the second three are more psychological in that they focus on more narrow or face-to-face ties and personal evaluations, either of leaders or issues.  Although sociological factors, especially religion, clearly play a prominent role in Indonesian politics, psychological factors have not be given their due, in part because no systematic surveys have been conducted that would enable analysts to get beneath the surface appearance of group voting to the deeper level of individual choice.  Individuals' assessments of national party leaders, their exposure to local opinion leaders, and their judgments of the performance of the party in power are hypothesized to have an impact on party choice to some degree independent of, and sometimes in conflict with, sociological factors.\r\n\r\nThe study also is set in the context of elections in newly democratizing countries.  Two issues are paramount here.  First, what is the legacy of decades of authoritarianism on political and social life:  a permanently flattened organizational landscape or temporarily frozen organizations, built on deep social and cultural cleavages that now are returning to life?  Second, what are the consequences for democracy of party systems that narrowly reflect social and cultural divisions versus those that reach across or bridge them?  This question is addressed by assessing the extent to which the evolving Indonesian party system, in the minds of our respondents, is reflective  or bridging, and by linking that assessment to the behavior of party leaders. \r\n",
