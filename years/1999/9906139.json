The objective of the workshop is to examine what can be learned from recent science and technology policy evaluation approaches and to consider implications for future evaluation strategies and framework policies.  The workshop will approach this problem through benchmarking the state of the art and exploring ideas, opportunities, projects, and needs for future work.\r\n\r\nThe US investigator brings to this workshop expertise in changes in US science and technology policy evaluation.  This is complemented by EU expertise and interest in collaborating internationally after a period of intensive internal building of European-level science and technology policy projects and evaluation networks.  The goal of the workshop is to initiate a multi-year US-European network that would aim to share best practices and review methods, examine policy implications of evaluation, and stimulate new collaborative research projects.\r\n",
