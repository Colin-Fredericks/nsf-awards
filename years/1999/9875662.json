Khokhar\r\n\r\nThis project deals with the design and development of parallel\r\nalgorithms, computation model, and runtime support tools for efficient\r\nexecution of multimedia applications on multithreaded computing\r\nplatforms. In particular, applications that employ irregular\r\ncomputation structures and data dependent communication patterns are\r\nstudied and used as a vehicle to investigate algorithmic and\r\nimplementation issues related to multithreaded computing.  While\r\nexisting computation models lack in capturing the architectural and\r\ncomputation characteristics of the multithreaded paradigms, a new\r\nmodel is investigated to be used as a platform for algorithms'\r\ndevelopment. Load adaptive parallel algorithms and implementations are\r\ndeveloped by taking advantage of the computation and communication\r\noverlapping characteristics of the multithreaded computing\r\nparadigm. The executions of the programs based on the proposed\r\nalgorithms are supported by dynamic schedulers and load balancers\r\ndesigned as runtime support tools.  The application area focussed in \r\nthis  project consists of multimedia signal/image processing\r\napplications, particularly those based on non-linear signal processing\r\ntechniques. This project has a wide-spread impact on real-time\r\nmultimedia processing tasks in defense, scientific and commercial\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
