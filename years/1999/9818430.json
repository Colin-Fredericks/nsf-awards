 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous studies involving response choice tasks or various schedules of reinforcement have demonstrated that the effects of nucleus accumbens dopamine (DA) depletion interact strongly with the work requirements of the task.  Rats with accumbens DA depletion are impaired on behavioral tasks characterized by high levels of work output, and on choice procedures. Accumbens DA depletion causes animals to shift their relative response allocation in the direction of the task with lower work requirements.  On lever pressing tasks, rats with accumbens DA depletion appear to have deficits in maintaining the high work output necessary for emitting large numbers of responses. Although it is difficult to identify precisely the behavioral functions that are affected by accumbens DA depletion, the current working hypothesis for this research is that accumbens DA depletion reduces the propensity for expending energy or effort. A series of experiments is proposed to determine if rats with accumbens DA depletion have problems responding to delayed or intermittent reinforcement, or if their central problem is responding to large work requirements, including force requirements.  It is hypothesized that rats with accumbens DA depletion do not have \"anhedonia\" (i.e., a lack of emotional response to food); indeed, rats with accumbens DA depletion remain directed towards the acquisition and consumption of food provided that the work requirement is relatively low. Instead, it is thought that rats with accumbens DA depletion have \"anergia\" (i.e., less likely to work for food).  This function can be conceived of as a higher-order sensorimotor process, which is very similar to the concept of \"activational\" aspects of motivation. This research could identify mechanisms in the brain that  regulate energy expenditure, and modulate how effort is allocated into various response alternatives. \r\n",
