 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a current move  towards collaboratively constructing knowledge using multidisciplinary teams supported by an electronic communications infrastructure.  The exponential growth of knowledge has made it virtually impossible for any organization to exist in isolation.  The networked organization, or alliance, is an increasingly common structural form within and between science, government, business, and non-profit organizations.  An alliance is a collection of organizations that have entered into collaborative relationships usually involving multiple channels of communication and knowledge diffusion across disciplinary boundaries. The proliferation of alliances has been stimulated, in part, by emerging electronic technologies to support collaboration, ranging from email and intranets to desktop videoconferencing and collaborative data mining and visualization.  Across business and government organizations, tremendous resources and significant financial investment have been devoted toward these efforts.  The NSF funded national initiative to prototype the advanced computational infrastructure for the 21st century is based on an alliance model.\r\n\r\nAlliance organizations depend on effective virtual collaboration.  However, emprical research exploring collaborative knowledge processes and the function of elecronic infrastructures in distributed work groups reveals an important contradiction.  This contradiciton emerges, on the one hand, from observations that authentic knowledge processes are somehow embedded within specific practices and interpersonal exchanges.  On the other hand, successful use of electronic infrastructures to support knowledge processes among distributed teams depends on knowledge being made mobile, that is, transferable across people located in different places.  Thus, it may be very difficult to transfer authentic embedded knowledge beyond the specific setting and set of people in which the context for that knowledge is consensually understood.  This contradiciton will be investigated in this research: the nature of knowledge processes in groups and the goals of electronic infrastructures to support distributed knowledge processes may be in direct conflict with one another.  \r\n\r\nThis project examines the construction and sharing of knowledge among multidisciplinary scientific teams in the National Computational Science Alliance (Alliance).  The Alliance is one of two NSF-funded partnerships out of the PACI program in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, consisting of over sixty educational, government, and industry partner organizations with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as the leading edge site.  Research investigators from social science, computer science, history, business, psychology, philosophy, and information science will explore the knowledge processes that are involved in virtual collaborative work.  The project is a multidisciplinary, multi-level and multi-method study into how electronic technologies are used to support knowledge production and sharing in this alliance and how such technologies can be used in other alliances as well.  The multidisciplinary research team itself reflects the research subject, and will derive the benefit of observing its own multidisciplinary distributed knowledge processes.  An additional outcome of the project's multidisciplinary approach, along with online dissemination efforts, will be a prototype social science workbench for studying knowledge processes in groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
