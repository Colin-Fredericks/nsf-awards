Coverings of curves in both characteristic zero and positive characteristic will be studied by translating various properties of the cover into properties of the corresponding arithmetic and geometric monodromy groups.  Automorphism groups of curves in positive characteristic will be investigated using sophisticated group theory -- especially the theory of primitive permutation groups and properties of finite simple groups.  The investigator intends to reduce many of the questions to the case of almost simple groups and investigate the almost simple groups.  Recent examples suggest that in positive characteristic, a special role will be played by Chevalley groups in that characteristic.   In joint work with Shareshian, symmetric and alternating groups acting on curves in all characteristics will be studied. This has already led to very detailed information about coverings by generic curves of a given genus -- a problem first studied by Zariski.  The analog of the Guralnick-Thompson conjecture  regarding composition factors of covers of by genus g curves in characteristic zero will be investigated.  Detailed probabilistic and asymptotic properties of finite groups will be investigated using detailed information about the subgroup structure of almost simple groups. Algebraic groups will also be investigated from this point of view.  Results on algebraic groups often shed light on the finite case, and one can often use results in one setting to obtain similar results in the other setting.\r\n\r\nThe activities supported in this proposal should  shed some new light on automorphism groups of curves in positive characteristic as well as curves with special properties (e.g., curves with few points or many points or the median value number of points).  The investigator hopes to move closer to the complete classification of exceptional polynomials over finite fields (essentially bijective polynomials) which will have consequences in coding theory and cryptography.  The probabilistic group theory aspects of the proposal should lead to improvements in computational methods in group theory.  In particular, these methods should allow for probabilistic means of determining when random elements from a  finite group generate a proper subgroup as well as identifying  the group generated by a collection of elements.  Another goal of the project is to classify coverings of generic genus g curves in characteristic 0 and to find the correct analog in positive characteristic.  The techniques needed for this should prove useful in many sorts of covering curve problems.\r\n",
