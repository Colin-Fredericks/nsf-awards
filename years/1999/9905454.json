 "awd_abstract_narration": "9905454\r\n\r\nThe investigators develop a Monte-Carlo based approach to account for major sources of uncertainty that affect the extrapolation (\"scaling up\") of laboratory results to the field.  These include the uncertainty attached to the parameters of laboratory-based predictive models, and the uncertainty about the spatial distribution of environmental factors that are inputs to these numerical models.  The methodology is applied to the simulation and mapping of dioxin degradation (dechlorination) in general, and 2,3,7,8-TCDD fluxes in particular, in estuarine sediments.  The project involves the development of models relating the dioxin dechlorination rate to various input variables (salinity and respiratory conditions, dioxin concentrations, methane production, sulfate reduction), the geostatistical modeling of uncertainty about the spatial distribution of input variables through multivariate nonparametric stochastic simulation, and the analysis of uncertainty propagation through Latin hypercube sampling of the probability distributions of model parameters and input variables.  These risk assessments are accounted for in decision-making processes, such as identification of locations of largest uncertainty where additional samples should be collected, and in the long-term prediction of temporal trends in dioxin concentrations.\r\n\r\nDioxin-contaminated sediments pose serious threats for the environment and can entail costly clean-up to maintain the nation's waterways.  To avoid unnecessarily stringent remediation efforts, it is critical to map these contaminated sediments and to predict the current concentrations and how they could evolve in the near future.  Much research has been devoted so far to laboratory experimentation, which allowed a better understanding of the mechanisms governing the degradation of these contaminants under relevant ambient conditions as a function of sediment biogeochemistry.  Extrapolation of these results to the field is not straightforward because of the spatial variability of the contaminant concentrations and of the environmental factors (e.g. salinity, respiratory conditions) controlling their degradation.  This research develops a methodology to simulate the spatial distribution of dioxin concentrations and their degradation in time.  Multiple equally-likely scenarios are generated to assess the uncertainty arising from our imperfect knowledge of degradation mechanisms and of the spatial distribution of contaminants, in particular when sampling is sparse.  The approach is illustrated for the Lower Passaic River/Newark Bay estuary because there is an extensive temporal and spatial data base for this estuary.  Success of this research will help scientists and engineers to meet the increasing challenge to combine various sources of information acquired at field and laboratory scales with different levels of uncertainty (measurement and prediction errors).  It may prove useful in determining long-term risks posed by dioxin-contaminated sediments, and aid in the development of risk-based sediment management strategies.\r\n\r\n",
