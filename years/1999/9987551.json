The BICE  provides a unique structure to respond to specific requests from  government, or to act on its own initiative with public or private  sector support.  In pursuit of its goals, BICE plans to conduct on-going strategic planning and oversee committee activities involving  studies, workshop, symposia, and a variety of information  dissemination activities.",
