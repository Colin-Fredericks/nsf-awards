 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Mary Adair will obtain 40 AMS radiocarbon dates on food plants recovered from 11 archaeological sites within the central Plains of North America. Because only small amounts of carbon are necessary, the AMS technique permits dating of plant fragments themselves rather than adjacent charcoal which may, or may not be chronologically associated. The project is part of Dr. Adair's ongoing research into the development of agriculture in the region. The sites to be dated range in age from late Archaic (ca. 1500-700 BC) to plains villages (ca. AD 900-1400) are located within the eastern portion of the central Plains. The cultigens to be dated include curcubit (squash), common bean, marshelder, sunflower and maize. Direct dates will help establish a temporal and spatial pattern for the emergence of agriculture in an area of North America where extremely little data is available. Understanding the ways in which domesticated plants contributed to the diet and lifestyle of prehistoric central Plains populations must begin with an undisputed association of when, where and what crops were grown. A sequence of direct dates on cultigens from sites that span a spatial and temporal dimension will go far in helping to establish how and when agriculture developed. Such patterns become more obvious with a substantial number of direct dates on a variety of domesticates.\r\n\r\nArchaeologists who wish to understand the rise of complex societies know that domesticated plants and animals provide the subsistence base on which civilization arose. Ethnohistoric data indicate that at the time of European contact in North America, Middle American domesticates such as maize, squash and beans formed a central triad and were cultivated in most areas with appropriate soil and climatic conditions. However recent evidence has shown a complicated picture. First, these important plants were preceded by local domesticates such as marshelder and sunflower; this means that the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture resulted from local processes and not diffusion. Secondly, no neat one to one correlation exists between the development of agriculture and social complexity and groups can practice cultivation for centuries without significant changes in lifestyle. While much data is available for the Southeast and Southwestern portions of the US, relatively little is known about the central Plains and this area is of particular interest because it lies outside the hearths of primary domestication. The chronology provided by this award will establish a framework for understanding agriculture in this region.\r\n\r\n",
