Lake Agassiz was also instrumental in routing glacial meltwater from the retreating ice sheet to the Gulf of Mexico, North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.  However, the timing and location of the northwest outlet which fed water to the Arctic Ocean is not well understood.  Knowing the outlet chronology is especially critical because opening of the northwest outlet was nearly coincident with the sudden ending of the Younger Dryas cold period and with a pause in the warming known as the Preboreal oscillation.  The effects on atmospheric and oceanic circulation from meltwater discharged to either the Arctic Ocean or gulf of Mexico would have been significant, influencing North Atlantic thermohaline circulation.  \r\n",
