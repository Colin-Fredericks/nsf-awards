The purposes of this conference are threefold. First, to\r\nbring together the leading experts in geometry, and especially in\r\nthe fields closely related to physics. Second, to survey the\r\nrecent remarkable progress spurred by physics, especially string\r\ntheory, and point to new directions and frontiers for young\r\nresearchers, graduate students and postdocs. Third, to further\r\nstimulate the fruitful interactions between mathematics and\r\nphysics in coordination with the program \"Geometry and Duality\"\r\nto be run right after this conference at the Institute for\r\nTheoretical Physics, UCSB.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we are witnessing the blossoming of a golden age of\r\ninteractions between physics (in particular high energy physics)\r\nand mathematics (in particular, differential geometry,\r\ndifferential topology and algebraic geometry). On the one hand,\r\nphysicists, guided by physical intuitions and equipped with most\r\nadvanced mathematical tools, bring about new break-throughs which\r\npose new challenging problems and also provide new insights for\r\nmathematics. On the other hand, mathematicians, inspired and\r\nspurred by advances in physics, make amazing progresses in\r\nmathematics, which in turn provide new machineries for\r\nphysicists.  Mathematicians also make direct contributions to\r\nphysics in collaboration with physicists. The joint efforts of\r\nphysicists and mathematicians lead to major advances in our\r\nunderstanding of the structures of the universe, and will\r\nultimately uncover major new energy sources and provide new\r\nfoundations for more powerful natural computations at higher and\r\ndeeper levels.  The Santa Barbara Summer Conference in Geometry\r\nis designed to make contributions in the framework of these\r\ndevelopments.\r\n",
