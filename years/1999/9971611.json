There are two broad objectives.  The first is to measure the single-particle electronic structure of selected correlated electron materials while the second attempts to construct a relation between the novel ground state properties and the underlying electronic structure.  These general goals will be pursued specifically on (A) the elucidation of non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior in 1) novel low dimensional materials and 2) in certain uranium materials, as well as (B) the study of the interplay between single-ion and lattice correlations in 1) the same uranium materials and 2) in 4f electron hexaboride alloys which manifest mixed valence and Kondo behavior. Photoemission spectroscopy, inverse photoemission spectroscopy as well as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and resonant photoemission spectroscopy will be the primary experimental techniques used.  This research will engage graduate students as well as post doctoral research associates in one of the forefront areas of contemporary condensed matter physics .\r\n%%%\r\nThis research deals with some important aspects of the behavior of electrons in metals and metal compounds, the understanding of which is needed to make progress in the direction of improved technology.  Graduate students and postdoctoral research associates will participate in this research.  They will thereby receive excellent training in an important area of condensed matter physics and  thus will be prepared to enter the technological mainstream which will define the scientific and technological directions during the next few decades of the 21st Century.  \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
