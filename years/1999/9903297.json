 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis research investigates new signaling techniques for power and bandwidth efficient digital communications.  Our approaches rely on the use of Turbo coding and iterative decoding principles which were first introduced in 1993. Turbo codes are remarkable because they can operate very close to the channel capacity (a theoretical limit on the maximum data rate for reliablecommunication over a given channel).  In this research, we are investigating the use of Turbo coding in conjunction with bandwidth-efficient modulation schemes that are suitable for satellite and land mobile radio communications.  Such schemes make efficient use of the limited bandwidth resources, while at the same time allowing communication at very low power levels, thereby conserving the battery power in mobile and portable terminals.  We are also investigating the application of Turbo codes to channels that exhibit time dispersion, such as wire-line channels used for voice band telephony and wireless channels used for cellular radio communications.  We are devising new signaling schemes and receiver structures, and performance analysis tools when Turbo codes are used on these types of channels.\r\n\r\nMany practical systems like mobile satellite communications and land mobile communications employ non-linear amplifiers at the receiver and, therefore,  require a very small peak-to-average power ratio for the modulated signal.  Continuous phase modulation (CPM) is an attractive technique for such systems\r\nbecause of its constant envelope and compact power density spectrum.  We are investigating the use of Turbo codes in combination with trellis coded modulation (TCM) and CPM.   Our objective is to achieve large coding gains without bandwidth expansion and a constant envelope for the modulated signal,\r\nmaking our schemes ideal for use in power and bandwidth limited communication systems. Also many physical channels exhibit inter-symbol interference (ISI), including static (wire-line telephone) ISI channels, and fading (cellular and PCS) ISI channels. It is important to devise techniques to either combat\r\nthe effects of ISI through efficient equalizer structures, or, mitigate the effects of ISI through the use of techniques like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).  Recently, iterative equalization and decoding has been considered by some researchers and shown to provide large coding gains on static ISI channels.  We are considering the application of Turbo codes to fading ISI channels and developing analytical tools to evaluate the performance of Turbo coding on ISI channels.  Some specific problems that we are investigating include:\r\nNovel approaches to the design and performance analysis of Turbo TCM schemes with CPM for AWGN, flat Rayleigh fading and flat Rician fading channels.\r\nReceiver design for coherent and non-coherent reception of Turbo Trellis coded CPM.\r\nPerformance analysis of Turbo coded systems for ISI channels and receiver structures for joint equalization, decoding and channel estimation.\r\nPractical receiver structures for Turbo-coded OFDM systems with adaptive parameter estimation.\r\n\r\n",
