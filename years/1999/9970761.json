The optical light from the stellar component of the stripped matter provides a tracer of this mass and could, depending on the epoch at which it was stripped, provide a map of the dark matter in the cluster.  This project is to observe the diffuse, intergalactic light in several clusters of galaxies.  All of these clusters have mass estimates deduced from galaxy velocity dispersions using the virial theorem, from X-ray profiles using hydrostatic equilibrium, and from observations of gravitational lensing of background galaxies.  The measurement of diffuse light will provide an additional constraint on the distribution of mass in these clusters as well as confirmation of the stripping hypothesis.  In addition, the brightness of intracluster light strongly constrains the dwarf star content of the dark matter.  The question of the low mass star content of dark matter has arisen because of the discovery of microlensing by low mass objects in the halo of the Milky Way.   The previous observations of the core of the rich cluster Abell 2029 have revealed what could be a tidal stripping event near the cluster center.  If this interpretation is correct, there is an excellent opportunity to study one of the most important processes in the evolution of clusters and it will be studied in more detail with high angular resolution observations of the tidal nebula, as well as with spectroscopic observations of the primary embedded galaxy and the nearby galaxies.\r\n\r\nThe diffuse emission to be detected in the intergalactic regions of superclusters of galaxies is not the optical light from stars but rather the X-ray emission from hot, ionized gas.  It has been clear for some time that the preponderance of baryonic matter in the universe must be in the form of ionized gas.  If this gas in superclusters is at the virial temperature then it should emit bremsstrahlung X-rays.  Diffuse 10 keV energy emission from the plane of the local supercluster has been detected its nature will be investigated.  The interaction of this gas with the CMB is also expected to be the source of a Sunayev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.  The expected signal is just at the sensitivity limit of the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite's DMR radiometers, but should be detectable with the new MAP and PLANCK satellite observatories.  The feasibility of such observations will be investigated by modeling both Galactic contamination to the CMB radiation and the random fluctuations in the CMB.   There is also involvement in a project to detect X-ray emission from the nearby Shapley supercluster using the RXTE X-ray satellite and the prospects for detecting the SZ effect in that cluster will be investigated.\r\n",
