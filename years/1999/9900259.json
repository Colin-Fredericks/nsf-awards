 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem to be addressed in this research is how to assist designers in designing several related products from a common base.  This problem has two aspects: (1) how to design common platforms for a family of products, and (2) how to synthesize and reason about the variety that can be supported from the common platform.  A Product Family Reasoning System (PFRS) is proposed to provide the computational foundation for determining suitable common product family platforms and synthesizing individual products within a proposed family.  The proposed approach is to study the application of discrete mathematics to the configuration design of platforms and products within a product family.  Configuration design involves the identification of which components are in a design and which relationships should exist among these components.  Since discrete mathematics deals with the study of objects and their relationships, it is an appropriate foundation for studying configuration design, platform commonization, and product family design.  Additionally, the area of decision-based design will guide this research to ensure that design decisions are properly formulated and made.  Automobile platform design will be the primary application area for this project.\r\n     Expected results of this research include a new product family design approach that will consider product and process aspects, and computational methods for designing common platforms and products within a product family.  Potential new discoveries from this research include a discrete mathematical foundation for configuration design, algorithms for synthesizing product platforms and products, and design methods that enable trade-offs among product architecture choices to be evaluated.  The significance of these discoveries includes guidance to designers on rationalizing product family platforms.  Such guidance involves the appropriate consideration of product and assembly facility capabilities during design, and the opportunity to make appropriate decisions given preferences among possibly competing objectives.\r\n",
