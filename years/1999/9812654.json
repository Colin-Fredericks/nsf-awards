 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant portion of formal (mathematical) analyses in the social and behavioral sciences during the last half-century has been organized around the modelling of choices and defining an operational concept of rationality, both for individual decision makers and for collective decision makers (i.e., social institutions).  This training workshop, to be held at the University of California, Irvine in summer 2000, will provide a detailed introduction to such formal approaches in three substantive areas where the research effort has been intense and shows no sign of abatement, namely:  individual decision making in the presence of uncertainty and intertemporality; collective decision making in political institutions; i.e., the democratic sharing of decision power among citizens with conflicting opinions; and fair division of economic and other resources when the recipients have different tastes, needs, or responsibilities.  For each area, the theories propose some normative answers (justified by precise axiomatizations and algorithms) and provide some descriptive models (driven by data from the social and behavioral sciences).",
