 "awd_abstract_narration": "9902417\r\nKouvetakis\r\nThis multidisciplinary program focuses on synthesis of new and technologically important inorganic materials and thin films incorporating elements of groups 13, 14 and 15. A major part of the work involves development of completely novel Si-Ge-C alloys and compound semiconductors which are intended for silicon-based bandgap engineering and lattice matching applications. Wide bandgap optoelectronic nitrides and carbides (including GaN) are prepared from chemically designed C-H- and N-H-free precursors. The goal of this effort is to explore growth of defect-free materials and to develop unusual nanostructured morphologies (quantum dots and wires) using novel synthesis methods. Characterizations involving TEM, XRD, RBS and other techniques (including in situ methods) are used extensively throughout the project to provide rapid feedback about the film microstructure and the quality of the heteroepitaxial growth, thus ultimately leading to better design of the synthetic pathways. In addition, extreme-hardness diamond-like materials based on the Li-Be-B-C-N-O system are synthesized at high pressure using compositionally analogous phases as precursors. Related nanoporous framework systems based on new inorganic C-N compounds of B, Al, Ga, In and Tl are also developed via solution methods. These are expected to have useful properties in adsorption and catalysis. A unique aspect of the research is the design and synthesis of conceptually simple inorganic compounds that provide the necessary building blocks to develop useful solids that cannot be obtained by conventional methods.\r\n\r\nThe work spans a wide range of interdisciplinary projects which are well suited to provide broad preparation and state-of-the-art skills to undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers. Training of highly-qualified future scientists and engineers in new materials synthesis is crucial for our society to maintain its technological edge. We expect to provide fundamental knowledge in novel device chemistry and physics, and thus make important contributions to emerging and future technologies such as the next generation of computers, displays, and communication systems.\r\n\r\n",
