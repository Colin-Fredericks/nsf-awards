 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support participation by US scientists at the Engineering Foundation Conference on Micro- gravity Fluid Physics and Heat Transfer in Oahu, Hawaii, September 19-24, 1999.  Over the last several years many investigators have been carrying out research to understand the role of various transport pheno- mena under reduced gravity.  Experiments have been performed on the Space Shuttle under prolonged duration of microgravity.  These experiments have provided insight into the physics of various phenomena under microgravity conditions and in some cases have demonstrated the lack of understanding of the phenomena.  The conference will provide a forum for the synthesis of the knowledge base that has been developed in micro- gravity heat transfer and in isolating the key issues that need to be addressed in future research.  Technical sessions will be on drops, bubbles, and particles; pool and flow boiling; flow regimes and two phase pressure drop; thermocapillary flows, bio-fluid mechanics; interfacial phenomena; fluid management; and heat pipes.  The proceedings will be published within six months of the conference.",
