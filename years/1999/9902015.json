Known also as the \"Spiderwort Family\", the Commelinaceae includes familiar cultivated ornamentals such as Tradescantia and Zebrina (the spiderwort and wandering jew).  Common wildflowers include various species of Commelina (dayflowers) among other genera.  More numerous but less well known are the tropical genera of the family, some of which are being studied by graduate student Christopher Hardy under the direction of Dr. Jerrold Davis at Cornell University. The goals of this project are to conduct phylogenetic and taxonomic studies within the family on three closely related genera native to the tropical forests of Central and South America.  These genera are Cochliostema, Geogenanthus, and an undescribed genus consisting of an estimated six to seven new species.\r\nPlants of Cochliostema are unusual for the Commelinaceae in that they are found growing primarily high in forest canopies as epiphytes, some with the \"tank plant\" habit that resembles bromeliads vegetatively. Plants of Cochliostema also possess the largest flowers known in the family. Geogenanthus consists of five primarily Amazonian species; low growing and rhizomatous, plants of Geogenanthus are distinguished primarily by their unusual habit of bearing flowers at the soil surface and beneath the leaves.  Finally, plants of the undescribed genus are rosette understory plants often possessing leaves with deep purple beneath and a brilliant white longitudinal stripe above. The objective of the phylogenetic component of this research is to better understand how these three genera and thirteen to fourteen species are related to one another and to other members of the family.  Inferences of phylogenetic relationships will be obtained by analyzing variation in floral and vegetative structure in addition to DNA sequences from nuclear and chloroplast genes. The sequence of evolutionary divergences in this phylogeny will establish hypotheses about the evolution of the large and bizarre floral forms in the group. A taxonomic treatment (monograph) of this group will include keys and new or updated descriptions of all species of the several genera. \r\n",
