Mirrorless laser emission is produced by excitation with electrons in the energy range 1-10 keV in the strong, multiple-scattering regime.  Powders of alumina nanocrystals containing ultraviolet-emitting ions are synthesized by spraying alkoxide precursors through a flame, in a process that results in excellent particle uniformity, controllable size, and high purity.  The use of soluble metallorganic precursors yields unagglomerated powders with compositions identical to the solution compositions and average particle diameters in the 5-100 nm range, at rates of over 250 g/h.  The emissive properties of these materials are then examined by cathodoluminescence in ultrahigh vacuum.  An important objective is to explore the fundamental mechanisms responsible for optical gain in media so highly attenuating that electromagnetic radiation undergoes \"recurrent\" scattering events and is strongly localized.  Excellent training of graduate and postdoctoral students in an emerging cross-disciplinary field is thereby provided.  Suitable transitions and experimental conditions are being studied for efficient, continuous generation of ultraviolet and visible stimulated emission in nanophosphors, utilizing coherent optical techniques to probe their scattering properties. Ultraviolet laser phosphors are expected to be quite unlike other stimulated emission sources by generating speckle-free, incoherent light.\r\n%%%\r\nThis project investigates fundamentally new, quantum optical processes encountered in strongly scattering powders of very small, oxide single crystals.  Electrical generation of continuous, ultraviolet and visible laser emission from nanopowders is expected to lead to numerous applications in conformable light sources, displays, lithography and improved phosphors.  This inter-disciplinary research provides a challenging training ground for graduate students and postdoctoral research associates in an emerging technology area combining state-of-the-art chemistry, electron spectroscopy, and coherent optical measurements.\r\n***  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
