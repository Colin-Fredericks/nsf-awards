 "awd_abstract_narration": "SES 99-75526;  Gregg A. Mitman (Univ. of Oklahoma) \r\n\"Breathing Space:  A History of Asthma and the Environment\"\r\n\r\nBetween 1982 and 1994, the prevalence of asthma -- the leading chronic illness among children in the United States -- increased over 60 percent. Asthma's prevalence is disproportionately higher among inner-city, African-American children than among suburban white children, although studies suggest that this disparity is linked more to socioeconomic status and place than to ethnicity or race. While inadequate access to preventive health care has been suggested as a contributive factor in this incidence pattern, in the last fifteen years investigators have pointed to increased exposure to indoor air pollutants such as tobacco smoke and to indoor allergens associated with dust mites and cockroaches in addition to outdoor air pollutants as important environmental factors in the development and worsening of asthma symptoms among the urban poor. In the l990s, asthma has become identified as a disease of the built environment, a chronic symptom of living in an industrial society, where the risks to environmental pollutants are distributed unequally across ethnic and socioeconomic lines.\r\n\r\nThe built environment has become a subject of increasing interest to environmental historians as attention has shifted away from a historical focus on the \"natural\" environment to urban and industrial spaces. Historical scholarship on the environmental consequences of industrial and urban development has greatly enhanced our understanding of the ways in which changing environmental conditions of the workplace and the city have shaped the economic, political, social, and cultural dimensions of human lives. In addition, scholars have recently begun to historically examine the struggles of scientists and citizens to combat pollution and environmental hazards in the built environment and the integral role that environmental issues have played in political activism for social justice and equality throughout the twentieth century. Despite this recent work, however, and despite the fact that we speak of the environment as though it captures a single entity and diversity of interests, we still have little appreciation for how conceptions and management of the environment of the home, workplace, and recreational area have historically intersected with and diverged from one another.\r\n\r\nBy looking at asthma through a history of place -- from a therapeutic perspective emphasizing environmental control and management, from an etiological perspective implicating environmental factors ranging from allergens to air pollution, and from the perspective of the patient seeking a better quality of life in the rarefied air of mountain resorts or more recently through environmental remediation of the home and workplace -- this project investigates how environmental attitudes toward places of home, work, and play have interacted in medical, scientific, and popular beliefs about asthma over the last 120 years. Unlike infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and tuberculosis, no magic bullet has appeared for the treatment or cure of asthma. Although pharmacological developments have played an important part in therapeutic management, living with asthma has throughout the late-nineteenth and twentieth century always entailed the control and management of the environment, where asthmatics live, work, and play. By attending to the environmental management that physicians and other caretakers prescribed and that chronic sufferers employed in the alleviation of asthma, this project seeks to elucidate historically changing perceptions of the relationship between the environment and health in twentieth-century American culture.\r\n\r\n",
