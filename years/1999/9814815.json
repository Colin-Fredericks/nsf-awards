 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Terence D'Altroy, MS Kirsten Olsen will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. The goal of her project is to examine the relationship between the development of social complexity and organization of activities within individual household units. In recent years archaeologists have focused increasingly on household units. Remains of domestic structures are often abundant and readily identifiable within large sites and thus readily accessible to examination. Secondly it has become increasingly clear that even in complex state level societies most subsistence and manufacturing activities took place in households rather than temples or other ceremonial buildings and thus one can gain insight into broad social organization through study of the smallest fundamental units. A body of anthropological theory predicts that as societies grow complex, social roles become ore tightly defined and this has implications for within household organization. It has also been hypothesized that with increasing complexity inter-household stratification also occurs and that wealth and status differences emerge. MS Olsen will evaluate these predictions through the excavation a four sites in the Cachi Adentro region in the northern Argentina Andes. \r\n\r\nAs the result of long term research in this region Dr. Terence D'Altroy and his colleagues have defined a prehistoric sequence which begins with early hunting and gathering groups and continues through Spanish conquest. During the Regional Development period (ca 1,000-1410 AD) succeeding groups were characterized by increasing levels of social complexity and this provides an excellent context for MS Olsen to examine the change in household organization over time. She will excavate a series of domestic sites from each of two time periods and examine both wealth/status differences between households and the range and spatial distribution of activities within individual units. \r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons. It will provide basic data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed light on the development of social complexity and assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n\r\n",
