 "awd_abstract_narration": "9900534\r\nClaiborne\r\nThe area of flavins and flavoproteins is a broad, but clearly and\r\nsimply defined one.  It covers all aspects of work pertaining to the\r\nchemistry and biology of compounds based on the isoalloxazine nucleus\r\nand on a very few closely related structures.  Because of the\r\nextraordinary versatility of flavin as a prosthetic group and its\r\ninvolvement in a variety of important biological oxidation and reduction\r\nprocesses, this area continues to expand rapidly.  Interest in flavins\r\nranges from theoretical chemistry to medical aspects. The 13th\r\nInternational Symposium on Flavins and Flavoproteins is at\r\nthe University of Konstanz, Konstanz, Germany, August 29-September 4,\r\n1999, as one of a series which has been organized at 3-year intervals\r\nsince 1965.  The last symposium was held in Calgary, Alberta in 1996.\r\nBecause of the continued and increasing pace of research in this area,\r\nit is important that regularly scheduled meetings be held.  Review\r\nlectures will cover the entire field and the meeting should bring\r\ntogether scientists from all over the world from a wide variety of\r\ndisciplines, and promote valuable discussion and exchange of\r\ninformation.  In addition, it should serve the purposes of keeping\r\nexisting workers fully up to date with all aspects of the subject and of\r\ninitiating young investigators into this important area of research.\r\n\r\nRiboflavin (vitamin B2) is an essential nutrient in humans; the\r\nbiochemical basis for this requirement can be explained by the fact that\r\nriboflavin derivatives (FMN and FAD, as abbreviated) serve as essential\r\ncoenzymes for a large number of chemical processes important in human\r\nmetabolism and nutrition.  In many cases the corresponding flavo-enzymes\r\nare involved in the conversion of chemical energy from foodstuffs,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, into ATP, which is the cellular form of stored\r\nenergy required for essential biochemical functions.  Therefore the\r\nstudy of flavins and flavoproteins has direct consequences for human\r\nphysiology and since 1965, researchers from the U.S. and around the world\r\nhave convened every three years to share and discuss their latest\r\nfindings in flavin and flavoprotein research.  In 1999 the 13th\r\nInternational Symposium on Flavins and Flavoproteins is in\r\nKonstanz, Germany; the funds provided by this NSF award are used\r\nspecifically to assist young investigators (primarily Ph.D. students and\r\npost-graduate fellows) from the U.S. in attending this conference.\r\n\r\n",
