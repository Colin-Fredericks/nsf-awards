 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861436\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will address the development of probe technology to speciate toxic algae.   Algal toxins can cause mass mortality of wild and farmed fish, contaminate shellfish beds, and cause human illnesses from consumption of these products.  Once established, harmful algal blooms typically are monospecific.  The bio-optical \"fingerprint\" of the bloom, related to the specific pigment composition and ratios, is distinct to that species.  This lends itself to pigment based analysis techniques for bloom onset identification, tracking, and resource protection.  Phase I will investigate a novel probe for in situ monitoring photosynthetic pigments in aquatic systems, utilizing a simultaneous narrow band Reflectance/Absorption/Fluorometric (RAF) sensor for determination of pigment composition and species identification (specifically red tide algae).\r\n     Commercial applications are expected in substantial markets for scientific instrumentation.  Estimated annual government and private sector expenditures on pigment analysis are projected to be $23 million.  Expenditures associated with collection and processing are estimated at $224 million.\r\n",
