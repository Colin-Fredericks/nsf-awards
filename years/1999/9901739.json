The goal is to increase the experimental resolution to obtain higher quality data and more detailed structural information.  In addition, at least two new experimental approaches will be tested and implemented, including the in-situ application of aligning electric fields to the  liquid-crystal film samples, and the extension of the technique to liquid crystals containing atoms at higher resonance energies.  In the latter case, the liquid crystals can be directly studied with device cells.\r\n%%%\r\nInstrumentation development plays a crucial role in advancing technology.  Developing the hardware and analysis tools to apply resonant x-ray scattering to measure orientational correlations in liquid crystals can be applied to a wide variety of other systems, e.g., organic thin films deposited on metal or semiconductor surfaces, with the organic materials able to be studied directly within device cells.  This is a highly multidisciplinary and well integrated research and education project involving a collaboration between the University of Minnesota and Lucent Technologies, with a strong international component.  It is jointly funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials Resesarch. \r\n",
