 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support an extended visit to Stanford University to allow the author to continue work on two projects investigating the class of minimal submanifolds in Euclidean space that have finite total scalar\r\ncurvature. The author has made progress on the following question: How many points can be omitted by the Gauss image of a complete nonplanar minimally immersed hypersurface with finite total scalar curvature? The conjecture is that two is the maximum possible number of omitted points. In the case of MxM subset RxRxR, two results were previously known. Osserman proved in 1959 that the maximum number of omitted points is bounded by three. Jorge and Meeks gave an argument in 1983 which implies that the maximum\r\nnumber of omitted points is bounded by two in the case where the surface is embedded. The first project is to complete a program developed by the author to prove the conjecture and to show that if two points are omitted, then they must be antipodal. Funds from the grant will allow the author to continue consulting with\r\nseveral geometric analysis experts at Stanford University.\r\n\r\nFor the second project, the author will begin a collaboration with Rafe Mazzeo of Stanford, to generalize connected-sum gluing constructions of Mazzeo and others to give higher-dimensional examples of minimally immersed hypersurfaces with finite total scalar curvature. The success of such a project would establish\r\nthe importance of this class of minimal submanifolds, which the author has studied extensively. It would also lead the way to other major questions in the area, including an investigation of the moduli space problem for various classes of examples. Funds from the grant will also support the collaboration necessary for\r\nthis project.  This POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
