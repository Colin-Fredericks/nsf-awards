When XSB runs in the tabled mode, the system automatically maintains a table of predicate invocations and their answers, using the table for all equivalent calls to the predicate made after the first call.  Current implementations of tabled logic programming systems compute all the answers to a tabled subgoal, regardless of whether all answers are actually needed to correctly answer the top goal.\r\n\r\nWe have identified a concept we call demand propagation which can form the basis of a theory and implementation of \"don't care\" nondeterminism in the context of tabled resolution.  In this approach a programmer can release demand on a goal (for example, after an answer has been returned which shows a negative subgoal in false), in which case that goal and its subgoals will only be evaluated if there are other demands for there answers.  This concept can elegantly solve several search problems that have arisen in our application of XSB.\r\n\r\nThe postdoctoral associate supported by the project is developing both the theoretical underpinnings as well as implementation of a tabled logic programming system based on demand propagation.  The resulting system will be used for doing sophisticated optimizations in two on-going research projects, namely, search space pruning using partial-order reduction in our XSB-based model checker, and reducing query evaluation times in deductive databases.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
