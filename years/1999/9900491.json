An important problem in parallel computing is that of efficient support for collective communication operations. The objective of this study is to develop efficient techniques for collective communication in networks of workstations. Specifically, the research comprises three fundamental components. First, efficient communication techniques are investigated in systems with little or no hardware support for collective communication operations.  Second, hardware-supported techniques are investigated for collective communication in NOWs.  Third, portable and flexible simulation tools are implemented to analyze a variety of communication techniques in networks of workstations under traffic generated by real parallel applications.  The design of efficient collective communication operations in NOWs has a direct impact on improving the performance of numerous parallel computing applications.\r\n",
