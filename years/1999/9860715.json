 "awd_abstract_narration": "9860715\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a planar layer deposition system for freeform fabricating three-dimensional design prototypes.  The planar layer is generated by a container equipped with an adjustable planar nozzle consisting of one or two slotted plates regulated by a motorized position-controlling device of micrometer resolution.  The slotted plates are assembled such that they slide over one another, enabling the nozzle opening to be adjusted, as needed, from fully open to completely closed.  The nozzle can therefore form a semi-solidified sheet of desirable width, which undergoes rapid solidification after deposition on a substrate.  This forms an incremental deposit that contributes toward the final product structure.  The extrusion properties of this system will be tested by making prototypes from a variety of waxes.  By extruding planar layers instead of depositing or curing material, a single bead or beam width at a time, this approach for rapid prototyping components could have build-times a hundred fold less and thus enable solid freeforming in low-volume manufacturing as well as the prototyping process.\r\n     The continuing need to reduce product cycle time requires shorter prototyping time.  Most freeform fabrication schemes, however, are complex and slow, making production rates slow and production runs unattractive, particularly for large parts.  This new freeform technology is expected to fabricate high-strength and high-temperature precision metal and ceramic parts.  Being much simpler and faster than the current freeform fabrication technology, it would decrease product development cost and cycle times.  It may also used in large-scale and controlled manufacturing of advanced materials and structures for aeronautic and space applications.\r\n\r\n",
