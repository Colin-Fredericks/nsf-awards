 "awd_abstract_narration": "This summer REU (Research Experience for Undergraduate) program will be held inthe year 2000 at Washington State University.  The theme will be environmental mathematics.  The participants will work on research problems that deal with environmental issues such as groundwater contamination/remediation and carbon cycle in the biosphere.  they will analyze various mathematical models in the form of coupled ordinary/partial differential equations that describe these environmental problems.  In their analyses, undergraduate-level mathematical concepts such as, isocline analysis, phase plane analysis, Laplace transforms, pseudo-inverses, method of separation of variables and singular perturbation methods will be used.  Also, software such as MATHEMATICA and MATLAB will be employed in carrying out the analyses.  For some problems, computer simulations will be performed making use of LU decomposition techniques and finite-difference methods.  The first two weeks will be devoted to teaching the participants the necessary mathematical concepts and familiarizing them with the on site computer resources.  By exposing the undergraduate participants to interesting and important \"real world\" problems, we intend to make them learn and appreciate the power and usefulness of mathematics in real life.  Our hope is to provide a research experience that will get the students excited about applied mathematics and will attract them into doing graduate research in mathematics.",
