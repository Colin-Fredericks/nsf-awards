Understanding this system requires a detailed knowledge of both the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of its many steps. Although the kinetics of most of its steps have been established by the rich variety of spectroscopic techniques now available, the thermodynamic parameters of most of its steps remain unknown. Kinetics identify the path of the photosynthetic process but it is thermodynamics that identifies how the solar energy is stored. The recently developed method of pulsed, wide-band, time-resolved photoacoustics allows one to uniquely determine the changes of volume and heat or enthalpy in the steps of a photochemical reaction. Electrostriction, a major contribution to volume change described thermodynamically by Drude and Nernst a century ago, must occur in electron transfer reactions where there is a separation of charge. Electrostriction in photosynthetic systems provides information on the dielectric coefficient and compressibility of the reaction center protein, quantities directly related to protein structure and function. The volume changes are a remarkably simple measure of the primary quantum yield of photosynthesis. The enthalpy is a direct measure of the efficiency of the photosynthetic system. Since the free energy of many steps is known from equilibrium or redox potential measurements, the entropy can be calculated from the measured enthalpy. The change in entropy is a measure of the order of the system, reflecting changes in conformation and hydration. These data can now be obtained from living cells using a novel analysis of photoacoustic data. This by-passes tedious and often damaging manipulations of the photosynthetic material necessary to prepare reaction centers. Measurements will be made on reaction centers of photosystem I and II and on live cyanobacteria of a single species to obtain a set of consistent data.\r\n\r\nThe primary productivity of the oceans is fundamental to life on this planet. The absolute method to determine this productivity is based on 14C fixation and is slow and labor intensive.  Photoacoustics is unique in directly determining the energetics or efficiency of the photosynthetic process. The sensitivity of the photoacoustic method will be increased beyond its present point of detecting phytoplankton at levels of the open ocean. Different wavelengths of light will be used to determine the contribution of each of the three major taxa of phytoplankton in a sample. One can determine the useful photosynthetic rate versus light intensity response of the phytoplankton, as well as the optical cross-section, which is related to the size of the photosynthetic unit, by the photoacoustic method. These data are measures of the adaptation of the phytoplankton to changes in the environment such as the light regime. A long range goal is to adapt this photoacoustic methodology to shipboard or portable apparatus using light emitting or laser diodes and compact data acquisition systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
