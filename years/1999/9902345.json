Theory and phylogenetics suggest that androdioecy is derived from dioecy in Datisca.  Furthermore, floral morphology suggests that hermaphrodites are modified females, while males have an ancestral form.  The overall goal of this research is to understand the evolution of androdioecy from dioecy.  Crosses and molecular markers will be used to investigate  the genetic basis of sex determination in the androdioecious plant, Datisca glomerata and its dioecious sister-species, D. cannabina.  Furthermore,  a search for sex ratio distorters will be made in natural populations of dioecious D. cannabina to test the possibility that female-biased sex ratios were involved in the evolution of androdioecy.\r\n\r\nBreeding-system evolution is one of the most tractable and best-studied evolutionary processes in plants.  Thus it provides an excellent model for evolution as a whole.  Furthermore, because most breeding system theory was developed for other breeding systems, androdioecy provides an independent test of the rules thought to control breeding system evolution. These studies will help explain the genetic processes allowing androdioecy to evolve through natural selection in Datisca.  More broadly, they will  illuminate the role of genetics in breeding-system evolution and in adaptive evolution as a whole.  \r\n",
