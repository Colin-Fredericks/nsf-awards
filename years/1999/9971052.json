 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deals with properties of solutions to elliptic and \r\nparabolic equations of second order, such as estimates for Green's \r\nfunctions and harmonic or caloric measures, uniqueness of blowup solutions \r\nto semilinear elliptic equations, regularity of solutions to quasilinear \r\nand nonlinear equations under weak structural assumptions. Part 1 of the \r\nproject is devoted to the behavior of solutions near the boundary. Special \r\nattention is paid to the conditions on the coefficients, which guarantee \r\nthe absolute continuity of harmonic and caloric measures with respect to \r\nthe surface measure on the boundary. Such Dini-type conditions are known \r\nfor equations in the divergence form. The study of equations in the \r\nnon-divergence form needs quite different technique. Part 1 also includes \r\nthe problem of uniqueness of solutions to semilinear equations, which blow \r\nup on the boundary. Our recent results show that positive solutions, which \r\nvanish on the boundary, have same rate of decay. We expect blowup solution \r\nnear a portion of the boundary must have same rate of growth. Part 2 of the \r\nproject deals with the regularity of solutions of quasilinear equations \r\nwith minimal smoothness with respect to the gradient of solution, and of \r\nfully nonlinear equations without the concavity conditions with respect to \r\nthe second derivatives.\r\n\r\n        An essential part of the project deals with boundary properties \r\nof solutions of partial differential equations with non-smooth \r\ncoefficients. Such equations appear in the investigation of different \r\nprocesses in composite materials, porous media, chemistry, biology, etc. \r\nThe boundary properties of solutions are especially important, because they \r\nare \"responsible\" for interaction of a given object with its environment \r\n(heat emission, radiation, etc). In many situations, in order to get a \r\ndesirable effect in a given region, one can only act on its boundary. The \r\nstudy of behavior of solutions near the boundary allows us to make such \r\nboundary control more predictable and effective. The blowup solutions of \r\nsemilinear equations are associated with certain processes in biology, \r\nmedicine, nuclear engineering, where their control cannot be overestimated. \r\nIn this project, we also discuss the regularity of solutions of nonlinear \r\nequations. Positive results of such sort are interesting not only from the \r\ntheoretical point of view, they also give the background for numerical \r\nsolution of equations.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
