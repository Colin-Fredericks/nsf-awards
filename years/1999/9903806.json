 "awd_abstract_narration": "9903806 \r\nAhrens \r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigators propose to continue measurements of shock temperatures in order to determine the high-pressure melting point of the major mantle minerals, MgSiO3 (perovskite) and MgO (periclase) of the lower mantle of the Earth.  The lower mantle extends from a depth of 670 to 2900 km and the corresponding pressures are 24 to 126 GPa.  Model calculations of the lower-most mantle yield temperatures of 3500 to 4000 K.  However, present laboratory (diamond cell melting) results that could place firm bounds on the peak temperatures of the lower mantle for MgSiO3 are very discrepant by nearly 2000 K.  A similar discrepancy exists between a single experimental data set for periclase and a melting curve predicted on the basis of a well-accepted theoretical model.  Direct comparison between seismic velocities in these minerals at high pressure and high temperature with the seismic velocities at depths of the Earth would allow constraints on the temperature variations in the lower mantle which drive convection in the Earth.  The proposed determination of melting is based on previous research on shock melting of minerals such as Mg2SiO4 shocked to the pressure regime of the stability of the assemblage periclase plus MgSi03 (perovskite), and is expected to be accomplished using techniques the investigators have developed for preheating samples to temperatures of 1300 C prior to impact.  The 1995 discovery of a 1-40 km thick apparently partially-molten region at the base of the mantle has motivated their plan to measure equations of state, sound velocities, and shock temperatures in molten silicates such as anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) diopside (MgCaSi2O6), fayalite (Fe2SiO4), and enstatite (MgSiO3) to pressures of ~150 GPa.  These data will permit extending previous knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of molten silicates into a pressure regime where these data can be applied to understand the processes which give rise to this partially molten layer at the base of the mantle. \r\n",
