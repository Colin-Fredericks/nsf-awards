Gary, and Jeong Woo Lee, Department of Physics, New Jersey Institute of Technology, to pursue with Drs. Hong Sik Yun, Astronomy Department, Seoul National University, and Gwang-Son Choe, Tongmyong University of Information Technology, Pusan, for 36 months, a program of cooperative research in solar physics.  The scientific objectives of this research are to understand (1) the magnetic field configuration of the sun and how its evolution is associated with the formation, activation, and eruption of prominences, (2) the physical connection between prominences and flares, (3) the magnetic field changes associated with solar flares and (4) the energetic electrons in solar flares.  These investigations will contribute to understanding the role of magnetic fields in two big solar mysteries: prominences and flares.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. solar group at New Jersey Institute of Technology operates two major solar observatories: Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) and the solar array at Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO).  BBSO provides high-resolution observations of the photosphere and the chromosphere through the combined tools of photometry and polarimetry which will complement ongoing US Space missions which image the corona and the transition region.  The solar array at OVRO offers imaging spectroscopy at microwave wavelengths which provide key parameters of solar flares and active regions. The Korean solar astronomers will participate in aspects of data reduction and analysis of the large database gathered at these observatories using their expertise in radiative transfer applied to solar spectral lines, and modeling of solar filaments.  This project will strengthen collaboration between highly respected U.S. and Korean research teams.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).\r\n***\r\n",
