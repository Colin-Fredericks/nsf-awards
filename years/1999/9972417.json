 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe investigator plans to do work in two principal areas, sums and self-normalized sums. He (together with a co-author) intends to write up a very accurate result which can be applied to the approximation of tail probabilities of both real-valued and Banach space-valued partial sums of independent  variates. Armed with certain functions defined from the marginal distributions of the variates, approximations of partial sum quantiles and p-th moments of great precision should follow. Secondly, the proposer (and co-authors) will address questions concerning exponential moment and tail probability upper bounds for self-normalized martingales. It is anticipated that statistical applications will occur as a consequence.\r\n\tProbabilistic and statistical issues arise in a broad variety of theoretical and applied contexts. Most commonly the issues involve the probability of an event, the expectation of a random function, or a test of hypothesis. Real world applications of such results are wide-spread, extending from theory to data analysis in the social sciences, pharmaceuticals, finance, economics, engineering, the physical sciences, and the performance of algorithms. The investigator has worked in the area of sums of independent random variables for many years. He (together with co-authors) now is pursuing results of very refined precision. Included in this list are substantial improvements in the approximation of tail probabilities of partial sums and the location of their quantiles, expectation bounds, plus tail probability, exponential and moment generating function bounds for so-called self-normalized martingales.",
