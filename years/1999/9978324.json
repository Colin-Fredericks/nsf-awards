This geoscience education program provides an innovative approach to science teacher professional development focused on geoscience education and technology training in coastal marine environments.  The institute proposes to improve the quality of geoscience education by offering North Carolina middle and high school teachers geoscience content, laboratory, field, and technology training in coastal themes relating to barrier island systems, meteorology, hydrogeology, nearshore environments, and marine biotoxins.  The 1999 Institute will build closer relationships between K-12 education, universities, business, industry, government, and community partners in both North Carolina and Florida.  The participation of these partners will play a fundamental role in bringing about widespread science educational reform in the local schools.  The objectives of the proposed North Carolina Science Teacher Institute compliment the priorities and recommendations of the National Science Foundation's Directorate for Geosciences (GEO), the Geoscience Education Working Group Report (1996), the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996), and the North Carolina Science Education Standards.  The primary Objectives of the program are to develop a stronger teaching force to improve the knowledge, understanding, appreciation, and implementation of geoscience content and technology at the middle and high school level, and to promote long-term collaborations between university research and K-12 education, as well as, local government agencies, businesses, industries and the community in an effort to keep the K-12 education abreast of the rapid advances in science and technology.  The expansion of this Institution to other coastal states offers an innovative approach in changing, developing, and strengthening partnerships between research and education throughout the nation.  The Institute also provides teachers innovative approaches to geoscience knowledge and problem solving skills through a combination of research and technology-based learning tools.\r\n",
