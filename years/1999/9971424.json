 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the research project is to continue the development of\r\nnew methodologies involving mathematical control theory, stochastic\r\nanalysis, statistics of random processes, and financial mathematics for the\r\npurpose of understanding and solving complex problems in financial decision\r\nmaking. The heart of the proposed research involves the development of\r\ncontinuous time, risk sensitive control models for making optimal investment\r\ndecisions. Such models will feature underlying economic factors that are\r\nmodeled explicitly as stochastic processes, the infinite horizon criterion\r\nof maximizing the portfolio's risk adjusted growth rate, and constraints on\r\nthe trading strategies. This basic theory will be extended in at least three\r\ndirections. The first is to analogous models in discrete time, thereby\r\nleading to additional computational methods. The second is to continuous\r\ntime models which include transaction costs, thereby leading to the study of\r\nquasi-variational inequalities. And a third extension will be to cases where\r\none or more of the underlying factors are not observable, thereby involving\r\nin the case of discrete time the theory of hidden Markov models.\r\n\r\n    The research is important for two principal reasons. First, the new\r\nmathematical methodologies are likely to enhance the competitiveness of U.S.\r\nfinancial institutions. Second, the research will lead to a better\r\nunderstanding about risk management and how investor decisions affect and\r\nare affected by financial markets and the economy. For example, an important\r\nspecial case of the basic model is where the assets are bonds and the\r\nunderlying factors are macroeconomic variables. The anticipated results will\r\nelucidate the relationships between investors' buying and selling decisions,\r\nthe level of interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables such as\r\nunemployment rates. By looking at cases where the underlying factors\r\ncorrespond to financial derivatives, another likely by-product of this\r\nresearch is a better understanding of how to manage risk by trading futures\r\nand options. Additional versions of the model can be used to study the\r\ninterplay between macroeconomic variables and the stock market. Indeed,\r\nlikely to emerge from this project are new explanations of business cycles\r\nand the long range dependence of stock market prices that have been reported\r\nin the financial literature.\r\n",
