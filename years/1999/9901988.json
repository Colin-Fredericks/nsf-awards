 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kronecker product has a rich and very pleasing algebra that supports a wide range of fast, elegant, and practical algorithms. Three trends in scientific computing suggest that this important matrix operation will have an increasingly greater role to play in the future. First, the application areas where Kronecker products abound are all thriving. These include signal processing, image processing, semidefinite programming, and quantum computing. Second, sparse factorizations and Kronecker products are proving to be the preferred way to look at fast linear transforms. Researchers have taken the Kronecker methodology as developed for the fast Fourier transform and used it to build exciting alternatives. Third, as computers get more powerful, researchers are more willing to entertain problems of high dimension and this leads to Kronecker products whenever low-dimension techniques are \"tensored\" together. Moreover, Kronecker products are a useful way to keep track of data motion in memory hierarchies that are the hallmark of advanced machines. \r\n\r\nIn light of these developments, the goal of this project is to widen the use of the Kronecker product in numerical linear algebra. The first step is to study the nearest Kronecker product problem because progress in this area will lead to new and interesting ideas for preconditioners. Other applications that require Kronecker product approximations have been identified and many new methods are called for. All of the algorithmic work will culminate in production of Matlab and C++ libraries.  The research will heighten the profile of the Kronecker product throughout the field of matrix computations and thereby make it easier for researchers to spot Kronecker \"opportunities\" in their work. By building an \"infrastructure\" of effective Kronecker-product algorithms, applications that feature the operation will proliferate at an even greater rate.\r\n",
