 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification program sub-element of the Interfacial,Transport and Separations program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Dr. Ralph  Yang at the University of Michigan.  The proposed research concerns the study of novel adsorbents for three basic types of separations problems.  In particular, emphasis is given to those involving olefeneparaffin systems.  The basic for the separation in these systems is thought to be largely due to the preferential pi-bonding between the olefenic species and the adsorbent, which is not present with a low molecularweight paraffin species.  The PI's research proposes to continue with the preparation of both silver and copper-based sorbents for these separations. In addition, the PI is proposing the study of both dioxin adsorption, using silver salts supported on silcia supports, and NO  adsorption from hot combustion gases.  Experimental work is described in each of these ares.  Futhermore, an initio molcular\r\norbital calculations are planned in an attempt to provide a more detailed understanding of the catiion-sorbate binding step that is an essential part of the adsorption mechanism in each of these systems.",
