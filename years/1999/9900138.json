 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims at developing novel particulate composites using cenospheres in a polymer or cement matrix and characterizing their mechanical (constitutive and fracture) and thermal properties. Cenospheres being reclaimed product from the fly ash of the thermal power plants, are inexpensive and their use in a scientific manner as envisaged in this proposal would result in material conservation and also reduce environmental problems asociated with their disposal in landfills. A comprehensive processing scheme for preparing these composites will be developed for both the polymer and cement matrices. The hollow ceramic cenospheres are ideally suited to make light weight material and, the effect of the cenosphere content, size and their distribution in the matrix on the resulting material properties will be investigated in detailed. Suitable cenosphere surface treatments will be investigated to tailor the interaction at the cenosphere-matrix interface and the effect of such interface customization on the material properties will be studied. Based on these investigations, suitable models for design and synthesis of cenosphere composites will be developed. The results will also provide a basic for developing and valading constitutiive failure models based on continuum or micromechanical theories for particular composites. The synergiistic effect of combining cenosphere characteristics with those imparted by the continuous matrix can be exploited for a range of applications, including light weight impact resistant and energy absorbing materials and structures, high specific strength materialss for construction of boats and civil structures and light weight thermal insulation materials.***",
