 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support research on nonlinear evolution partial differential\r\nequations arising from continuum mechanics.  Examples include the \r\nEuler and Navier-Stokes equations for compressible and incompressible inviscid \r\nand viscous fluids, the equations of electro-magneto field dynamics for electrically \r\nconducting compressible viscous fluids, the equations of elasticity, nonlinear \r\nBoltzmann type equations in kinetic theory of rarefied gases, and equations for \r\ncombustion, multiphase flows, and fluids with chemical reactions.\r\nThe main objective is to gain better qualitative and quantitative understanding \r\nof the behavior of solutions, using mathematically rigorous analysis and numerical \r\nsimulations.  The focus will be on understanding the effects of small scale dissipations and\r\nrelaxations on the large scale fluid motions; development of singularities\r\nand their stuctures from smooth flows; nonlinear stability or instability \r\nand interactions for basic linear and nonlinear waves; design and analysis of\r\nhigh resolution numerical methods for large scale calculations of discontinous flows;\r\nfluid-dynamic limit problems for various kinetic models; and problems in multi-space\r\ndimensions and in thermo-nonequilibrium.  One of the main ideas is to \r\novercome the difficulties that are encountered at the macroscopic level by\r\ndesigning and analyzing approximate models which are physically more \r\nfundamental and mathematically tractable. \r\n  \r\nMany interesting phenomena in the mechanics of continua can be described by \r\nmathematical models that involve nonlinear partial differential equations. \r\nA better understanding of these models has important applications in many sciences such as \r\nmechanics, turbulence theory, geophysics, meteorology, aeronautics, chemical \r\nengineering, etc. This award will support work on these fundamental models.\r\nThe goal is to gain better qualitative understanding and to improve the foundations\r\nfor effective and accurate numerical simulations.\r\n\r\n",
