More specifically, the research will focus on establishing sharp metrical bounds on the rotation of Green lines and elucidating their relationship with the properties of harmonic measure and conformal mappings. The research should provide a clearer understanding of the connection between the bounds for simply connected and nonsimply connected domains. Binder will also explore possible applications of these ideas  to complex dynamics.\r\n\r\nConformal mappings and harmonic measure are classical objects, extensively used for more than a hundred years in different areas of mathematics, as well as in engineering and physics. By contrast, the theory of systems with chaotic (or \"fractal\") behavior is one of the newest and most active areas of mathematics, with a multitude of applications to biology, physics, computer science and engineering. Binder's project seeks to employ the techniques and ideas of the modern theory of chaotic systems in order to investigate time-honored questions concerning conformal mappings and harmonic measure, in the hope of shedding new light on these venerable subjects and opening doors to potentially exciting applications in both mathematics and the applied sciences.\r\n\r\n",
