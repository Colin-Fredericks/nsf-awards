Their importance is highlighted  by their applications in Theoretical Computer Science.  The PIs continue their work on this subject and investigate three different aspects of  representations.  One of the goals of the PIs is to discover dense graphs not containg some fixed graph G as a subgraph.  This problem is wide open once G is bipartite.  The PIs search for algebraic or geometric representation of the appropriate graphs (e.g., Ramanujan graphs, norm graphs, polarity graphs).  In another aspect of graph representations the type of representation is given and one tries to find the most efficient one for a class of graphs.  The PI and the coPI investigate ``worst-case'' and ``average-case'' efficiencies of important representations.  The methods here also include probability theory.  Finally, the PIs apply appropriately chosen representations as tools in the  determination of some other parameter or property of a combinatorial structure of interest. \r\n\r\n\r\nGraphs are made up of \"vertices\" and \"edges\" connecting some pairs of vertices. Behind the transparent definition hidden is a vast amount of  complexity.  One of the reasons the study of graphs is of paramount interest  is their wide applicability in Computer Science.  The \"thinking\" of today's  computers is modeled by graphs.  Algorithms often use specific exmples of graphs having a certain appropriately chosen structure.  The speed of an  algorithm could depend on the attributes of the graphs employed.  The problems  arising are part of a broader research area within Combinatorics, which aims at obtaining information about global properties of graphs under some local restrictions.  The PIs tackle specific problems of this type.  They apply ideas from algebra and geometry to obtain representations of graphs with excellent global properties.  Another aspect of graph representations is the following.  Expensive computer (disk) space can be saved by communicating the structure of a graph to the computer efficiently.  In these problems the type of the representation, that is the the way of communication is fixed, and one tries to determine how well different graphs can be represented.  The  PI and the coPI investigate \"economic\" ways to represent graphs using  representations from algebra and geomtry. \r\n",
