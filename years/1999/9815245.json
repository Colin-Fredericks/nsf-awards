 "awd_abstract_narration": "9815245\r\nMajumdar\r\n\r\nThis award supports the participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Molecular and Microscale Thermophysical Phenomena in Nanotechnology, to be held in Sendai, Japan, from August 8-11, l999.  The co-organizers are Professors Arun Majumdar at the University of California, Berkeley and Susumu Kotake at Toyo University in Japan.  The seminar will provide a cross-disciplinary and international forum for discussion and presentation of the latest results in the area of molecular and microscale thermophysical phenomena related to nanotechnology.  Seminar discussion will be held in the following five areas:  1) transport phenomena in micro- and nanostructures;  2) new experimental techniques, sensors, detectors and devices;  3) interfacial and surface phenomena;  4) molecular clustering and phase transformation; and  5)  highly non-equilibrium and complex transport phenomena. \r\n\r\nExploration, understanding, and control of physical phenomena at the nanometer scales have received intense attention in recent years.  In the past, most of this effort has been directed towards understanding the electronic and materials behavior of nanostructures.  \r\nHowever, the thermophysics of nanostructures and nanodevices have not been adequately addressed.  It must be recognized that although the nature of physical phenomena at nanometer scales can be quite diverse, they must all satisfy the basic laws of thermodynamics.  Hence, thermophysics at nanometer scales provides a unique window to study a wide variety of phenomena.  Only recently have researchers started working on microscale thermophysics to study short time scale and small length scale phenomena.  These studies have led to key insight and promising prospects of research in this area.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Following the seminar, it is anticipated that the presentations will be prepared and, if accepted, published in Microscale Thermophysical Engineering.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
