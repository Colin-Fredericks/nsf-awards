The factorial designs, however, do not always provide sufficient information for characterizing the underlying trajectories of neurotoxic effects over time.  Often the lowest dose that induces the toxic effects is identified using analysis of variance or multiple comparison, and is used to derive a safety standard, without accounting for the magnitude of the effects, or the underlying dose-response relationship.  Despite the US EPA's recommendation in its latest risk assessment guidelines, the use of dose-response modeling and subsequent estimation of a benchmark dose, a new approach leading to better safety standards have not been produced.  This project proposes to conduct dose-time-response modeling of neurobehavioral toxicity using linear/non-linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models. Models that characterize transient and competing effects are considered.  The use of mixed effects makes it possible to quantify risk for targeted individuals or groups.  The project attempts to develop semi-parametric estimation methods for fitting mixed effects models, exploring the use of GEE-based EM algorithm, for example.  It is hoped that such semi-parametric procedures may not only generate more robust estimates, but also simplify the computational aspects of mixed-effects models.  A second technical focus is to develop semi-parametric, bootstrap-enhanced calibration methods for estimating benchmark doses.  In the context of neurotoxicity risk assessment, benchmark doses lies along a contour line on the dose-time-response surface.  The bootstrap calibration methods can overcome the limitation associated with small sample size, and illustrate sampling uncertainty or variation of the benchmark dose estimates.  A third technical challenge is to develop informative and efficient designs beyond the factorial ones for neurotoxicity screening experiments in terms of dose-time spacing to achieve maximal information recovery on dose-response (e.g. peak effect time), and reliable estimation of benchmark doses.  The project utilizes the database of the IPCS Collaborative Study and the EPA studies on Neurobehavioral Screening Methods.\r\n\r\nNeurotoxic effects are recognized as one of the leading workplace disorders.  There are currently more than 65,000 chemical substances that are used in the USA, yet it is not known how many may be neurotoxic in humans.  It is estimated, however, that a large number of the more than 500 registered active pesticide ingredients affect the nervous system of the targeted species to varying degrees.  Of the 588 chemicals listed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, 167 affected the nervous system or behavior at some exposure level.  As a result of the impact of neurotoxicity on public health, there are increasing scientific interests in neurotoxic risk to humans, as well as increasing regulatory needs for developing better safety standards against environmental exposure.  In summary, this project 1) develops effective design protocols for neurotoxicity screening tests to improve risk characterization; 2) develops and applies better statistical methods to quantify neurobehavioral disorders; and 3) develops and tests better procedures for computing regulatory standards for potential neurotoxicants.  The methods developed in this project are likely to enhance the scientific foundation of risk assessment, and hence to help improve environmental regulatory policies.  This project is supported jointly by the Statistics Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) in MPS.\r\n\r\n",
