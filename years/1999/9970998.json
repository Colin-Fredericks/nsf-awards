The \r\nfirst question addressed is the existence and convergence of nonlinear \r\nobservers using a generalization of Lyapunov functions.  We also address \r\nthe development of efficient computational schemes for nonlinear filtering \r\nand smoothing.  The other half of the project is to develop effective \r\nparameter estimation schemes for nonlinear systems, particularly, systems \r\nwith polynomial nonlinearities.  We will focus on identifying systems \r\nwithin some model class such as the feedback linearizable systems.  We \r\nshall use the properties particular to nonlinear systems such as the \r\npresence of bifurcations and harmonic interactions to assist in their \r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nThroughout science and engineering, models of dynamical systems are \r\nused to describe the evolution of real world processes.  Over small \r\nexcursions, linear models can be quite accurate but over larger motions \r\none generally must rely on nonlinear models.  The estimation of the state \r\nof a linear system from linear observations is a well developed area and \r\neffective and computationally feasible methods are well-known. But the \r\ntheory and methodology for estimating the state of a nonlinear system \r\nwhile quite extensive is not completely satisfactory. There do exist \r\nglobally convergent, computationally feasible techniques for most \r\nnonlinear systems.  Similarly the identification of the parameters of a \r\nlinear system is a mature field but the identification of the parameters of a \r\nnonlinear system is much less developed. We are proposing research in \r\nestimating the state and identifying the parameters of nonlinear systems \r\nusing a variety of new methods that show considerable promise.\r\n",
