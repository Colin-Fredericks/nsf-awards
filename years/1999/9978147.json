 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the amount of data processed by a computer system increases, new, more complex and flexible algorithms and data representations are required. At the same time, new visualization and interaction techniques are required to help the user access, understand, and manipulate the data. The ability to steer a computation and modify the models during the course of a simulation is required in order to use those simulations as an exploration tool.  All this means that traditionally separate tasks, including model construction, numerical simulation and visualization, should be tightly integrated.  There is a need for new data representations that are scalable, robust, and adaptive to accommodating a variety of computational and visualization algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis project will explore combined representations of 2D and 3D geometry. The immediate goal is to find adequate representations for computationally challenging fluid flow simulations with dynamic boundaries. These representations will enable hierarchical solvers to compute successive approximations to the flow, interactive visualization of the 3D fluid, and interactive steering of the computational parameters (e.g. precision) and physical parameters (e.g. boundary conditions) of the simulations. The project will test the viability of these representations in an interactive system for fluid flow simulations.\r\n",
