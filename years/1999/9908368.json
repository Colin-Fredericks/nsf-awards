The experiments will provide detailed information on the evolution of variants under different loading conditions and will be compared to the PIs \"multivariant\" micromechanics model. In addition, results will give insight into the assumptions for transformation strains used in plasticity-based SMA constitutive models. The work represents investigation of aspects of SMA behavior that have not yet been examined: while the materials science community has dealt with identification of martensitic variant structure, and the mechanics community has dealt with macroscale modeling, a direct understanding of exactly which variants form under applied load and precisely how that translates into macroscopic strain for different loading conditions has not been studied. Yet these issues must be understood to make significant progress in SMA research and applications.\r\n",
