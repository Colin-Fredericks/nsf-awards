The stress variations are of great importance\r\nfor basic science and many engineering applications.   The present research is\r\naimed at the investigation of the stresses developing in granular materials\r\nutilizing grid-based tactile pressure technology.  A development of a\r\ncalibration and interpretation methodology for the tactile sensors is\r\nproposed.  Experimental program investigating the state of stress in granular\r\nmaterials under fundamental and engineering applications is planned.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of discontinuous (discrete, granular) materials is an important\r\nfactor in many disciplines. These materials display unique behavior in the form\r\nof volume change during shear and arching. The fundamental mechanism of arching\r\nrelates to the ability of discrete units to transfer loads through interaction\r\nin a preferable geometry and thus to bridge between the zone (or point) of load\r\napplication to the zone (or points) of reaction.  These features result in a\r\nunique load transformation and stress distribution within discontinuous\r\nmaterials and on the boundary between them and solid surfaces.  Accurate\r\nmeasurements of stress distribution are cardinal therefore for the\r\nunderstanding of the physical phenomena as well as the evaluation of design\r\ncriteria and monitoring performance.  \r\n\r\nThe existing methods of evaluating stress distribution in a granular mass rely\r\nmostly on the use of buried load cells.  These measurements are difficult to\r\nperform and are limited in their ability to capture the stress variation.\r\n\r\nA new technology, which makes use of flexible, grid-based, tactile pressure\r\nsensors, allows to measure stresses at a large number of points in proximity to\r\none another, hence providing a realistic normal stress distribution.  Their\r\nflexibility overcomes the intruding effect introduced by rigid load cells and\r\nthus allows for measurements that better represent the existing stress\r\nconditions. The application of the tactile pressure technology to granular\r\nmaterials requires adaptation and calibration due do its innovative principle\r\nof operation.  A preliminary viability study was conducted at the Geotechnical\r\nEngineering Research Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Lowell,\r\nwhich focused on evaluating the tactile sensor technology, overcoming the\r\ndifficulties associated with it and utilizing the method in exploratory\r\napplications.  The results of this study have provided the basis for the\r\npresent research.\r\n\r\nThe proposed experimental program includes enhancement of the calibration and\r\ntesting of the system followed by basic and applicative research applications. \r\nThe obtained results and analyses (numerical and analytical) are expected to\r\nprovide (a) Basis for the implementation of a new technology to granular\r\nmaterials.  (b) Significant insight to evaluate current knowledge and (c)\r\nActual stress measurements and behavior of granular materials and structures\r\nfrom a previously unobtained perspective.  The use of the technology in\r\neducation is promising, allowing for demonstrations elucidating the concept of\r\nstresses.\r\n***",
