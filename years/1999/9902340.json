Research and clinical studies are, thus, unable to make meaningful assessments of relative rotations of the hip and knee and are, therefore, unable to determine critical information about human movement and the effects of pathology.  At the University of Iowa a prototype femoral tracking device has been developed that makes it feasible to track the femur using a non-invasive technique.  The goal of this project is to complete development and testing of this femoral tracking device. In order to accomplish this goal, three objectives have been identified:\r\n\r\nObjective 1: Obtain better models of the femoral condyles using CT imaging techniques in combination with Image Analysis and Rapid Prototyping.\r\nBased on our initial work the importance of the condylar pads in maintaining the position of the device has been appreciated.  Working with individuals in Radiology, the Imaging Analysis Center, and the Rapid Prototyping Center, models using the data on four individuals of different body builds will be generated.  Using a new high resolution CT scanner, images of the distal femur will be acquired and transferred in the Imaging Analysis Center.  Doctoral students will be trained in the use of Voxblast software to edit the volume and generate a polygonal surface of the femur.  These surfaces will be used to create a composite model of the condyles.  The polygonal surface will be converted into stereo lithography format and can be shipped to the Prototyping Center. Fused deposition modeling will be used for rapid prototyping models of the knee that can be used to create the condylar pads.\r\n\r\nObjective 2: Engineer the design to obtain a light weight and adjustable device that minimizes the medial profile and optimizes the fit on a variety of subjects.\r\nWorking with personnel in the Engineering Design and Prototyping Center the design of the device will be optimized by re-engineering the current prototype.  These advanced designs will be tested on a variety of subjects to judge: comfort, fit, stability, reliability, and validity.  Subjects will be tested during walking and running activities. Validity will be assessed using a lower limb rotation test with the knee straight.\r\n\r\nObjective 3: Establish the reliability and validity of the new design.\r\nThe design of the device will be tested on 20 subjects, who span a variety of body builds, over five different days in order to establish the reliability of the device during walking, jogging and stair gait.  The motion analysis system and associated software in our lab will be used to collect and process the kinematic and kinetic data.  Working with Drs. Pierrynowski and Ball at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, the validity of the device will be determined by comparing measures obtained with bone pin data to measures obtained with the device during walking, running, and step-up activities. \r\n\r\nIdentifying a strategy that will enable the accurate measurement of femoral rotations will have implications for understanding normal movement, as well as abnormal movement in patients with hip, knee, and foot pathology.  The area of immediate interest for our group is the ACL deficient patient population where control of rotations with loss of the ACL becomes a critical issue that is thought to lead to instability in the knee.  \r\n\r\n",
