 "awd_abstract_narration": "BENNETT COLLEGE\r\n\r\nBennett College is a small Afro-American women's liberal arts college with a student population of 624 (Fall 1998) located in Greensboro, North Carolina. Like most other colleges, ratio of graduates in SMET fields and the number of entering freshmen with SMEET fields as the intended major is very small. Only about 21% of entering freshmen complete graduation in SMET fields in stipulated period of four-years.\r\n\r\nThis project is designed to minimize the concerns contributing to this situation including: inadequate preparation of freshmen, lack of appropriate technology infrastructure and its integration in SMIET curriculum, traditional instructional approach that does not motivate students to deal with the SMET curriculum challenges, and lack of good study habits. The strategies proposed to alleviate these concerns are summarized below.\r\n\r\n1. Develop a Pre-freshman Summary Academy (PSA) for entering freshmen to thoroughly prepare them through fast review and academic enrichment activities and engage these core group of students as project assistants for faculty research, computer lab assistants, and cooperative learning group leaders.\r\n\r\n2. Provide technology infrastructure in the form of testing and tutorial center, mounted projection systems for the classrooms, upgrading science labs, mini computer laboratories in dormitories, and computers/printers for the departments.\r\n\r\n3. Revamping the SMET curriculum and instructional delivery system especially for gateway courses, and incorporating research component in all junior/senior level SMET courses. The delivery system for gateway courses will include the use of multimedia electronic lecture notes with simulated lab experiments that will also be used by students as tutorials, and on-line testing and management system that will provide tools for frequent quizzes, practice tests, and actual simulated tests*.\r\n\r\n4.\tFaculty training in the' use of technology for modification of the materials and for implementing IIDS.\r\n\r\nThe PSA for 50 students every year and reduction in attrition expected because of the use of EIDS in all SMET course at freshmen and sophomore level courses is expected to significantly increase the number of SMET graduates even before the tenure of this project.\r\n\r\nBennett College is committed to provide all additional resources not requested in this project to ensure successful implementation of the initiatives proposed in this project and to maintain the same after the funding period.\r\n\r\n",
