The co-organizers are Professor Kirk Schanze of the University of Florida and Professor Suehiro Iwata of the Okazaki National Research Institute in Japan.  The theme of the seminar is broadly centered on the topic of photosynthesis and energy conversion (artificial photosynthesis).  The seminar will focus on significant advances that have been made in these areas during the previous two decades as well as topics of current interest in the field.  The topics include:  1) semiconductor photoelectrochemistry, dye-sensitization of semiconductor colloids and application of photocatalysis to environmental remediation;  2) fundamental and applied topics in molecular and supramolecular photochemistry related to photoconversion including ultrafast spectroscopy, molecular charge transfer, photoresponsive materials and photoconversion in chemical systems;  3) structure and function of photosynthetic reaction centers, synthetic model systems for the photosynthetic reaction center, artificial photosynthesis; and  4) molecular regulation of photosynthesis and genetic engineering of photosynthetic efficiency. \r\n\r\nThe areas of physics, chemistry and biology being discussed are relevant to many current global problems.  These include the need for development of energy efficient economies and alternative (i.e., non-fossil fuel) energy sources, global warming and advanced agricultural technology.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger scientists.  The proceedings of the meeting are expected to be made available by the organizers on a specially constructed web-site that will be announced in appropriate newsletters (e.g., \"The Inter-American Photochemical Society Newsletter,\" \"The Spectrum,\" and \"Japan Photochemical Society Newsletter\").  They will further establish links to the site at established chemistry and photoscience related web sites. \r\n***\r\n",
