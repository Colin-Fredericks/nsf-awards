At birth, most individuals are males.  This is especially true among first offspring.  Physiological variables including body temperature and hormone fluctuations across the estrous cycle may influence the birth male to female ratio.  These depend on a behavioral mediator.  The male, the female, or both, must be more willing to mate at a point in the cycle coincident with the physiological parameters that influence the gender of the resulting offspring.  As the time between insemination and ovulation increases, the probability that the fetus will be male also increases.  Because female bushbabies have a 2-10 day receptive period, there is an opportunity for variation in the time between insemination and ovulation.  The increased male bias in first offspring could result from differences in the timing of insemination.  Males may control mating with younger, inexperienced females but may have less influence with older, experienced females.  Dr. Watson's research will use evaluation of videotaped courtship behavior to document differences between inexperienced and experienced females.  This will examine the hypothesis that control of the timing of insemination by males and females influences the gender of the fetus.\r\n\r\nThe results provide information about the influence of social behaviors on birth male to female ratios.  This knowledge will benefit captive breeding programs for primitive primates.  It may add to the understanding of human reproduction.  This project will initiate the first nonhuman primate colony at a historically black university, enabling greater research opportunities for minority students. \r\n",
