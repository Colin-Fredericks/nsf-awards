This postdoctoral starter grant will clarify the currently undetermined biological significance of the shift by rigorously and systematically comparing empirically observed food web patterns with patterns generated by null and mechanistic models. As a rich history in ecology has shown, such comparisons are critical to evaluating the claim that robust food web patterns are indicative of powerful biological processes that constrain the structure and function of ecological systems. Lacking the comparisons, the hypothesis that food web patterns are methodological artifacts needs to be systematically studied before much work on the biological basis for the patterns is warranted. The relatively small amount of previous work comparing natural and null food webs suggests that biological processes are responsible for the relatively low value of connectance in a wide range of terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecological systems. In an attempt to delineate the processes responsible for this and other food web patterns, candidate biological mechanisms will be formalized into computer models that construct food webs. Webs constructed in this manner will be compared against empirically observed food webs. This comparison will indicate whether the simulated mechanisms deserve further analytical and experimental investigation as potential sources of food web patterns.\r\n",
