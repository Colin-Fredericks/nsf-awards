The researchers will be undertaking a study of  phylogeny of brain/pituitary hormones of agnathans.  The goal is to develop new techniques and insight on the molecular isolation of pituitary hormones (in particular, gonadotropins, GTH) in lampreys and hagfish.  Lampreys of the class agnathans are of particular importance in understanding endocrinological relationships since they represent one of the oldest lineages of extant  vertebrates which evolved over 550 million years ago.  In this project, agnathans are considered to be paraphyletic in origin with the modern agnathans classified into two groups, myxinoids (hagfish) and petromyzonids (lamprey).  The gonadotropins, prolactin or growth hormones have not yet been identified in lampreys and no anterior pituitary hormones have been identified in hagfish.    \r\n\r\nThis project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. researchers' expertise is in the area of neuroendocrinology and the Japanese have expertise in biochemistry. Results of this research should provide further information for the evolution of the hormones, prediction of gene duplication during the early development of vertebrates and also provide information that may help in resolving the phylogenetic relationships between hagfish, lampreys and jawed vertebrates. This research advances international human resources through the participation of a younger scientist.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.\r\n***\r\n",
