 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Stephen Savage will obtain radiocarbon dates on approximately one hundred organic samples from a Predynastic Egyptian cemetery, N7000 located at Naga-ed-Der in Upper Egypt. Excavated in the early part of this century, the materials are curated at the Hearst Museum at the University of California, Berkeley, and cover the time range from ca. 2,700 to 2,100 B.C. The cemetery contains 635 graves and ca. 900 burials as well as numerous grave goods including ceramics, woven clothing and food offerings. Samples will be dated at the University of Arizona AMS laboratory and thus only small amounts of material will be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Predynastic prehistory of Egypt is important for understanding the rise of the Egyptian empires and social complexity in general, it is surprisingly poorly dated. Traditional methods are based not on an absolute chronology anchored with radiocarbon but rather on relative seriation of ceramic styles. Gravelots from cemeteries in this region were originally seriated in the early part of the 20th century. It was assumed that graves with the most similar ceramics were most closely associated in time and through a comparison of the degree of similarity a sequence was constructed. Over wide portions of the Near East the Upper Egyptian sequence is used to date geographically dispersed sites and thus its impact is very broad. However the original and subsequent seriations have been questioned and it is important to place these ceramic styles securely in time. To understand change, archaeologists must anchor sites both absolutely and relative to each other. Dr. Savage's research will help to achieve this for a very important time period and region of the world. The results will be widely used.\r\n",
