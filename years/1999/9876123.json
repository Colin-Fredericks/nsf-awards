This tool will be a virtual environment.  A user\r\nwill be able to see and fly through a large structure.  The user will,\r\nalso, be able to touch the structure, to feel its resistance, and to\r\npush on it. To do this, I intend to merge a haptic interface tool into\r\nan augmented reality setting.\r\n\r\nMy objectives for the next four years are:\r\n\r\n1. To make a virtual environment for modeling three-dimensional\r\nframe structures using VRML and interface it to DRAIN-3DX, a\r\nprogram for structural analysis of civil structures.\r\n\r\n2. To incorporate a haptic interface in this virtual environment\r\nand develop a haptic rendering methodology for large structure,\r\nenabling the user to push the structure and feel its deformation.\r\n\r\n3. To interface the virtual modeling environment and the\r\nreal laboratory environment by making it possible to address\r\nvirtual and real sub-structures through the same interface. \r\n\r\nDevelopment of a haptic structural modeling tool is a challenge.\r\nHaptic rendering of large objects is an open problem. Design of a\r\nhaptic interface to virtual and real substructures has not been done\r\nbefore, but may have a broader significance for a Network for\r\nEarthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), a five-year NSF initiative\r\ntaking off in 1999.\r\n\r\nThe challenges are here, but the benefits of having a haptic learning\r\ntool are huge! Students will be able to touch structures, resist land\r\nslides, feel earthquake vibrations and immerse in fluid flow. This\r\nhaptic tool will take learning from hearing and seeing to touching and\r\ndoing... and understanding, as Lao Tsu meant two-and-a-half millenia\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--",
