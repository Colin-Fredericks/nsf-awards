In addition to improved reliability, the equipment includes digital filtering, high speed phase shifting, extreme digitization rates and offers significantly enhanced sensitivity and flexibility in experimental design and setup. The increased sensitivity will enable new\r\nexperiments, especially those that require rapid data acquisition or very small sample volumes.\r\nThe improved user interface translates into greater productivity, especially in an educational\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nUCLA has an outstanding track record integrating basic research with innovative undergraduate programs to enhance the educational experience of students and has been very successful in recruiting minority students to participate in research training.  The equipment will be fully utilized in the training of students.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is an ideal equipment acquisition.  It will be employed to enhance the research and training experience of students.\r\n",
