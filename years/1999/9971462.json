Napier\r\n\r\n\r\nA complex manifold X is said to be holomorphically convex if, for\r\nevery infinite subset S without limit points in X, there is a\r\nholomorphic function f on X which is unbounded on S.  The\r\nprincipal investigator plans to work on holomorphic convexity\r\nproperties of coverings of projective varieties.  He also plans\r\nto work on problems concerning Lefschetz type theorems and the\r\nstructure of complete Kahler manifolds which have been partly\r\nmotivated by the study of covering spaces.  He proposes to apply\r\nrecent advances in the theory of singular metrics to these\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nHolomorphic functions on regions in the complex number plane (or\r\non more general complex spaces) are the natural analogues of\r\ndifferentiable functions on the real number line from\r\ndifferential calculus.  A very broad, deep, and old problem is to\r\ndetermine how the geometric structure of a (complex) space is\r\nrelated to its holomorphic structure.  This question has\r\nmotivated a large amount of work in mathematics and has itself\r\nbeen motivated by work in many fields (for example, physics).\r\nKahler manifolds are spaces in which the (infinitesimal)\r\nholomorphic structure is connected with the (infinitesimal)\r\ngeometric structure in a natural way.  Holomorphic convexity is\r\nan analogue of geometric convexity (for example, a region in the\r\nplane is geometrically convex if any line segment connecting two\r\npoints in the region lies entirely within the region).  It has\r\nbeen known for forty years that, for a noncompact complex\r\nmanifold, holomorphic convexity is a strong condition which tells\r\none a great deal about the holomorphic structure.  Thus a natural\r\nquestion in the context of the broader problem mentioned above is\r\nwhen is a Kahler manifold holomorphically convex?\r\n",
