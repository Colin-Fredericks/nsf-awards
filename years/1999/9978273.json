High temperature superconductivity has posed an unparalleled challenge to scientists and has offered great promise to technologists. In spite of the impressive progress made in high temperature superconductivity science and technology in the last 13 years, a comprehensive microscopic theory is yet to be developed and viable commercialization remains beyond reach. The Conference will bring together members of the international superconductivity community to focus on insights into the physics, materials and devices of superconductors, with a projection to the emerging and future research areas in superconductivity and related science and devices. All major superconductivity and related topics will be covered. The Conference is the largest international event on super-conductivity and is held every two to three years. Ample time will be made available for close interaction between participants, and between veteran and young researchers, in particular. It is strongly believed that cross-fertilization between various subdomains of superconductivity and related research resulting from the close interaction among participants at the Conference will accelerate the development of superconductivity science and technology.\r\n%%%\r\nThe support provided by this project will enhance the opportunity for graduate students and young scientists to attend the Sixth International Conference on Materials and Mechanisms of Superconductivity-High Temperature Superconductors to be held, February 20-25, 2000, in Houston, Texas. The Conference is the largest international event on superconductivity held every two-three years with the expected attendance of about 1500 for this coming event. High temperature superconductivity has been proposed by some to be one of the critical technologies of the 21st century. The training of young researchers in this area is very important to maintaining the US in a prominent position in the future development of high temperature superconductivity science and technology.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
