 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proof of concept project demonstrates that one can develop a research based, problem-solving guidebook for students in a calculus based introductory physics course that is acceptable to faculty teaching the course. The project  builds on the existing research on the differences between expert and novice problem solving.  To accomplish our goal to develop a prototype of educational materials for students,  we incorporate information relating to: (1) the beliefs of a sample of faculty about student problem solving and (2) the difficulty students have solving problems posed by the faculty on examinations.  The entire project is under the guidance of part of the University of Minnesota Physics Education Group with the collaboration of University of Minnesota faculty members in physics.   Building on our extensive work with cooperative group problem solving pedagogy, the project outcomes are: (1) a prototype student problem solving guidebook for the mechanics component of an introductory calculus based physics course; (2) a plan for the complete development of a comprehensive problem solving guidebook for students and an accompanying faculty guide, tested at diverse sites and revised.  The prototype student problem solving guide is available through McGraw-Hill either from our web site (http://www.physics.umn.edu/groups/physed/) , in our workshops, or directly from the publisher.\r\n",
