Sperling/Lehigh U.\r\n\r\nThe objective of  this proposal is to study the diffusion and equilibrium concentration of different molecular weight polymer chains near interfaces, particularly filler or reinforcing particulate interfaces, polymer blend interfaces, and free surfaces.  The diffusion experiments will emphasize times shorter than the reputation time, the range of greatest industrial importance.  A series of experiments are planned to study the kinetics of diffusion of polymers to surfaces and interfaces, and also to establish experimentally the conditions under which shorter or longer chains are attracted preferentially to such surfaces.  The basis will be the use of deuterated probe polymers of longer shorter molecular weights, to establish not only the diffusion rates towards the surfaces and interfaces involved, but also the equilibrium concentrations.  The polymers involved will be based on polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate), with silica serving as one of the composite fillers.  Another series of experiments will involve blends of ionic and non-ionic polymers.  The ionic polymer portion will be deuterated.  By studying the effective molecular weights and radii of gyration of the chains, as well as their effective diffusion rates, the relationships between the size of the ionic groups and/or aggregation effects can be determined.  Yet another set of experiments will measure the direct chemical reaction between the ends of chains, important as an alternate to interdiffusion in latex film formation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
