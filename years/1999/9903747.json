 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate and develop concepts and methods for reliability analysis of power networks.  The emphasis is both on system and nodal reliability.  The terms node and area are used interchangeably in this proposal to represent a single major load or generation injection point or a collection. of such points.  The research conducted under the previous NSF support has led to several insights.  The proposed research is based on these insights as well as new concepts for investigation.  Following will be the major thrusts of this investigation.\r\n\r\nSeveral properties of the multi-node power networks have been identified.  These properties of the multi-node power systems will be rigorously proven and used to improve the existing algorithms as well as develop more efficient methods of reliability analysis of power systems.  \r\n\r\nThe basic idea of boundary point method has been proposed on these properties.  This ideal will be investigated to find means to make it a computationally efficient method.\r\n\r\nThree concepts have been proposed for developing more efficient methods of multi-node reliability analysis.  These concepts have been identified based on the insights that we have obtained during our previous investigation .  These concepts will be explored in detail and more techniques will be developed.  \r\n\r\nOften there is an area of interest for investigation and one would like to obtain reliability of this area\r\nefficiently.  A method is proposed for determining the reliability of a node of interest without analyzing the whole system.  This method will be explored, implemented and tested.  \r\n\r\nThe self-organizing maps (SOM) provide the capability to compress data and extract relationships.  The SOM concept will be investigated for multi-node reliability evaluation.  It appears that combination of SOM and Monte Carlo Simulation could result in a new way of analyzing the reliability of power networks.  \r\n\r\nPower systems are capacitated networks.  The developed techniques will also be investigated for applications to other capacitated networks such as telecommunication, gas-flow and water-flow networks.     \r\n",
