 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nRecently, considerable interest has begun to focus on \r\nspatial data problems.  The statistician finds an exciting\r\nopportunity to expand the current analytical repertoire, \r\nwhich is dominated by descriptive summary and ad hoc inference\r\nprocedures.  Bringing formal stochastic modeling and the \r\nresultant full inference which becomes available, to the \r\nanalysis of spatial data becomes attractive.   Fully model-based\r\napproaches offer challenges both in supplying a sufficiently\r\nflexible framework and fitting models within such a framework.\r\nThe proposed research considers three such challenging problems.\r\nThey are (i) the handling of misaligned data layers which arises\r\nwhen there is interest in relating variables which are collected\r\nfrom different sources and these sources use different areal\r\npartitions of a region, (ii) the handling of bivariate (and, more\r\ngenerally, multivariate) spatial processes arising for the\r\nobserved data or as latent (second stage) processes in a \r\nhierarchical model, and (iii) the handling of large spatial\r\ndatasets within the so-called \"geostatistical\" perspective\r\nwhich, using first or second stage Gaussian specifications,\r\npresents a likelihood whose evaluation requires high-dimensional \r\nmatrix inversion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpatial data arises in many fields of application.  For instance,\r\nin ecology and evolutionary biology, investigation of the process\r\nof deforestation is an important area.  Such a process inherently\r\nexhibits spatial pattern which evolves over time and hence connects \r\nto federal strategic interest in environmental and global change\r\n(EGCH).  It is of interest to use socioeconomic information in\r\naddition to physical features of the land area to understand this\r\nprocess.  In financial/real estate applications it is of interest\r\nto index residential propery values.  The familiar maxim, \"location,\r\nlocation, location\" anticipates spatial association in housing prices.\r\nIn epidemiology one seeks to identify spatial patterns/clustering of\r\ndisease incidence in order to assess areas of high risk.  Incidence\r\nrates have to be adjusted to reflect differences in population\r\nsize and exposure to risk factors.  In all of these applications \r\nsimple descriptive summary of the collected data will not be adequate.  \r\nRather, one needs to make inference, e.g., to assess which factors \r\nexplain the deforestation, to predict the price of a home when it \r\ngoes on the market, to conclude that a particular area is at a \r\nsignificantly higher risk for a particular disease.  The research  \r\nunder this grant support proposes the use of probabilistic modeling \r\nto address these questions.  Appropriate specification of, fitting \r\nof and drawing inference under such models are the objectives.\r\n",
