 "awd_abstract_narration": "A team of faculty from the departments of Political Science, International Relations, and Urban Studies (PSIRUS), working through the PSIRUS Center, is adapting and extending existing innovative practices in computer-mediated instruction, incorporating recently published research and available databases in the social sciences.  The project team is producing four thematic modules, each designed to reach both majors and non-majors in the social sciences, and structured to work for a diverse student body that includes working students, minority students, older re-entry students, and students with special learning needs.  \r\n\r\nThe modules are:\r\n1. The Media and Politics. This module is modeled on innovative practices at the Wexler Learning Center at the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. The proposed  \"virtual learning center\" will teach students to integrate a variety of audio and video materials into undergraduate research projects examining the effect of the media in shaping public opinion, and the relationships between media, public opinion, and politics.  The content of this module will be adapted from Richard Davis, \"Politics and the Media,\" (Prentice Hall, 1992) and Lawrence Grossman, \"The Electronic Republic: Reshaping Democracy in the Information Age,\" (Viking Press, 1995).  \r\n\r\n2. Urban Sustainable Development.  This module is adapting use of on-line forms to capture data.  It is employing modern computer techniques to transfer the data into electronic databases for analysis using statistics software.  (Amazon.com and other private sector e-commerce organizations are using this methodology effectively.) Its purpose is to develop an understanding of the relationship between urbanization and the natural and \"built\" environment, and to support undergraduate research on \"sustainable development.\"  The module is being constructed from materials found in Marcia Lowe, \"Shaping Cities: The Environmental and Human Dimensions,\" (World Watch Institute, Paper 105, 1992);  Graham Haughton and Colin Hunter, \"Sustainable Cities,\" (London: Regional Studies Association, 1994);  the President's Council on Sustainable Development, \"Sustainable America,\"  (U.S. GPO, 1996); and Sim Van de Ryn and Stuart Cowan, \"Ecological Design,\" (Island Press, 1995).\r\n\r\n3. Immigration.  This module is taking advantage of the revolutionary changes occurring in the availability and accessibility of immigration data, which are increasingly available on-line.  It is teaching students about data analysis and building on practices developed by the California State University Social Science Research and Instructional Council (SSRIC) and other organizations which have created on-line, public domain, social science data archives.  \r\nIts purpose is to help students sort out truth from assertion, and how to formulate reasoned political responses.  It is particularly based on Michael Fix and Jeffrey Passel, \"Immigration and Immigrants: Setting the Record Straight, (Urban Institute, 1994);  Sanford Ungar, \"Fresh Blood: The New American Immigrants,\"  (Simon & Schuster, 1995);  Gregory DeFre, \"Immigration, Inequality, and Policy Alternatives,\" (Russell Sage Foundation, 1995);  and U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, \"Statistical Yearbook of the INS,\" (U.S. GPO, 1995).  \r\n \r\n4. Global Conflict.   This module is developing a novel use of Prolog - a logic language - to teach about both values and critical thinking in relation to global conflict.  Students are learning to gather data and test theories about causes of global conflict, following Paul Viotti and Mark Kauppi, \"International Relations Theory,\" (MacMillan, 1993).  This module is also using existing databases such as the Correlates of War data managed by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (Correlates of War Database 9905, 1994).  \r\n\r\n",
