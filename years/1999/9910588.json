 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project evaluates the Conceptual Learning of Engineering (CoLoE) concept and addresses its possible implementation in classroom teaching at universities and community colleges across the US.  The idea is based on conceptual rather than mathematical teaching and learning of engineering courses.  The procedure involves the application of the fundamental laws of nature to a larger number of individual molecules, atoms, and electrons, and the observation of their collective behavior under a variety of external forces and operating conditions.  Mathematical equations are derived as a result of observing changes in these interactions as a function of time and space.\r\n\r\nFaculty workshops are used to evaluate the educational merits of the CoLoE concept.  Colleagues from CoLoS Europe demonstrate their software modules, and the colleagues from schools of education in the US also present their own evaluations and discuss methods for improvements.  Breakout groups discuss ways and means for integrating CoLoS material in courses and classroom teaching, and also identify focused engineering subjects that will benefit most from this teaching methodology.  Groups of institutions from universities and community colleges are identified and asked to prepare proposals in their respective areas.\r\n\r\nIn support of the workshops, the PI and his colleagues at the University of Utah are developing software modules that emphasis conceptual and intuitive understanding of basic engineering courses.  For this proposal, focus is placed on electromagnetics and the properties of matter.  The project is managed by the CAEME Center for Multimedia Education and Technology at the University of Utah, and dissemination is via the Internet, CD-ROMs and publications in journals.",
