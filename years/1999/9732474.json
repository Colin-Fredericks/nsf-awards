This program will allow six students and two faculty members, who do not currently have access to the Keck Consortium research program, to participate in any of six projects, any associated workshops, and to present their results at the annual Keck Research Symposium in Geology.  Each student will have a sponsor at their home institution who will supervise research during the academic year.  These sponsors may visit the summer research sight and participate in the research symposium.  Students and faculty will be recruited nationally from all types of institutions, particularly those that do not have established undergraduate research programs.  This program will provide research opportunities for students in a highly successful program and a faculty enrichment experience that combines research and education.  Both students and faculty will benefit from becoming part of a community that supports undergraduate research.\r\n",
