This \r\nconference is designed to provide a forum for experts in asymptotics,\r\nclassical special functions, combinatorics, harmonic analysis, quantum\r\ngroups, mathematical physics, differential equations, and orthogonal \r\npolynomials to exchange ideas and to acquaint participants with the \r\nmost recent developments in these areas. The goal of recent work in \r\nasymptotics is to derive expansions whose error terms are exponentially\r\nsmall. Such expansions give much greater accuracy than the classical \r\nPoincare' type expansions and have larger regions of validity. The \r\nharmonic analysis aspects of special functions involve root systems \r\nand representations of quantum and classical matrix groups. In the \r\nlast few years, such methods have been used to find new results about\r\nspecial functions (both standard and q-type) of several variables.  \r\nFor example, these methods were used to prove conjectures of Macdonald \r\nthat came from an algebraic combinatorics setting and to construct \r\nexact solutions of quantum many-body systems of Calogero-Moser-\r\nSutherland type.\r\n \r\nSpecial functions form a large family of functions of fundamental \r\nimportance in Mathematics. For instance, they appear in the modelling \r\nof any physical phenomena where there is some degree of symmetry, as in\r\nthe vibrations of a circular drum. The conference program includes invited\r\none-hour plenary lectures, several parallel sessions of half-hour presentations, and round-table discussions of outstanding problems and future research directions.  \r\nApproximately eighty participants are expected. Researchers from many \r\ncountries will be invited as speakers including relatively large \r\ndelegations from the U.S., Canada, Netherlands, Japan, and Australia.  \r\nThis international workshop will facilitate discussions between applied \r\nmathematicians and more theoretical researchers so that applied problems \r\namenable to solutions via special functions can be identified and the \r\nnew mathematical tools can be utilized in applications. The conference \r\nwill be held  in cooperation with the Society for Industrial and Applied \r\nMathematics (SIAM) including SIAM's Activity Group on Orthogonal \r\nPolynomials and Special Functions and the newly chartered South East \r\nAsia Section.\r\n",
