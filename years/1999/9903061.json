Since 1992, the Megascience Forum of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has provided a venue where decision makers from more than 20 countries can engage in timely discussion and consultation on possibilities for international cooperation in large-scale research programs and projects.  This grant will constitute a portion of the US contribution to the work of the Megascience Forum.  It will enable NSF program managers in several fields, including materials science, nuclear physics, biological information, and radio astronomy, to continue consultations with their counterparts from other countries about the effective and efficient development of facilities in their disciplines.  Several other agencies, including the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health, are also making contributions to the continued work of the Forum.  \r\n",
