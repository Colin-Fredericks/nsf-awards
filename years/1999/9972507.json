The focus of the research is the theoretical study of magnetic microwave envelope soliton propagation in magnetic thin films.  In general, a soliton occurs in a nonliner system as a result of a balance of dispersive effects, which tends to broaden a pulse, and the narrowing effects from nonlinearities.  Solitons have been produced in both optical fibers and in magnetic thin films, and they have potential applications in the fields of information processing and communications systems owing to their ability to propagate large distances without changing shape.  In the laboratory magnetic microwave envelope solitons can be produced from an initial rectangular input pulse, which changes shape as it propagates until the soliton forms.  The fully formed soliton has been modeled by the nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation, but recent experimental results indicate that this may not be an adequate model.  For this reason, this project will study a model of soliton formation and propagation when higher order terms are included in the NLS equation, which has explained experimental data not accounted for by the standard NLS theory.  Additional exact solutions of the higher order NLS equations will be obtained and these will be used to develop a theory of soliton formation in thin films.  Experimentally it can be observed how far the pulse must propagate until it developes into a soliton.  Both analytical and numerical techniques will be used to determine this propagation distance in terms of parameters in the higher order NLS model.  Dissipation from spin wave damping is an important effect in magnetic thin films that cannot be neglected.  Therefore, the effect of dissipation on the propagation of the exact solutions will be considered.  This part of the research will also include higher order dissipative terms.    \r\nRecently, magnetic microwave envelope solitons have been amplified in a region of localized parallel pumping.  A nonlinear theory of soliton amplification and formation by localized pumping will be developed. \r\n\r\nThis is a grant under the Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.  It also involves an international collaboration with the Ukraine.  The focus of the research is the theoretical study of magnetic microwave envelope soliton propagation in magnetic thin films.  Besides addressing a fundamental issue in nonlinear physics, the project may find applications in information processing and communications.\r\n\r\n",
