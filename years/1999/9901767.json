 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a high-pressure metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system to minimize the toxic waste generated during growth of III-V phosphides.  Spire will demonstrate this technology with its InP space solar cell process.  A reduction in use of phosphine by more than one order of magnitude is predicted.  This technology will benefit the environment by minimizing phosphorus waste generated by MOCVD production of optoelectronic devices, and will benefit manufacturers of such devices by improving safety and reducing manufacturing costs associated with the use of phosphine. Phase I aimed at the improvement of the materials quality of GaN-based compounds and developed and successfully operated a high-pressure MOCVD system.   In previous work, Spire developed a high-pressure MOCVD system for InP growth; we successfully demonstrated InP films with excellent surface morphology at a V/Ill ratio of 1: 1, thereby drastically reducing the use of phosphine.  In Phase II,  an improved high-pressure MOCVD system will be designed and built.  The growth parameters will be  optimized to achieve device quality InP layers and fabricate InP solar cells to demonstrate a device application.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of phosphine usage for MOCVD growth of space solar cells promises significant savings in cost for phosphine and for waste disposal.  Once a commercial high-pressure MOCVD system is available, there will be  a demand for this technology in other areas, such as growth of GaInP-AlGainP redlight emitting diodes (LEDs) and GaN-based LEDs and lasers.\r\n",
