 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861136\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate a novel approach to biooxidize refractory chalcopyrite ore concentrates.   Chalcopyrite is a sulfidic copper ore which has a negative environmental impact upon smelting due to SO2 production, but which has proven difficult to process by approaches such as biooxidation.The proposed work will evaluate leach rates from a chalcopyrite ore concentrate in a novel integrated bioleaching system.  . The dissolution of chalcopyrite should be greatly accelerated due to system electrochemistry, favorable thermodynamics at elevated temperature, the presence of microbial Fe (II) and sulfur oxidizers, and control of particular operational parameters.  Analytical techniques such as ESCA and SEM/EDX will be used to monitor reactions on pyrite and chalcopyrite surfaces.  Metal solubilization will be monitored by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP).  The research objectives of this project are to verify the acceleration of copper leach rates and to demonstrate thermodynamic and electrochemical control of surface reactions under a defined set of system parameters.  This investigation, if successful, would directly result in the development of a new process for utilizing reserves of refractory chalcopyrite ores.\r\n     The potential market is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  The technology could easily be integrated to scale with current mining practices and will substantially reduce the dependence of the mining industry on smelting.\r\n",
