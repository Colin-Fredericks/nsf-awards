 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to  identify the major cost drivers associated with the use of advanced composite materials in full scale production rotorcraft structures.  the investigation will involve consulting with various rotorcraft industry and government personnel to identify general and specific problems inherent with the use of advanced composite materials.  Selection of potential research areas aimed at reducing the costs associated with the design/analysis/manufacturing processes will be performed. The viability of the application of structural optimization procedures in such will be considered.  The support from a POWRE award will enable the investigator, after a major career hiatus, to take advantage of a unique opportunity to re-establish industry linkages while establishing a research area in the analysis and design of advanced composite rotorcraft structures aided by structural optimization techniques.  It is expected that both educational and research opportunities will be enhanced by this activity.",
