 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund a conference entitled \"Symbolic Computation, Number Theory, Special Functions, Physics and Combinatorics.\" Computer Algebra (or symbolic computation) is an interdisciplinary area between Mathematics and Computer Science.  Its research focuses on the development of algorithms for performing symbolic manipulations of algebraic objects on computers, and the design of programming languages and environments for implementing these algorithms. \r\n\r\nThis conference will focus on the symbolic computation side of computer algebra. There are two main aspects: (1) devising algorithms for the symbolic computation of objects from Number theory, Special Functions, Physics and Combinatorics; and (2) applying these algorithms to discover and/or prove results in these areas. The main emphasis of the conference will be Computer Algebra and how it relates to the fields of Number Theory, Special Functions, Physics and Combinatorics. A subject that is common to all of these fields is q-series. We hope to bring together those who do symbolic computation with q-series and those that need q-series including workers in Physics and Combinatorics. The conference should inform mathematicians and physicists that use q-series of the latest developments in the field and especially how symbolic computation has aided these developments. It should also inform participants of new computer algebra software and algorithms used in the study of q-series.",
