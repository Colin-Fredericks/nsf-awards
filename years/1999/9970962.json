The objective is to study the behavior of quantum-confined carriers in semiconductor nanostructures that are strongly driven by intense THz laser radiation.  The focus of the research is to explore strong light-matter interactions in non-perturbative regimes that are inaccessible in atomic spectroscopy. Such research provides new insight into the complicated dynamics of many-body systems, but equally important, it is useful for developing novel semiconductor devices that operate in the technologically little explored THz frequency range (0.1 -10 THz).  Particular attention will be placed on how we can control such dynamics by \"dressing\" the quantum-confined states with strong THz oscillating fields.  Because of the rarity of sources for intense, coherent, and tunable THz radiation, research in this direction has not been well explored.  The experiments will be performed using the Stanford Free-Electron Laser, which has been recently extended to this frequency regime.\r\n%%%\r\nThis project deals with the non-equilibrium dynamics of carriers in semiconductors.  The main emphasis is in probing many-body effects in quantum-confined systems in strong magnetic fields using terahertz/far-infrared spectroscopic techniques.  Such research provides insight into the fundamental physics of correlated confined carriers, but equally important, it is useful for developing novel semiconductor devices that operate in the terahertz (THz) frequency range.  This frequency range, lying between electronic (< 100 GHz) and photonic (> 10 THz) frequencies, is scientifically rich but technologically poor.\r\n***\r\n",
