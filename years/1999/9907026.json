 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many important questions confront those who seek to do research on the patterns and processes associated with land-use and land-cover change in different parts of the world.  Among those questions are:  Do different institutions that use and manage resources produce different landscape-level patterns of land-use and land-cover change, and do these different patterns have different consequences on ecosystems and natural communities?  This doctoral dissertation research project examines the evolution of landscape-scale forest-cover patterns in the southern Yucatan peninsular region of Mexico, paying special attention to how forest cover is affected by distinct social institutions promoting forest conservation.  The primary research questions ask whether distinct conservation institutions give rise to different landscape-level patterns, and whether diverse landscape-level patterns reflect different ecosystem and community-level consequences.  Interviews with and surveys of leaders of key conservation institutions will elicit information about conservation strategies and implementation plans.  Programs creating incentives and disincentives for local land-users, particularly smallholder farmers, will be investigated.  Qualitative and quantitative data will be gathered on subsidization of smallholder activities that maintain forest cover, and on explicit mechanisms controlling the area, spatial pattern and timing of deforestation.  Spatial extents of control exercised by the key institutions will be mapped, digitized, and analyzed to assess their statistical relationship to current landscape pattern indices and to changes in patterns over the last 15 years.  Pattern indices such as forest fragmentation and connectivity will be computed from a remote-sensing-derived land-use and land-cover classification.  The landscape study will then be grounded in point assessments of local successional forests for ecosystem function attributes (carbon and nitrogen stocks, soil moisture and relative biomass) and community composition (species and structural diversity).  This study will incorporate methods of landscape and community ecology with spatially explicit geographic research to study the role of local conservation institutions of the southern Yucatan region in changing landscape patterns, ecosystem functions, and biodiversity.  The project will shed new light on the ecological and institutional dynamics of land-use and land-cover change and on temporal and spatial scalar issues in linking local and landscape-level studies of land-use patterns and processes.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.",
