 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Patricia Gilman, MS Valli Powell will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. The focus of her study is the prehistoric Mimbres people of the Mogollon region of southwestern New Mexico. During the 900s A.D. the inhabitants of the Mimbres valley were small scale farmers who supplemented agriculture with wild plants and hunted game. By the A.D. 1000s subsistence was based on full-time farming which included new agricultural technologies such as irrigation and check dams. Paleoclimaatic data indicate that the period from 1,000 to ca. 1089 A.D. was an unusually favorable time in both amount and consistency of precipitation and under these conditions population increased and all available arable land in the valley was cultivated. However in the following century rainfall fluctuated considerably in both amount and consistency and this led to increasing subsistence stress. Given this well established environmental record, MS Powell wishes to examine changing Mimbres social strategies. Preliminary work indicates that individual villages entered into alliances which changed in direction and extent over time in order to buffer environmental unpredictability. To accomplish this goal she will study the Mimbres produced black and white ceramics which have been recovered by carefully controlled excavation. Working on the assumption that shared design elements are both conscious and unconscious indicators of alliance, she is currently conducting an analysis of stylistic similarities among sites. The results however do not distinguish between similarities due to imitation and those which result from the actual movement of ceramics and this distinction is important because it is hypothesized that trade in food served to buffer differential agricultural productivity. With NSF funding the Texas A&M University Center for Chemical Characterization and Analysis will perform instrumental neutron activation analysis on a series of 150 black and white sherds. Based on the chemical composition data provided it will be possible to determine the source areas in which the pottery was produced.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons. It will provide insight into how agriculturalists at a simple level of technology adapted to an unpredictable fluctuating semi-arid environment. It will produce data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in training a promising young scientist.\r\n",
