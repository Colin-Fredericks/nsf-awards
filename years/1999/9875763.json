 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875763  Schlautman  This is an award to support research on the process by which naturally-occurring and benign materials can be converted into efficient heterogeneous catalysts for use in processes to remove organic and inorganic contaminants from water, soils and sediments.  The efficacy of immobilizing biomimetic catalysts on natural mineral substrates will be investigated by conducting the immobilization process to produce catalysts, using the catalysts produced to destroy selected organic and inorganic target pollutants, adsorbing target pollutants to inactivated catalysts and finally determination of the long-term viability of the immobilized catalysts.The proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to the Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program which emphasizes combining discovery of new knowledge with inspired teaching and enthusiastic learning.  The research component of this project is expected to provide knowledge that can be applied in engineering design of processes and systems to decontaminate water, soil and sediments.  The educational component will provide undergraduate and graduate students with knowledge of the processes that occur when organic and inorganic pollutants are destroyed by biomimetic catalysts as a step toward coupling this process with oxidation reactions and development of even more efficient systems to decontaminate environmental media.  This project will also provide students with access to modern techniques for study of physical and chemical processes that are significant in environmental engineering practice and opportunity to observe their professional application in engineering design of treatment processes and systems.  ***",
