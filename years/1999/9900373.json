The program is designed to stimulate parents to become informed, active proponents for high quality and more universally available science, mathematics, and technology education for their children.  The SMART Parents project team would design and disseminate strategies to enable parents to support their children's science, mathematics, and technology education.\r\n\r\nInnovative materials and strategies will be developed that will actively engage over 6,000 parents/families over the thirty-eight (38) months duration of the project.  Almost 20,000 families will become involved in the leadership-training component of this project.  The initiative will assist parents in supporting their children's education in science, mathematics, and technology education.  Ultimately, the project will enhance parents' knowledge and understanding of Informal Science Education. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
