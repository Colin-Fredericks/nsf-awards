While the profession has devoted significant attention to the analysis of equilibrium within such models, we still do not know enough about when we can expect, and what type of, equilibrium to emerge. Early studies and simple intuition suggest that positive results are more likely to emerge when we deal with large games.  This project investigates two types of large games: ones where the number of repetitions is large, and ones where the number of participants and/or decision variables is large.  Under the assumption that the agents are rational, or approximately so, the following issues and their applications are investigated: (1) representation of beliefs, (2) the possibility of learning to play equilibrium, (3) decomposing large games, and (4) the role of private information in large games.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
