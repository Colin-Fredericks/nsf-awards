This type of research is\r\n\r\nfundamental to the understanding of many physical problems governed by\r\n\r\nPDEs. The PI's will continue the development of a class of very\r\n\r\npowerful techniques, namely the Method of Moving Planes, to the study\r\n\r\nof local asymptotic symmetry of singular solutions and a priori\r\n\r\nestimates of solutions. The PI will also continue the joint work with\r\n\r\nW. Chen on the geometric problem of finding a conformal metric with a\r\n\r\nprescribed Gaussian or scalar curvature. The PI is also involved\r\n\r\nin the study of certain parabolic systems arising form other branches\r\n\r\nof sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany aspects of natural phenomena are related to each other by the\r\n\r\nnatural laws governing them and very often these relations are\r\n\r\nmathematically described by differential equations. The study of these\r\n\r\nequations is very important in understanding the related phenomena.\r\n\r\nIt is often the case that to solve differential equations \r\n\r\ncomputationally with sufficient accuracy, the most effective and\r\n\r\neconomical way is to exploit the properties of solutions of the \r\n\r\nequations and then to develop algorithms in accordance}. Besides being\r\n\r\nvery useful in applied science, the study of various kinds of\r\n\r\nstructures and properties of solutions to various types of equations\r\n\r\ninvariably leads to new research endeavors.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
