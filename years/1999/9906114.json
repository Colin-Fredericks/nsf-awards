 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Women Working Technical (WomenTech) Project is being carried out by the Institute for Women in Trades, Technology & Science (IWITTS).  It aims to:  1) increase the recruitment and retention of women in SMET courses at three community college demonstration sites; 2) institutionalize gender equity strategies beyond the Project's life; and 3) illustrate to the community college system gender equity strategies that increase recruitment and retention of women in SMET courses.\r\n   WomenTech is utilizing a National Advisory Committee to advise on development and dissemination of strategies.  Each demo site has a Leadership Team, whose advice and influence will ensure long-term institutionalization of project strategies.  IWITTS will conduct training on recruitment and retention of women in SMET courses and for the colleges' industry partners on successfully receiving women.  Women in SMET courses around the country will connect with each other through the WomenTech web site.  IWITTS will disseminate successful strategies nationally -- through conference presentations and media coverage and by capitalizing on the advice and networks of Leadership Team and National Advisory Committee members.\r\n   By increasing the number of women in SMET courses at the community college level, WomenTech will open wide the doors of opportunity for women in well-paying SMET technician careers.\r\n",
