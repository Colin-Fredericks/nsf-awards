 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to SUNY-Binghamton, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, \" Satellite Communication Networks: New Curriculum Development,\" Dr. Victor A. Skormin, Principal Investigator.  Proliferation of satellite communication network technology has stimulated basic and applied research in the relevant areas and impacted the job market creating the demand for a large number of appropriately educated researchers and engineers.  These trends present to universities not only potential sources for research funding but also stimuli for the development of new curricula.  This project proposes a new electrical engineering curriculum-Satellite Communication Networks (SCN). The proposed curriculum will include four undergraduate and entry-level graduate courses, namely, Technology and Devices for Communications Satellites, Digital Satellite Communications, Control System Technology for Communication Satellites, and Optical Communications for Satellite Networks.  Students enrolled in this curriculum will develop a background that will include relevant satellite technology, electronics and electro-optics, communications, signal processing, computer engineering, knowledge of control technologies, devices for laser beam steering, pointing-acquisition-tracking of satellites, and application of global positioning systems.  In addition to theoretical concepts, the students will gain strong laboratory experience and exposure to  advanced technologies and devices and will be well prepared to operate in high technology industrial environments as members of engineering and research teams.",
