Researchers at Potchefstroom University have completed a substantial amount of applied research, which has involved the study of new reagents for the flotation separation of strategic minerals, including minerals containing the platinum-group metals.  Already this applied research is being supported by the Foundation for Research Development (FRD) in South Africa.  On the other hand, fundamental studies are lacking.  In this regard, a cooperative research program with the University of Utah is planned to establish the fundamental flotation chemistry associated with these new reagents.  The research group at the University of Utah has extensive experience in flotation chemistry, and as a part of the program a South African student, Ms. Ronel du Plessis, has already started graduate studies.  In addition to fundamental studies, ore samples from US industries will be examined to evaluate the new reagents, which should be an important activity to support South African industrial development.  The results of this research work will be useful for the development of new technology in the minerals industries for the recovery of platinum, copper, and other metals of strategic importance to both countries.  \r\n",
