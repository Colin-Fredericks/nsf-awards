 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dennis Clouthier of the University of Kentucky is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the electronic spectra and excited state dynamics of a variety of group IVA silicon- and germanium-containing reactive intermediates.  A variety of laser spectroscopic techniques will be employed to study reactive intermediates in the gas phase, generated using electron impact or pyrolysis and subsequent supersonic free jet expansion methods.  Wavelength resolved fluorescence and stimulated emission pumping spectra of monohalosilylenes, monohalogermylenes, silylidene, germylidene, and their deuterated analogs will be measured in order to obtain further knowledge of their ground state energy levels and molecular structures.  Intersystem crossing and internal conversion dynamics of silylidene and the germylidene will be examined by quantum beat spectroscopy.  Previously unknown electronic spectra of silicon and germanium methylidyne, silanone, thiosilanone, and germanium carbide will be searched for and studied.  The species chosen for study play a significant role in semiconductor growth processes, and are also of current interest in astrophysics.  A strong motivation for this work is the difference between silicon and germanium compound chemistry and that of their carbon-based analogs, and interest in detection and characterization of molecules involving multiple bonds to silicon and germanium.\r\n\r\nUnstable chemical compounds that contain silicon and germanium are believed to play a significant role in semiconductor growth processes, but few of these reactive molecules have actually been identified or characterized at this time.  Establishing sensitive methods for detecting and characterizing reactive intermediate molecules involved in chemical vapor deposition is important in order to develop predictive capabilities for the production of thin films and nanoparticles.  Outcomes from this effort are expected to provide useful information for semiconductor processing technologies. \r\n\r\n",
