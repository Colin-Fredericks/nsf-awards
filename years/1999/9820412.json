 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame will sponsor a NSF-REU Site for Undergraduate research during the summers of 1999 - 2001. The focal point of the project is the use of model Systems and basic research to study the cellular and molecular basis of disease. A nationwide search will be conducted for 13 sophomore or junior participants, 9 of who will be supported by the NSF and 4 by the Graduate School at the University of Notre Dame. The program will emphasize the recruitment of women, minority students, disabled students, and students from small colleges by soliciting applications from traditionally minority schools and from small colleges within approximately 300 miles of the Notre Dame campus. Participants will carry out research projects for 9 weeks. During these 9 weeks, they will speak on their proposed work at the beginning of the summer and will present their results at the end of the summer at the REU Summer Symposium. A weekly graduate student seminar program will be included to expose students to modern biological methods and to introduce students to research they might do in graduate school. In addition, students will participate in regular group meetings in their research labs and attend special workshops on career choices in the sciences, the value of basic research, ethics, problem solving, scientific writing, and team building. This program will give students experience in generating and analyzing their own research results as well as effectively reporting scientific information. It will also educate them on the important issues of professionalism; ethical conduct, collaboration, and other skills needed to succeed in the scientific arena. The underlying aim of the program is to give students strong incentives for pursuing careers in research.",
