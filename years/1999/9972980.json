Perhaps most importantly, it is the principle underlying most of the key diagnostic imaging modalities including x-ray Tomography (CT), PET and SPECT, certain forms of MRI, and emerging techniques such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and optical tomography.  Tomography is also the fundamental principle in numerous other problems and applications in science and engineering -- from electron microscopy of subcellular structures and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) in manufacturing, through geophysical exploration and environmental monitoring, to remote sensing by synthetic aperture radar (SAR).  The most widely used technique for solving the tomographic problem is known as Filtered Backprojection (FBP), and is ubiquitous in the realm of medical x-ray CT. But the FBP method is slow, and new technologies are making data acquisition possible at rates that cannot be handled by the FBP method and existing computer technology.  This research involves new ways of solving the tomography problem that use a very small fraction of the effort required by the FBP.\r\n\r\nThe investigator is studying a number of promising techniques for accelerating the FBP reconstruction algorithm.  He has discovered that the Radon transform can be factored in a special way, and that this new factorization leads to an O(N^2 log N) method (for reconstructing an N X N image from N projections) for solving the tomographic problems, as opposed to the FBP method, which is an O(N^3) method.  For large N, as are typically encountered in third or fourth generation x-ray CT systems, this represents a speedup of nearly two orders of magnitude.  This research also involves the use of this factorization to accelerate solutions to more complicated tomographic problems, in which data are missing or distorted.\r\n",
