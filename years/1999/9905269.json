 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe goal of this research is to understand the effects of strengthened racial cues in candidate evaluations.  As the racial cue of the candidate is strengthened with multiple indicators of race, voters evaluate the candidate differently from a candidate whose race is not reinforced or strengthened.  This research tests these effects regarding an African-American candidate.  The research determines if respondents evaluate candidates negatively or favorably as the race of the candidate becomes stronger or is reinforced with other racial indicators.  Furthermore, do voters make more stereotyped judgements as the racial cue is strengthened and is evaluation based more heavily on stereotypes and racial prejudice when the racial cue is strengthened?  Three indicators are used:  race (as indicated in a photo), ethnic first name, and membership in an organizatin whose members are predominatly black.  As more of these attributes are present for the candidate, the race of the candidate become stronger.  Respondents are asked to evaluate the cadndiate on a variety of policy questions and perceived candidate ideology, and to indicate their perceptions of African Americans.  This research also tests for differences in evaluation when respondents must infer the race of the candidate from the other racial indicators.",
