 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Notch cell communication pathway involves cell surface ligands, their \r\nreceptor, and a group of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins that transduce \r\nsignals from the cell surface to the nucleus.  The pathway is an essential \r\nregulator of neurogenesis and multiple other processes in Drosophila and \r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Drosophila mastermind (mam) gene encodes an essential \r\ncomponent of the Notch pathway.  The Mam protein is nuclear and very \r\nlikely functions in gene regulation.  However, attempts to demonstrate \r\nspecific DNA binding activity in vitro by Mam have been unsuccessful.  To \r\nbetter understand its function, current studies are directed at screening for \r\nloci that may encode a component of a transcription complex with Mam, \r\nand positioning Mam's role within the pathway.  Overexpression of \r\nengineered mutant versions of Mam in transgenic lines elicits an array of \r\ndominant phenotypes.  These phenotypes have been utilized in deficiency \r\nscreens for modifiers, and a number of genomic regions that enhance or \r\nsuppress have been identified.  The Mam mutations have also been used \r\nin epistasis experiments to position Mam function provisionally upstream \r\nof Delta-Notch signaling.  Such positioning has led to a new hypothesis \r\nthat Mam acts as a positive regulator of Delta transcription.  If this \r\nhypothesis is correct, Mam may play a key role in the activation of the \r\nNotch pathway, and a full characterization of its function should provide \r\nsubstantial insight into the regulation of this important signaling system.\r\n\r\nTo further characterize Mam three objectives are proposed:  1:  Continue \r\nan analysis of the effects of Mam truncations on embryonic neurogenesis \r\nand selected imaginal disc tissues; 2:  Complete the screening of the \r\ngenome for genetic modifiers and begin to identify potential loci that \r\nmediate the effects, and, 3:  Initiate cell culture transfection assays to test \r\nfor direct effects of Mam on Delta gene promotor activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
