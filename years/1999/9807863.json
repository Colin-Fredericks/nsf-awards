Along with this realization is the disturbing fact that man has over exploited shark populations to the extent that recovery of many populations is questionable.  Contrary to expectation, scientist have little data on how sharks feed, both from the perspective of how they capture their prey, but also in tems of the workings of their efficient feeding mechanisms.  With over 350 species in all the world's oceans, sharks provide one of the last unexplored frontiers in our understanding of predatory feeding behavior.  This study begins to unravel the mysteries of the shark feeding mechanism and their feeding behavior by thorough scientific analysis of prey capture in seven species of shark encompassing a diversity of feeding types.  Utilizing high speed video photography and electromyography, the monitoring of electrical signals from contracting jaw muscles, the PIs will investigate feeding in lemon, nurse, sand tiger, leopard, horn, bull, and sevengill sharks.  Together with work being conducted at other institutions, this study will lead to a better understanding of the evolution and functioning of shark feeding mechanisms and behaviors.",
