Consequently, the failure of dental restorations through reoccurring tooth decay, marginal discrepancies, and tooth fracture, are topics of substantial clinical significance.  The objective of the research is to show that cyclic fatigue crack growth in teeth is an important and largely unrecognized mechanism that contributes to dental restoration failure.   The hypothesis to be tested that that fatigue crack growth in teeth initiates at flaws introduced during cavity preparation with dental burs and is driven by cyclic mechanical and thermal loads which encompass standard oral activity.  The flaw propagates until reaching a critical crack length which enables the loss of biological tooth structure or bulk fracture of the restoration.   \r\n\r\nIn this study the cyclic crack growth rate in human dentin and the threshold crack length will be determined from an experimental analysis conducted with four-point-bend dentin specimens.  Fatigue specimens will be prepared from human teeth using a numerically controlled slicer/grinder.  A pre-fatigue crack will be introduced in each specimen, prior to zero-to-maximum four point bend fatigue loading, through the application of Mode I cyclic compression.  The cyclic flaw growth rate resulting from bend loading will be quantified in terms of the instantaneous crack length and maximum cyclic bend stress.  Using the cumulative fatigue crack growth data obtained from experimental analysis, the parameters describing cyclic fatigue crack growth according to the Paris Law will be determined.  Results from the experimental study will identify the significance of subsurface flaws introduced during cavity preparation on the  fatigue life of restored teeth.\r\n\r\n",
