 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic is well known as a unique scientific resource for biology\r\nbecause it contains exceptional records of past climatic fluctuations and\r\nthe concomitant interactions between biota and an extreme environment.\r\nPreliminary research has shown that the bones from animals from the\r\npermafrost contain a further important record of global change - a genetic\r\nrecord, detailing faunal evolution through the Late Pleistocene.\r\nPreliminary studies reveal that ancient DNA techniques and the polymerase\r\nchain reaction (PCR) can be used to recover, amplify, and sequence\r\nmitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of up to 600 base pairs (bp) in length from a\r\nvariety of permafrost specimens from extensive deposits near Dawson, Yukon\r\nTerritories and Fairbanks, Alaska. These permafrost deposits date from 20\r\nto 50 thousand years ago and contain thousands of bones from previous\r\ninhabitants of the area, making this resource a national treasure,\r\ncomprising the largest collection of Pleistocene genetic information in the\r\nworld. In addition to testing long-standing systematic issues, DNA from\r\nthese bones can be used to examine the consequences of past environmental\r\nchanges, such as the opening of the Bering land bridge, and climate and\r\nanthropogenic effects on population genetics.\r\n\r\nPermafrost DNA will be used to examine several questions concerning the\r\neffects of Late Pleistocene ecology on the genetics of modern populations,\r\nand how the effects of current environmental change and biological\r\nintroductions compare with that of the recent past. Mitochondrial control\r\nregion and cytochrome b DNA sequences of approximately 200-300 bp will be\r\nsequenced from about 20 specimens each of wolf (Canis lupus), moose (Alces\r\ngigas) and elk (Cervus elaphus) to examine how genetic diversity has\r\nchanged since the Late Pleistocene. All three taxa have fossil records of\r\nmore than several thousand years in North America, yet the genetic\r\ndiversity of modern North American populations is sufficiently limited that\r\nrecent bottlenecks appear to have occurred. These results will be\r\ncontrasted with those from analyses of the caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and\r\nthe brown bear (Ursus arctos), which also have a long record in North\r\nAmerica but have moderate amounts of genetic diversity in modern\r\npopulations, perhaps due to large population sizes throughout the Late\r\nPleistocene.\r\n\r\nAs well as examining changes in genetic diversity through time, the\r\npermafrost DNA will be used to assess the relationship of Late Pleistocene\r\npopulations to their modern counterparts. We will distinguish among four\r\npossible alternatives: 1) extant populations have DNA sequences that are\r\nphylogenetically distinct from those in the Old World and are directly\r\nrelated to those from Late Pleistocene North American predecessors. This\r\nresult implies genetic continuity and continental isolation throughout the\r\nLate Pleistocene and that modern populations survived recent glacial\r\nconditions and megafaunal extinction events in relative isolation; 2) DNA\r\nsequences of modern populations do not share a common ancestry with those\r\nin the permafrost implying that North American lineages went extinct\r\nsometime in the past 18,000 years and were replaced by those of an Old\r\nWorld ancestry existing in Beringia; 3) modern populations have a mixture\r\nof DNA haplotypes that are related to those from the Late Pleistocene of\r\nNorth America and the Old World implying recent admixture between Old and\r\nNew World populations; and 4) both modern and permafrost populations have a\r\nmixture of DNA haplotypes of Old and New World ancestry implying a history\r\nof continental mixing over the Late Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nAncient DNA research has promised to allow evolutionary change to\r\nbe observed through real time but has been constrained by the number of\r\nsamples and time frame that it has been possible to analyse. This project\r\nwill fulfil that potential since it permits genetic change to be recorded\r\nin two large, well sampled natural populations (Fairbanks and Dawson) over\r\na time frame of tens of thousands of years. It will also lead to a better\r\nunderstanding of the factors involved in molecular preservation under\r\npermafrost conditions, and suitable storage and handling regimes for\r\nspecimens uncovered by current mining operations. No organized collecting\r\nprogram currently exists for this valuable resource, and each year hundreds\r\nof specimens from this genetic museum are simply washed away downstream\r\n",
