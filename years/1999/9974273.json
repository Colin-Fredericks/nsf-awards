 "awd_abstract_narration": "9974273\r\nDrumheller\r\nThis project will investigate nonlinear excitations in low-dimensional magnets.  During the onset of magnetic ordering in lower-dimensional magnetic systems, the correlation length increases as the critical temperature is approached from above.  In this temperature region where the correlation length is finite, nonlinear localized excitations (solitons) have been experimentally observed in layered manganese systems.  It has further been observed that these excitations provide the dominant contribution to the spin correlations as observed through the temperature-dependent electron spin resonance linewidth.  In addition, a new type of small soliton pinned to a magnetic vacancy has also been observed.  In the proposed research, solitons will be studied through resonance techniques to better understand the magnetic ordering process in layered systems.  Two main thrusts will include an investigation of discrete lattice effects, and quantum effects in solitons.  Usually, soliton calculations are done using the continuum approximation, which ignores the discrete lattice.  However, because this approximation is no longer valid in part of the temperature region of interest, the soliton structure on the discrete lattice will be determined.  The quantum nature of the vacancy-pinned small soliton will also be studied.  This will be done experimentally through the introduction of a highly quantum magnetic impurity, such as copper, into the lattice.\r\n\r\nThis project will have a broad impact in the area of  education.  A graduate student will do a large part of the experimental research, and the discrete lattice theory is well suited to undergraduate research.  All of the systems to be studied are layered manganese compounds, a class of compounds for which giant magnetoresistance (GMR) has been observed.  For potential device applications, it is crucial to have knowledge of the magnetic ordering process in these layered structures.  \r\n",
