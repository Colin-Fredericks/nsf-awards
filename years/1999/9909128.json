 "awd_abstract_narration": "These studies will utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to\r\nexamine the changes in brain activity that accompany adaptation to stress.\r\nThere is little known about the changes in brain activity associated with\r\nadaptation to acute stress even though the neurochemical and hormonal\r\nadaptations to stress are well known.   Two closely related species, the\r\ncotton-top tamarin and the common marmoset which have many biological and\r\nbehavioral similarities but have very distinct temperaments will be studied.\r\nThe marmoset is calmer and less anxious while the tamarin is extremely\r\nexcitable and prone to stress-related diseases like colitis and colon\r\ncancer.  Male marmosets and tamarins will be fitted into a custom designed\r\nhead and body restrainer and imaged while fully conscious inside the MRI\r\ndevice for one hour each day over several consecutive days.  Their brain\r\nactivity as measured by small magnetic shifts associated with changes in\r\nblood flow to areas of increased neuronal activity will be compared and\r\ncorrelated with saliva concentration of a stress hormones as they adapt to\r\nthe stress of repeated immobilization.\r\n\r\nThese studies will provide a global perspective on the neural networks in\r\nthe brain which are involved in the adaptation to repeated acute stress in\r\nnon-human primates with different temperaments.  With the advent of\r\nnoninvasive fMRI  in awake animals, it is now possible to follow the same\r\nanimal over several stressful events and map the global changes in brain\r\nactivity accompanying adaptation.\r\n",
