 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed toward achieving greater understanding of the mechanism(s) of spontaneous lateral composition modulation during epitaxy of compound semiconductors. The approach is to examine interactions between the morphology and chemistry of structures exhibiting lateral composition modulation grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy and studied with in situ Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. Details of adatom interactions with surface features, adatom incorporation into the lattice, and morphological evolution will be studied. It is anticipated that these studies will provide the basis for greater understanding, and the development of new models of strained-layer alloy growth including morphological and chemical evolution, and assist in the application of these structures to novel low dimensional devices. \r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new aspects of electronic/photonic devices.  The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving the perform-ance of advanced devices and circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and materials combinations. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.  \r\n***\r\n",
