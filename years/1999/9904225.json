 "awd_abstract_narration": "H. Floyd Davis of Cornell University is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform detailed experimental studies of the bimolecular reactions of transition metal atoms under well-defined conditions using crossed molecular beams.  Studies will focus on reactions that involve ground electronic states as well as metastable electronically excited states of transition metal atoms prepared by laser excitation.  Chemical reaction products and nonreactively scattered transition metal atoms will be detected using electronic impact, vacuum ultraviolet photoionization, or 1+1 resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI).  Angular and velocity distributions of these products will be measured as a function of collision energies to gain insights into the reaction mechanisms and excess energy disposal into product degrees of freedom.  Potential energy barriers for key processes such as C-H insertion will be determined.  Results from these experiments will facilitate direct tests of state of the art ab initio calculations in the field of transition metal quantum chemistry. \r\n\r\nThe ability of transition metal centers to initiate chemical change in normally unreactive covalent bonds is of major importance in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, as well as in organic and or organometallic chemistry.  The underlying factors controlling the insertion of neutral metals into various organic bonds remain poorly understood despite interest in achieving this knowledge.  The present studies aim to further comprehension of physical and chemical interactions between transition metal compounds and smaller hydrocarbon molecules.  The outcomes will provide experimental information for useful comparison with theory. \r\n\r\n",
