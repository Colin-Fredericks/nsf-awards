 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to achieve greater understanding of carrier dynamics in disordered electronic materials. The research will apply new techniques involving recently developed methods for the generation and detection of femtosecond pulses in the far-infrared (terahertz frequency range) to probe carrier processes in amorphous and microcrystalline silicon, and in related materials. Experiments are designed to address unresolved issues in the transport properties of these materials by probing the carrier dynamics on a previously unexplored energy scale corresponding to localized states near the mobility edge. Experiments are also planned to investigate the fundamental nature of two-level tunneling states in amorphous materials. The role of disorder in the electronic properties will be addressed in measurements on a series of well-characterized samples, including films with controlled degrees of order produced by the hot-wire-assisted chemical vapor deposition technique. \r\n%%% \r\nThis is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level of special relevance to the behavior of electronic materials. The project also places emphasis on the integration of research and education through graduate and undergraduate student participation in research, and involves a special summer Research Assistantship to encourage participation of underrepresented minorities and women students in research. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities). \r\n***\r\n",
