 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research examines how innovative procedures for environmental dispute resolution are viewed by the public and how these process perceptions affect reactions to the outcome of the dispute resolution process. The research uses repeated panel surveys of active participants and of people affected by the outcome of an ongoing environmental policy process. The dispute resolution process under study is a scientific water quality modeling process that makes policies for lowering nutrient pollution levels in North Carolina rivers. The research focuses on the cognitive, social, and political factors affecting fairness judgments and policy acceptance in three groups: active participants in the citizen input process (mostly representatives of environmental and industry interest groups and city governments), the general population living in areas adjacent to the rivers, and a special group consisting of African-American farmers and farm workers in areas near the rivers.\r\n\r\nThe research seeks to fill an important gap in our existing knowledge of the psychology of dispute resolution and public policy.  Where then do the process perceptions come from and how do the effects of process perceptions merge with the effects of pre-existing attitudes and ideologies, and with self-interest concerns, to determine whether a policy is accepted or rejected? This is the central scientific topic of the proposed research. Answering this question will advance our understanding of a key psychological process in law in action, and it will suggest ways to improve policy-making processes like the environmental dispute resolution process under study here. The proposed research will also provide data on the perception of pollution policy and pollution policy-making processes by a minority population, and thus will offer guidance to policy makers about how to develop policy more acceptable to disadvantaged populations.\r\n\r\n",
