 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the PI's studies of mathematical models \r\nfor thin films of viscous liquids. A characteristic \r\nfeature of these problems is that there is a competition between \r\ndifferent physical effects, such as gravity and surface tension.  \r\nSpecifically, the partial differential equations that describe the \r\nthin film evolution equation have both linearly stabilizing terms (from surface\r\ntension) that lead to smooth film profiles and terms (from gravity, for example) \r\nthat destabilize long length scales.  The models thus exhibit a finite band of linearly \r\nunstable modes, leading to interesting steady states or long-time \r\ndynamics and to new finite-time singularities. These models will\r\nbe studied with analytical, numerical, and asymptotic techniques.\r\n\r\nPattern formation in fluid films is very familiar.  For example, when a liquid\r\nis spilled on a table, what determines the size, distribution, and shape \r\nof the droplets that form?  How does the composition of a paint affect\r\nthe irregularities that form when it dries?  What properties of an \r\ninhalant will allow it to spread most effectively on lung tissue?  \r\nIn all these situations there is a competition between \"smoothing\" \r\nand \"roughening\" physical effects.  These effects are often unavoidable and\r\ntypically lead to the formation of persistent or transient patterns.  The \r\naward will support mathematical work on the formation and development\r\nof such patterns in thin liquid films. Understanding such phenomena is of \r\nmathematical and scientific interest, as well as of engineering, industrial, \r\nand medical use.\r\n\r\n",
