 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for improvement of quantitative precipitation forecasts, which are particularly deficient over regions of complex terrain, has been designated as a key research objective by the U.S. Weather Research Program.  This emphasis is justified in part by a history of relatively infrequent but cataclysmic warm-season orographic flood events that have resulted in an large loss of life and property at various locations across the U.S.  Increasingly recognized is the potentially disastrous impact of cool-season heavy orographic precipitation accompanying landfalling baroclinic cyclones and even some periods of relatively steady but moist onshore flow.  These events, whose effects sometimes extend far downstream from the mountain slopes upon which the heaviest precipitation falls, significantly impact public safety, transportation, agriculture, power generation/distribution, and other economic concerns in and around major mountain ranges in the western U.S., many of which border on rapidly expanding population centers.  As these populations grow there is a need to better manage (and hence forecast) water resources supporting urban regions and lowland agriculture. \r\n\r\nCurrent understanding of the morphology and underlying dynamics of orographic precipitation systems is deficient when compared to analogous phenomena such as mesoscale convective systems and banded baroclinic precipitation structures.  Recent advances in remote sensing technology provide new tools to attack the problem of heavy precipitation events and associated floods in regions of complex terrain.  The upcoming field phase of the Mesoscale Alpine Programme (MAP), to be conducted over the Alpine region of central Europe during the late summer/early autumn of 1999, represents a unique and valuable opportunity to advance understanding in this area.  In conjunction with scientific leaders in the European community, the MAP U.S. Development Team has defined a sub-program that will take advantage of the unique observational infrastructure found in the Alpine region to support research directly relevant to improved understanding of processes that culminate in heavy orographic precipitation over the U.S. and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe research to be conducted under this award centers on the collection and analysis of Doppler radar data from mobile platforms (both ground-based and airborne) to complement a variety of additional observations being collected under the MAP aegis.  Research objectives include: (1) develop a conceptual model of the orographic precipitation system stretching from coastal areas to the mountain crest; (2) determine the subsynoptic and mesoscale kinematics and their impact on orographic precipitation; (3) use the above for validation and refinement of mesoscale model simulations of orographic events.  This research builds on the Principal Investigator's previously published studies of warm-season convective systems and his current research focusing on airborne radar observations of cool-season baroclinic storm systems in regions of steeply rising coastal terrain.  \r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this research should improve knowledge of orographic precipitation systems and potentially improve forecasting \r\n",
