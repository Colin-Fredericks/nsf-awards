 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project significantly expands the utility of educational materials based on the C-Fem (Ceratopteris) system. Much needed enhancements of the components and capabilities of CFem, especially in the saprophytic phase of the life cycle, will increase its accessibility and functionality in a wide range of educational settings. At the end of the requested funding period, C-Fem will be a mature and substantially self-generating system that will provide a unique and significant component to the biological curriculum. C-Fem is user-friendly, inexpensive and broadly applicable in a number of different educational settings. Rather than being just another life cycle, this system can illustrate in vivid ways a variety of biological principles. The distinctive sporophytic and gametophytic generations along with swimming sperm, pheromonal control of distinct sexual types, a short life cycle, development from a single cell and a wide variety of mutant stocks will combine to make this a versatile tool in the classroom or for independent research. It is especially well suited for inquiry applications and provides unique opportunities for adaptation in the genetics laboratory. There are two major materials development initiatives associated with this proposal: 1) Large-scale mutagenesis and selection in the sporophyte generation in order to obtain mutations that show significant time reductions in the sporophytic phase of the life cycle. 2) Expansion of the genetic applications of C-Fem through the generation of mono- and dihybrid mutant lines and the incorporation of sporophytic improvements from the first initiative. With these improvements, C-Fem is poised to become a principal organism in the biology classroom.",
