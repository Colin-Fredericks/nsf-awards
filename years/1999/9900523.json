 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wurtele\r\n\r\nThe symposium \"Metabolic Networking in Plants\" to be held April 22-25, 1999 at Iowa State University, will focus on the interconnections between metabolic pathways of plants. Subthemes are the use of functional genomics in metabolic analyses; impact of environment on interconnections between metabolic pathways; impact of development on interconnections between metabolic pathways; the regulation of metabolic pathways; and novel approaches to modeling and integration. The atmosphere will be informal and the format allows for extensive discussion both during and between sessions. An important purpose of these symposia is to promote interactions and new collaborations between individuals who might not normally come together at a single symposium. In doing this, we will include a spectra of attendees ranging from world famous scientists to highly promising students and post-doctoral fellows.\r\n\r\nAs we approach the time of the first total-plant-sequence, we need to use the wealth of information for understanding genome function in defining intricate metabolic networks. We need to undertake the task of functional assignments to batteries of genes on a large scale, identify interrelations among different metabolic pathways and decipher the interplay in their modulation by environmental and developmental cues. To achieve these shifts in our research paradigm, it is necessary to foster interdisciplinary research efforts for global analysis of metabolic pathways. We also need to train young scientists to approach plant metabolism with global analytical tools. We see the symposium as a way to educate students and post-doctoral associates and to promote meaningful collaborations and interdisciplinary interactions among established scientists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
