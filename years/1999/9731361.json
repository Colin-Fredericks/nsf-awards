 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731361\r\nMacLaughlin\r\n\r\nElectronic structure, magnetism, and superconductivity in highly correlated electron materials (heavy-fermion metals, and transition metal oxides) will be investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon spin rotation (mSR) techniques. NMR and mSR are sensitive to microscopic (atomic) charge and spin correlations and make excellent local probes of strong electron correlation. The techniques are applied to a number of problems in strongly correlated-electron physics, including (1) the effect of disorder on non-Fermi-liquid behavior in heavy-fermion compounds and alloys, (2) nonmagnetic Kondo phenomena in non-Kramers f-electron compounds, (3) paramagnetic NMR/mSR frequency shifts and unconventional superconductivity in UBe13 and its alloys, and (4) mSR studies of doped lanthanum cuprates and colossal magnetoresistance manganites. The grant will provide graduate training in state-of-the-art magnetic resonance techniques. The research will be carried out in collaboration with researchers in government (Los Alamos National Laboratory, Iowa State Ames Laboratory) and industrial (Lucent Technologies Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill) laboratories and with research groups abroad (Leiden, Zurich).\r\n%%% \r\nThis projects investigates the way interactions among electrons influence the magnetism and conduction in solids. This so-called strongly correlated electron problem is a major unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. It is a fundamental issue that has technological implications in many technological areas. This project employs magnetic resonance techniques as probes of correlated-electron behavior at the atomic level. In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), \"probe\" nuclear magnetic moments, similar to compass magnets, sense the local magnetic environment created by the surrounding electrons. This research should lead to a better understanding of the behavior of heavy-electron metals, in which electrons behave as if they were hundreds or even thousands of times more massive than electrons in ordinary metals. The project also deals with metal-oxide colossal magnetoresistance materials which have potential for applications in information storage technology. The grant will provide graduate training in state-of-the-art magnetic resonance techniques. The research will be carried out in collaboration with researchers in government (Los Alamos National Laboratory, Iowa State Ames Laboratory) and industrial (Lucent Technologies Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill) laboratories and with research groups abroad (Leiden, Zurich).\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
