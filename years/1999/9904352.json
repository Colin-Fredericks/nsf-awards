The particular composite system to be studied has double cemented carbide granules (DCC) within a matrix of cobalt, steel, or other metal.  The project involves creating composites with wide variations in microstructural properties, such as granule size, volume fraction, toughness, matrix metal and associated heat treatment, and interface strength.  Specimens are produced by blending the desired grades of carbide granules with the metal-matrix powders and hot pressing to produce fully dense DCC composites.  Mechanical properties are measured, including four-point bend strength, fracture toughness, hardness, and wear and thermal fatigue resistance, for each microstructural variation.  Mechanical property measurements involving wear testing of the composites are performed by the UAB students at Smith International, Inc. (SII) in Houston, TX.  Functional tests such as fatigue life of shaped rock drill inserts and drilling performance of optimized DCC compositions are performed by SII personnel.  The measured mechanical properties of the hybrid composite will be related to the composite microstructure and the intrinsic properties of the reinforcement and toughening phases via three-dimensional stereological modeling.  These data are also used to evaluate the applicability of current composite models to DCC materials.  This GOALI activity is co-funded with the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n%%%\r\nThis program provides an opportunity to explore the nature of a new family of composite materials with unique combinations of high fracture toughness and wear resistance.  These composites show great promise for applications in a wide range of industrial applications, such as high performance bits for oil well drilling that require properties typical of cemented carbides with significantly greater toughness.\r\n***\r\n",
