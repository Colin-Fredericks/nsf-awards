 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Virtual Exploratorium or VE (a World Wide Web and CD ROM-based educational resource) addresses a national call for inquiry-based materials in the geosciences at the introductory survey level adaptable to a variety of instructional approaches.  Our Pyramid Framework approach fosters understanding through scientific exploration of geoscience phenomena and processes relevant to the broad geoscience community, i.e., volcanoes and plate-tectonics; and hurricanes and their interactions with oceans and land; and fluid visualizations.  We have developed comprehensive scenarios addressing these phenomena and processes through a focus on fundamental principles, building blocks established from these principles, and processes explored through the use of building blocks.  Within the VE there are learner-centered scientific modeling and visualization tools, discovery-based curricular elements that use these tools, a series of data sets of relevant phenomena, and a virtual encyclopedia of basic scientific concepts. These components are created/adapted from advanced scientific modeling and visualization capabilities that utilize rapidly evolving desktop computing capabilities and the World Wide Web. Simpler fluid models and visualizations are being developed. \r\nVE materials are developed with input from the geoscience community and a national advisory group with expertise that includes: 1)  cognition, learning theory, and science education; 2)  advanced visualization and numerical modeling; and 3) in evaluation and assessment.  Materials are being evaluated at ten institutions including 4-year, 2-year and underrepresented institutions representative of the geoscience community. The materials will continue to be maintained at the University of Illinois and PAGE, and will be accessible through our website and CDs. We also provide support to faculty seeking to incorporate these tools into their courses. PAGE provides a singular opportunity to nationally distribute the products.",
