Symposium expenses could be a deterrent for graduate students planning to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nNAPS  is an annual conference, sponsored by the Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and a selected university on the North American Continent.  At this conference, university professors and students are encouraged to present the results of their research among colleagus at an early stage in their work.\r\n\r\nNAPS participants are from the electrical engineering departments of major universities in the country with research interests in different areas of power engineering, some from the university abroad, and some from industry.  NAPS authors are required to attend the conference and present their papers.\r\n\r\n",
