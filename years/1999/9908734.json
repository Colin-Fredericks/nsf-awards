 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) will conduct a four-week summer residential program in chemistry, physics, mathematics and engineering for 30 girls entering grade eleven. Students will work on individual or team research problems during the summer and continue these during the academic year and will be encouraged to enter their projects at the Regional Science Fair Competition at SIUE in spring, 2001. They will participate in Saturday programs during the academic year and continue to receive help from SIUE faculty with their projects.\r\n\t\r\nThe theme for the summer program will be water quality, investigating both the quality of surface water and water treatment facilities. Instruction in mathematics and the use of computer technology will be integrated into the science and engineering program. Topics in mathematics will include mathematical functional forms, progressing from linear relationships to polynomials to logarithmic and exponential functions to periodic functions, and interpretation of data and error analysis.  Instruction on computers will include computer-aided design (CAD), spreadsheets and graphs, and research using the Internet.\r\n",
