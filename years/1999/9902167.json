Researchers have uncovered a startling array of biological traits that males have evolved to enhance their success in obtaining mates. This study seeks to examine how females might influence the process of sexual selection, and in particular, the way in which sperm from multiple males compete within a female's reproductive tract in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  The first component of this study will examine how patterns of sperm competition vary among different female genotypes. The second component will look at the relationship between how attractive a male is and the ability of his sperm to compete with other males' sperm. The final component will determine whether males with experimentally reduced attractiveness have reduced sperm competitive ability, due to facultative responses in the female.\r\n\r\nWhile the male role in sexual selection has been examined extensively, far less is known of the female role. Typically, females have been considered as passive participants whose preferences and other reproductive behaviors vary little.  In order to more fully understand reproductive decisions in general, we need to add a more complete understanding of the female perspective to what we already know about the mating decisions of males.\r\n\r\n",
