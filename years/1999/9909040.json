 "awd_abstract_narration": "Howard University\r\n\r\nHoward University has a long and dedicated history of awarding African Americans degrees in science, engineering and mathematics (SEM). However, in spite of the efforts of Howard and other institutions, there remains a definite shortage of underrepresented minorities earning degrees in SEM fields. Howard University proposes to build upon existing SEM-related projects to double the production of Bachelor of Science degrees in SEM over the next five years and to increase the numbers of SEM graduates who are academically prepared and motivated to pursue advanced degrees. Specifically, Howard intends to implement the Howard University Science, Engineering and Mathematics (HUSEM) program.\r\n\r\nHUSEM is a program that integrates enhanced educational activities and dedicated mentoring and advising activities that include technology-based introductory mathematics and science courses, undergraduate research-for-credit, and teamwork-based learning environment. Through HUSEM, SEM faculty will be introduced to emerging SEM pedagogy in formalized seminars, workshops and short courses in Howard's Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. HUSEM will collaborate with the NSF-supported Minority Graduate Education (MGE) Program, housed in the Graduate School of Howard University, to provide a natural transition in preparing students for graduate school.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive evaluation program will focus on SEM retention rates, number of SEM majors involved in research, and the academic preparedness of students for graduate study.\r\n\r\n",
