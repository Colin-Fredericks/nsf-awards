 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Gordon Conference will be held in July, 1999 on Electronic Materials: Chemistry, Excitations and Processing. The conference focuses on the most exciting developments in the processing and usage of electronic materials.  New materials, new uses, new probes, and new methods are emphasized rather than incremental developments in existing technologies and methodology.  The conference seeks to attract participants from industry, academia, and government laboratories, to help those communities learn from each other.  It provides a stimulating environment for students planning a career in electronic materials, a field of research that is exciting, is important to the national economy, and is not yet represented in the traditional curriculum at the leading Universities. Support from NSF will be used to partially compensate young scientists (junior faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) for travel and accommodation expenses. The conference is expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical scientific issues in electronic/photonic materials.  Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established between universities, research institutions, and industry.  \r\n%%%\r\n Electronic/photonic materials have far reaching economic potential since applications range broadly across electronics and photonics associated with computing, communications, and information processing. An evaluation of the progress and status of this field along with current assessments of the most important developments will be of great value to the understanding and enhanced utilization of these materials in applications beneficial to society. \t \r\n***\r\n",
