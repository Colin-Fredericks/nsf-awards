 "awd_abstract_narration": "T. Perney\r\n9876321\r\n\r\nPotassium channels are pore-like structures, which allow the flux of potassium ions across a cell's membrane in a regulated manner. They are important for all cells, but have a particularly critical role in heart, muscle, and nerve cells where they control the pattern of electrical signaling. The channels are formed by the assembly of four pore domain containing subunits. This assembly is mediated by a region of the channel, which has been termed the NAB or Ti domain. We have identified a new class of proteins, termed Nabs, which contain a Ti-like domain, but no pore domain. A molecular biological approach called the two hybrid interaction trap coupled with classic biochemical techniques will be used to determine whether the Ti domain in the Nab proteins mediate protein-protein assembly and if so, to identify the binding partners. The expression levels of one of the Nab proteins has been shown to be increased by cytokines, molecules involved in mediating both normal development and the inflammation response after injury. Gene expression profiles for the different Nabs will be examined by in situ hybridization and immunological techniques during normal brain development, after brain injury, and in response to cytokines. Taken together, these studies should increase our understanding of the structure function relationships of Ti domains and may also provide insight into the functional role of Nab proteins including any potential involvement in the cellular response to injury. High school, undergraduate and graduate students will actively participate in development and performance of the project. In addition, strategies to promote critical thinking will be incorporated into three redesigned courses to enhance the understanding of Molecular and Neurosciences and their impact on society. An outreach program to local elementary schools will also be expanded to promote the inclusion of the scientific discovery process in the science curriculum.\r\n",
