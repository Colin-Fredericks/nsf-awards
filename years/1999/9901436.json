The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\nThis award will provide Dr. Sawako Nakamae with support for twelve months to work with Dr. Kamran Behnia at the Universite Paris-Sud in Orsay, France.\r\nIn recent years, unconventional behavior in the thermal conductivity of high-Tc cuprate superconductors at low temperature and in magnetic field was reported.  A conclusive theoretical explanation for the phenomena has not been found.  The goal of this research is to study the thermal Hall effect (thermal conductivity in the direction normal to the heat current and the applied magnetic field)  in cuprate superconductors to experimentally reveal the physics behind the phenomena.  These experiments should generate a greater understanding of this unique area of superconductivity and provide fundamental insights into the nature of this phenomena.  The experiment will also be used to study other types of unconventional superconductors such as organic and heavy fermion superconductors.\r\nThe Laboratoire de Physique des Solides at the Universite Paris-Sud has the equipment and facilities to conduct this research.  In addition, the host research group was one of the very first groups to observe/report these new phenomena in thermal conductivity of single crystal samples. \r\n***\r\n",
