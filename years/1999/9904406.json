 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference on biology and chemistry of vision is one of an annual series.  Research on vision has, more than any other sensory system, involved great participation of different disciplines from molecular biology through psychology.  Advances in the biology of vision are very broadly interesting and relevant to fields such as development, molecular biology, protein structure, and signal transduction, as well as health.  This year there will be continued coverage of the rapidly progressing story of how proteins are involved in the phototransduction cascade, and how genetics can clarify photoreceptor function.  The sessions are organized around questions instead of techniques, and this year there will be expanded discussion on photoreceptor adaptation and inactivation, and on the results from cross-disciplinary collaborations.\r\n   The impact on visual science will come from the close interactions across different approaches presented at this conference.  Added impact comes from integrating young investigators into discussions with leaders in the field, to have an impact on their careers.\r\n",
