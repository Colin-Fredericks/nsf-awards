 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nVolatile compounds play an important role in plants as insect attractants,\r\nrepellents and signal molecules.  Floral scent is a key modulating factor\r\nin plant-insect interactions and plays a central role in successful \r\npollination, and thus in fruit development of many crop species.  Despite\r\nthe economic importance of floral scent for plant reproduction, little is\r\nknown about the molecular mechanisms involved in the production of floral \r\nvolatiles.  The objectives of this proposal are to use molecular, genetic,\r\nand biochemical approaches to understand how production of volatiles could\r\nbe manipulated in plants using floral scent as a model system. Although\r\nproduction of scent volatile compounds appears to be very widespread in the\r\nplant kingdom, the information about their biosynthesis and regulation is\r\nlimited and based to date on the analysis of a single model system -\r\nClarkia.  Bee-pollinated Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon) will be used as a\r\nmodel system for this study due to its important advantages over the\r\nClarkia system such as a well developed genetic map, transposon gene\r\ncloning system, available transformation protocol, and rhythmic emission.\r\nFloral scent is often a complex mixture of low molecular weight compounds,\r\nwhich are mainly distributed within three groups: fatty acid derivatives,\r\nbenzenoids and isoprenoids.  Esters of such compounds are among the most \r\ncommon in many plant species where they contribute significantly to the\r\ntotal floral scent output. However, the biochemical pathways, enzymes and\r\ngenes controlling the biosynthesis of volatile esters in plants have \r\nreceived little attention.  The focus of the proposed research is on the\r\nmolecular mechanisms of the synthesis of the volatile ester methylbenzoate,\r\nan important insect attractant and a major component of snapdragon floral \r\nscent.  This research specifically addresses the questions of how plants\r\nregulate the production of volatile esters and how pollination and\r\ncircadian rhythm affect scent emission at the molecular level.  The\r\navailability of a cloned S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic acid carboxyl\r\nmethyltransferase  (BAMT), the final enzyme in the biosynthesis of\r\nmethylbenzoate, recently isolated in the PI's lab, provides a unique\r\nopportunity to make a detailed study of the regulation of floral scent\r\nproduction.  The mode of expression of BAMT gene will be characterized in\r\ndifferent tissues during flower development to determine the molecular\r\nmechanisms (transcriptional, translational or post-translational) involved\r\nin the regulation of methylbenzoate emission. Special attention will be\r\npaid to comparative analyses of Antirrhinum varieties that emit\r\nmethylbenzoate with \r\nnon-emitting plants.  To determine the specific molecular and biochemical\r\nmechanisms that are \r\nresponsible for the postpollination changes in floral scent production in\r\nplants, the levels of BAMT mRNA, BAMT protein, BAMT activity, emission, and\r\nthe possible accumulation of methylbenzoate inside the cells will be\r\ndetermined at different times after pollination.  Overall, this research\r\nwill lead to significant contributions to \r\nunderstanding of the fundamental processes underlying the formation of\r\nfloral scent. While this proposal is designed primarily to address\r\nfundamental questions about molecular mechanisms controlling production of \r\nvolatiles in plants, the results obtained may ultimately find application\r\nin agriculture and horticulture.  An understanding of the enzymology and\r\nregulation of metabolic pathways (including developmental changes and \r\nsubcellular compartmentation), obtained in these studies, will provide the\r\nknowledge for engineering plants with improved scent quality to increase\r\nthe attraction of pollinators to flowers and thereby increase the yield of \r\nimportant agricultural crops.",
