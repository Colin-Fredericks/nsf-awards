 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Brooks Ellwood and Francis Harrold will apply the technique of magnetosusceptibility (MS) correlation to a series of archaeological sites in Southern Europe. This technique, which is still in the process of development, is based on the fact that climate affects the magnetic properties of sediments. In unconsolidated samples such as those excavated from archaeological sites MS works as a climatic proxy because temperature and moisture control the magnetic properties of deposited sediments, primarily as the result of pedogenesis. There is higher production of magnetic materials with corresponding increases in MS during periods when climate is relatively warm and wet. Given this fact, one can sample stratigraphic archaeological sections and construct magnetic curves which, when constrained by paleontological and oxygen isotope stage data, can be cross correlated. On this basis the investigators hope to establish a composite reference curve which will then permit fitting of smaller sequences from individual sites.\r\n\r\nIn collaboration with the relevant archaeologists, Drs. Ellwood and Harrold will visit a number of Middle and Upper Paleolithic sites in Spain, Portugal and France to collect and analyze sediment samples. The resultant curves should prove useful for dating over a large portion of Western and Southern Europe and will, hopefully, cover ca. 200,000 years. This is a particularly important period because it witnessed the replacement of Neanderthals by anatomically modern humans and the emergence of societies with cultural capabilities equal to our own. This research is also important because it will help to refine a tool potentially useful in many archaeological settings.\r\n",
