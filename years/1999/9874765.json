Furthermore, detailed x-ray studies are planned to elucidate the electronic and molecular structure of these materials in thin films and at device interfaces.  A major goal will be to implement strong interdisciplinary collaborations between the departments of Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering.  This research program offers a unique opportunity for undergraduate and graduate student researchers in all three departments because of its  interdisciplinary nature.  For example students will work together to accomplish the design, synthesis and characterization of new materials as well as the fabrication and testing of devices.  The main educational objective is to recruit and better prepare undergraduates for research endeavors at an earlier stage in their academic career.  This will be accomplished through proposed course curriculum enhancements in the Organic Chemistry Program and the development of interdepartmental courses in Advanced Topics of Materials.\r\n%%%\r\nThe design, synthesis and characterization of organic materials exhibiting electroluminescence is highly relevant to important technologies that include various full-color, flat-panel display applications.  A fuller understanding of the electronic and molecular structure of organic materials and methods for controlling their optical properties in thin films and at device interfaces is needed to advance the development of various device applications areas.\r\n***\r\n",
