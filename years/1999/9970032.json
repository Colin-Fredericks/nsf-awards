 "awd_abstract_narration": "Charles Wight of the University of Utah is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program and Eastern Europe Program to continue his studies of free radical intermediates and radical-molecule complexes generated in cryochemical reactions of fluorine and oxygen atoms with guest molecules in a free-standing rare gas crystals.  This project facilitates an international collaboration between Wight's research group at the University of Utah and scientists at the Institute for Chemical Physics Research at Chernogolovka, Russia.  The collaborative approach will employ complementary techniques such as high-resolution EPR, FTIR, and ultraviolet spectroscopy to investigate the reaction pathways of interest in highly ordered large crystals at cryogenic temperatures.  The research is expected to lead to the determination of branching ratios for reaction channels of atoms and photochemical yields of reaction products, the structure and lattice sites of intermediate species, and distinctions between reaction products arising from photogenerated and diffusing thermal atoms.  The targets of the studies represent chemical reactions that are relevant to contemporary problems in atmospheric and combustion chemistry.  The outcomes from this effort are expected to provide insights into the role of long-lived intermediate complexes that are formed near to the transition state of chemical reactions. \r\n\r\nThe dynamics of atom-molecule chemical reactions is important in a variety of areas, including atmospheric chemistry, combustion/flaming suppression, plasma etching in the microelectronics industry, and chemical lasers.   When energetic chemical reactions are performed in cold crystals, reaction products are prevented from flying apart as they do in gas phase reactions.  Chemical intermediate complexes that are not observable in gas phase reactions can then be studied using spectroscopic approaches to elucidate the structure and kinetic behavior of these important and elusive reactive species.\r\n\r\n",
