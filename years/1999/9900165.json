 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the set of problems which must be solved to produce a new class of precision motion machines capable of rapidly moving over a planar surface and subsequently positioning to sub-micrometer precision without the need to provide air, power, and signals over a tether as is the case with today's technology.  Planar linear motors currently used in industry operate with a tether in an open-loop stepping manner.  This mode of operation makes them restricted in range of motion, susceptible to loss of steps, unable to reject external disturbances (such as tugs on the tether), unable to provide controlled forces, and unable to provide high stiffness.  A previous NSF-funded project produced technology advances allowing integrated robust position sensing and control for this class of motors, providing improved motion characteristics including better disturbance rejection, better resolution, and reduced energy consumption.  Building on these results, the present project will explore optimal energy utilization, innovative frictionless bearing design, and innovative integrated computing and communications technology to eliminate the need for a tether.\r\n     Elimination of the tether will allow machines based on planar motors to be completely free-roaming over their corresponding stator surfaces.  This will enable significant improvement in the operation of a wide range of systems, including manufacturing systems, that are based on these motors.\r\n",
