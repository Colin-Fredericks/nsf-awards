 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a POWRE grant looking at H-Ras, a  small GTPase, which activates several signal transduction cascades that control cell growth and shape, through alterations of the cell cycle machinery, changes in gene expression and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. HRas proteins interact with multiple target proteins, but at present it is unclear how the particular responses to HRas activation can arise.  HRas proteins must be attached  (tethered ) to the cell's plasma membrane in order to productively interact with whatever proteins are their partners in signaling.  Tethering results from attachment of lipids to the C-terminus of HRas proteins HRas has 2 lipids attached to cysteine residues - the isoprenoid farnesyl and palmitate fatty acids.  Recent evidence suggests that these lipids may also affect the function of HRas.  This investigator has replaced the farnesylation site at the C terminus with 6 lysine residues.  This protein, Ext61L, has an enhanced ability to cause differentiation in PC 12 cells and increases phosphatidylinositol (PI) -3 kinase. This research is aimed at determining the molecular basis for this activation of Ras function by C-terminal mutation.  The first aim is to determine if the particular C-terminal changes in ExtRas have physically or functionally altered its interaction between ExtRas and PI3K, by directly measuring the activity of PI3-K, and by using inhibitors of the PI3-K pathway in intact PC12 cells. The second aim is to to define the minimal C-terminal structure that can support palmitoylation and membrane binding; and identify the positions and types of residues that can potentiate the differentiative function of cellular HRas.  New C-terminal mutants of ExtRas, with reduced numbers of sites for palmitoylation and an altered distribution of charged residues will be constructed, expressed, and monitored for loss of the ability to cause neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells.  The long-term goal of this project is to understand how HRas proteins select their partners, and the impact of those choices on HRas function. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
