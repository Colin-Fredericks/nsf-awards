The PI seeks to extend previous work that found a simple mathematical description of the individual ridges that make up a crumpled sheet. Further work is aimed at finding mathematical relations that determine when and how the ridges will buckle.  The crumpling of materials down to smaller and smaller volumes will be investigated with the aim of finding characteristic features of the process that are universal.  The PI will also investigate the packing of granular materials (e.g. sandpiles). Using numerical simulations of perfectly hard, small frictionless spheres, the PI will study the microscopic motion of the grains that occurs in response to small disturbances.  The smallest disturbances that lead to microscopic motion will be sought in an effort to understand how grains move and how forces redistribute under disturbances that lead to settling.  \r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical research on how materials, like paper, crumble and how grains move as granular materials (for example, grains of sand in sandpiles) settle or respond to some disturbance. The PI will use sophisticated mathematical techniques and computer simulations to gain insight into crumpling and granular motion. These processes are important to the understanding of materials and are ubiquitous in our everyday experience. Students and the next generation of researchers will receive high quality educational experiences as the research progresses.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
