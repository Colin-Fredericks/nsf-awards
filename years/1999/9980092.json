 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are several varieties of \"evolutionary computation\" based on analogies from the theory of natural evolution. In molecular biology, similar analogies are the basis of experiments on \"in vitro evolution.\"  From the beginning of DNA computing there has been an obvious appeal to the idea of marrying these two approaches. This KDI project brings these two approaches together. It provides DNA implementations for executing and assessing two classes of Genetic Algorithm computations, using population sizes larger than is usually practical with conventional computers. This project has two major goals addressing two problem types from the practice of Genetic Algorithms. The first goal is to demonstrate a DNA computation of a classic Genetic Algorithms test problem known as \"Max 1s.\" This test problem evolves a given initial population of bitstrings until some bitstrings match a predetermined target. Two-dimensional denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is used in the laboratory to physically separate candidate strands of DNA according to how well they match copies of a prespecified target strand.  Molecular biological techniques are adapted to perform crossover, random mutation, and amplification of candidates. The second major goal demonstrates a class of Genetic Algorithms computations known as \"Cold War problems.\" These problems do not involve prespecified matching targets; hence they produce outcomes which are not obvious in advance. In a Cold War problem, DNA strands encode two populations of \"offers.\" In every generation these encoded offers are separately evolved by each of two proposers according to their own private preferences. When the two populations are combined, DGGE physically separates the most nearly matched pairs of offers.\r\nPartially matched offers are returned to their respective proposers to become the \"parents\" of the next generation. Cold War problems are two-party specializations of multi-party coalition games with sidepayments. This project contributes to two disciplines. Evolutionary computation gains access to populations billions of times larger than are practical with conventional computers. Molecular biology is enhanced by laboratory techniques which combine both crossover and random mutation.\r\n",
