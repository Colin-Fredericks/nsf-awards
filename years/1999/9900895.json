Applications such as agile manufacturing and air traffic control have data that span the spectrum from low level control data, typically acquired from sensors, to high level management and business data.  In such applications the seamless integration of data from all levels can provide a great degree of overall benefit.  Further, in all levels of the data and processing hierarchy of such applications, real-time requirements abound.  Current databases are not time cognizant and do not perform well in these applications.  Because of this there has been a significant increase in research in real-time databases in both academia and industry and many commercial products are beginning to emerge in this area.\r\n\r\nThis research involves prototyping and evaluating a novel real-time database system.  The work builds upon previous simulation studies that identified a number of novel solutions in real-time concurrency control, real-time transaction scheduling, and admission control and resource management.  The research builds on these novel solutions together with new ideas on an enhanced object model, exploitation of reflective information, and a uniform model for multimedia quality of service resource management.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
