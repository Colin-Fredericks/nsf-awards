 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861473\r\n      This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project aims to develop a novel design of an all solid electro-chromic device based on a novel inorganic/ organic polyoxometalate polymer. The new design is composed of four layers, two transparent conductor layers (TC), an anode LiCoO2 EC layer, and a cathode inorganic/ organic polyoxometalate polymer EC layer. The advantage of this complementary design is that the electrodes are balanced and the color efficiency is enhanced. Electro-chromic (EC) materials have been studied extensively in recent years for their potential applications in display devices and in automotive and architectural glazings. These materials exhibit reversible and continuous change in their optical properties under electrically driven oxidation/reduction processes. As a result, light absorption, transmission, or reflection of EC materials can be controlled by an applied electric field.\r\n       Among all the potential applications, \"smart windows\" for efficient use of energy in buildings have drawn the most attention from researchers around the world. Smart windows represent a huge market and remarkable opportunity to save energy without sacrificing  comfort. Other potential applications include \r\ndisplay devices, automotive and architectural glazings, smart windows,  and EC glasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
