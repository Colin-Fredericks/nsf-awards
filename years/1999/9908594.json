 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fletcher.9908594\r\n\r\nThe nature of coastal change occurring over the time frame of decades to millennia, a period that is highly relevant to human concerns, is poorly understood.  For instance, scientists do not have even a rudimentary understanding of how interannual processes govern sediment sharing across the littoral energy fence.  What is the repeatability  (or variation) of states of stability or change on the inter-decadal scale?  What are the temporal and spatial characteristics of physical processes that link the shoreline to the inner shelf on the century to millennial scale?  Which of these nested time scales is responsible for the greatest amount of work in determining the fate of coastal sediments and the character of the shoreline system at any moment in time?  An improved ability to effectively answer these questions, an others, will be critically valuable to the coastal planning community, permitting authorities, and resource managers. This proposal seeks participant support funding and logistical funding to defray the cost of holding a research conference and planning workshop of international scientists active in the broad field of coastal geology.  The principal focus of the workshop is the Quaternary sedimentological history of sea-level changes and shoreline and inner shelf sedimentological processes and their past and future impact on society and human issues.  The conference will convene November 9-12, 1999 on the campus of the University of Hawaii, Honolulu.  \r\n",
