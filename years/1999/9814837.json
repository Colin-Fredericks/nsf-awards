These lakes are characterized by unusually stable redox transition zones and are especially amenable to a finely spaced sampling regime.  Collectively, they represent a broad range of water chemistries.  The proposed research will test the following hypotheses:  (1) Instratified water columns there will be a clear spatial difference between the onset of manganese reduction and the onset of iron reduction.  Heavy metals and rare earth elements will be seen to undergo co-cycling with manganese rather than with iron.  (2) In all four lakes, manganese reduction will be associated with the presence of carnobacteria or with other manganese-reducing organisms.  In brief, the study will explore the link between microbial activity and the cycling and fate of a large suite of chemical elements at key redox boundaries.  Dissolved and particulate metal profiles will be examined as a function of depth from the ice-water interface to the sediments.  Profiles will be correlated with microbial manganese-reduction assays and the presence of manganese reducers as detected by screening with Mn-oxide overlay agar plates and nucleic acid hybridizations with probes for known manganese reducers.  The research will include significant involvement of undergraduates.\r\n",
