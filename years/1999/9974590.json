Allen Miller \r\nTranslation was originally thought to be linear: ribosomes, with associated factors, recognize the messenger RNA at its 5' m7GpppG cap structure, then scan in a 3' direction to the first AUG codon at which protein synthesis begins.  Two major discoveries have changed this view: (i) the ability of certain RNA sequences to facilitate cap-independent translation, allowing the ribosome to bind internally to the cap site; and (ii) the important role of the 3' untranslated region (UTR), including the poly(A) tail, in regulating translation.  This revealed that mRNAs must be circularized by protein factors in the initiation process.  These discoveries still require that the ribosome binds the mRNA upstream of the start codon, and all 3' UTR control models rely on recognition of the 5' cap structure to circularize the mRNA.  In contrast to all known models, the investigator discovered a sequence in the 3' UTR of a plant viral genome that facilitates very efficient translation initiation at the 5' end of mRNA lacking a 5' cap and a poly(A) tail.  The goal of this research is to understand how a 3'UTR can recruit the ribosome and deliver it to a specific start codon far upstream, in the absence of a 5' cap.  The hypothesis to be tested in this work is that specific RNA sequences and structures in the 3' UTR mimic a 5' cap and a poly(A) tail and, via specific protein interactions, interact with the 5' UTR to recruit the translational machinery to the 5'-proximal AUG codon. Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of UTRs of a reporter gene mRNA that will be translated in vitro and in vivo will be used to identify the specific sequences in the UTRs that are required for ribosome recruitment and communication with the 5' end. Enzymatic and chemical probing will also be used to determine the RNA secondary structure.  Finally, a search for cellular proteins that mediate this process by using the yeast 3-hybrid system, and by RNA affinity binding columns will be initiated.  This will shed light on the surprisingly diverse ways by which the translational machinery can be assembled on an active mRNA.  \r\n\r\nThe process by which genetic information that is stored as a nucleic acid sequence is converted to a protein that carries out the functions of the cell is called translation.  This requires a complex macromolecular machine called the ribosome, along with associated protein factors, to recognize the messenger RNA (mRNA), and \"read\" it in a controlled fashion.  In addition to the portion of the mRNA that codes for a protein sequence, non-coding sequences at the ends of the mRNA often regulate its interaction with the ribosome, to control protein synthesis.  Much remains to be learned about this complex process.  Viruses often employ unconventional means of bypassing normal host translation mechanisms, that allow them to avoid host defenses.  They also serve as useful tools for understanding translation in general.  This project focuses on an unusual plant viral mRNA that has a sequence near the \"wrong\" untranslated end (\"downstream\" of the coding region), that somehow recruits the ribosome to the other end of the mRNA where translation begins.  Thus, the mRNA must be circularized.  Normal mRNAs are also circularized, via special modifications or sequences in the untranslated regions that interact with a complex assemblage of protein factors.  The viral RNA in this project lacks these modifications and sequences, and presumably has different sequences that mimic the conventional ones, and they likely interact by at least some different proteins than are used in translation of normal mRNAs.  The goal is to identify both the RNA sequences and the proteins that are involved in this process.  Translation mechanisms are fundamentally the same in all plants and animals.  Thus, this work is of fundamental relevance to our understanding of translation in both kingdoms.  Novel gene expression mechanisms first discovered in viruses often are found later to exist in cellular genes.  This work may reveal new means of controlling viruses by inhibiting gene expression mechanisms that are unique to viruses, and it may provide genetic engineering tools for constructing genes that bypass cellular mechanisms of regulating and limiting gene expression.\r\n",
