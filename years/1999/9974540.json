 "awd_abstract_narration": "The settlement patterns and adaptation process of temporary rural migrants in China's urban settings are the focus of this research.  Specifically, the study will examine the institutional factors and individual-level determinants of migrant housing settlement and the impact of residential patterns on migrant adaptation.  Close attention is paid to the role of housing and land markets in the process of migrant settlement, in the context of a rapidly urbanizing society undergoing transition from a planned to a market economy.  Data are primarily drawn from new fieldwork of citywide migrant surveys, in-depth interviews and focused observation in Beijing and Shanghai, supplemented by official survey results.  The study will use several reference groups in measuring levels of adaptation.  Temporary rural migrants will be compared with temporary migrants from urban origin, and with permanent migrants as well as urban residents, along such indicators as employment, income, housing, urban living, and access to urban amenities.  A comparison of the two cities ensures that institutional factors are uncovered as Beijing and Shanghai differ significantly in their physical, cultural and policy environment.  By theorizing the relationship between housing and adaptation, this research promises an important extension to migrant adaptation theories.  Housing is seen as an environment in which rural migrants make their adjustments to urban life, and residential patterns and outcomes are assessed to reflect their socioeconomic standing.  The key contribution of the research is in the area of changing urban identity and segregation.  Collaboration with Chinese researchers and institutions is an essential part of this research.\r\n\r\nChina's temporary rural migrants settle and adapt to urban life in cities in many different ways.  This study examines how the unique institutional factors in China, such as housing market mechanism and urban welfare system, influence migrants' choices of housing and urban living.  Housing also is seen as an environment in which rural migrants make their adjustments in cities, and residential patterns are assessed to reflect their socioeconomic standing.  Linking housing and adaptation, this research adds to the understanding of how urban segregation and marginalization occur.  While some migrants gradually adjust to urban life or choose to preserve rural linkages, others may have no choice but to become the first of an emerging group of poor in spatially segregated cities.\r\n",
