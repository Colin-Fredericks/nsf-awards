Previous experimental investigations have revealed high flow stress, extensive strain hardening, and correlation between microstructural instability and superplasticity in nanostructured materials.  A specially designed and instrumented tensile testing device has been constructed for conducting precision mechanical tests.  The nanostructure existing before and after deformation is investigated using transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry and internal friction methods.  The scientific goal is to correlate the microstructural information with the mechanical data obtained to improve theoretical models of superplasticity.  Special emphasis is given to the difficulty of intragranular dislocation generation within the matrix of nanoscaled metals and its implication to slip accommodation processes in current models of superplasticity.  The state of grain boundary structure and the role of grain boundary dislocations in the interface sliding process are examined as the grain size decreases to nanoscale dimensions.  A related aspect is considered, whether an observed increase in superplastic strain rate and/or decrease in superplastic temperature with decreasing grain size are a general phenomenon.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is a renewal proposal designed to gain fundamental understanding of superplasticity in nanocrystalline materials.  The phenomenon of sliding along the grain interfaces is one of the dominant rheological characteristics in superplasticity.  Ultrafine grained nanocrystalline materials contain a large density of interfaces and, therefore, offer a unique opportunity to study the structural state of grain boundaries and their role in superplasticity.\r\n***\r\n",
