 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many students are unsuccessful in developmental mathematics courses.  Among the factors contributing to this lack of success are 1) student belief that mathematics is memorization of formulas and replication of procedures and 2) student unfamiliarity with effective study techniques and helpful learning resources.  This project is developing materials to address both of these problems.  To facilitate conceptual understanding, a collection of mathematics software is being developed for classroom use or individual student use.  Each interactive computer illustration focuses on a single topic from developmental arithmetic, measurement, or metric geometry.  To address the second problem, the developmental mathematics course will be linked to a one-credit course \"Strategies for Student Success\" whose curriculum includes study strategies specifically related to mathematics learning.  In addition to the software tools mentioned above, this project is producing a companion instructors' resource guide and a series of \"Success in Mathematics\" modules.\r\n\r\nThe materials are being developed, tested, and refined over four semesters.  The target audience is developmental mathematics students at two-year institutions. \r\n\r\nThis project is a collaboration between Bunker Hill Community College and the Massachusetts College of Art with Hu Hohn of the Massachusetts College of Art and Joanne Manville of the Bunker Hill Community College Mathematics Department designing and developing the software.\r\n\r\n",
