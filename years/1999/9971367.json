Bruce Hughes\r\n\r\nAbstract: This project applies techniques from controlled topology to solve problems in three broad areas: stratified spaces, nonpositively curved manifolds, and ends of complexes.  An important tool developed previously by the principal investigator is the theory of manifold approximate fibrations.  It will be used to attack several problems.  A stratification presents a decomposition of the space into manifold pieces. Since the space need not be a manifold itself, geometric methods cannot be applied until it is understood how the manifold pieces fit together.  One of the most important aspects of this project is the uncovering of the geometric structure used to join together the manifold pieces. This structure is not only subject to classification and quantification, but can also be applied for the development of new geometric tools for studying stratified spaces. The structure on the neighborhoods of the strata is a bundle theory, namely manifold stratified approximate fibrations, in the category of controlled topology. Thus, controlled topology becomes the vehicle for transforming and applying classical manifold techniques to study these more intricate manifolds with singularities.  In addition to stratified spaces, both manifolds of nonpositive curvature and ends of complexes lead to controlled topology and approximate fibrations. The geometry of nonpositively curved manifolds give boundedness in their universal covers which can then be converted into controlled information. Ends of complexes lead to obstructions for the existence of approximate fibrations near infinity. This is then related to the topology of stratified spaces near the singularities.\r\n\r\nTopology's ultimate goal is to classify manifolds, the spaces which are locally homeomorphic to euclidean spaces.  Controlled topology has become the most powerful new technique toward achieving this goal regarding high-dimensional manifolds since the development of surgery theory.  Even more dramatically, controlled topology is showing its full force in the study of stratified spaces, or manifolds with singularities.  In controlled topology, the objects of study come equipped with a map to a metric space, called the control space. The classical topics of topology (e.g., homotopy equivalences, h-cobordisms, and ends) are studied with sizing estimates measured in the control space (so that classical topology is recovered when the control space is a point).  Problems in many different areas of mathematics lead to questions about manifolds with singularities. It is expected that the research proposed here will give new and useful tools for dealing with such spaces.\r\n",
