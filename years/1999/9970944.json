The aim of this conference is to promote\r\ninteraction between algebraic topology on the one hand and several\r\nextremely active areas of application of topology on the other.  The\r\nareas of application will include differential geometry, moduli spaces,\r\nsymplectic topology, representation theory, and discrete group theory.\r\nThe organizers have in mind interaction in two directions, both\r\napplications of topology to other areas and applications of other\r\nareas of mathematics to topology.  The conference is particularly\r\ntimely, since such interaction is well begun, and they view their role\r\nas encouraging it and helping to broaden and deepen it.  The conference\r\nwill consist entirely of 22 plenary lectures and will permit ample\r\ntime for discussions among participants.  The organizers expect\r\nparticipation by between 75 and 100 mathematicians. They have invited a\r\nnumber of younger mathematicians as well as graduate students, and three\r\nof the featured speakers are women.  A conference proceedings, to be\r\nedited by A. Adem, R. Cohen and G. Carlsson, will be published as a\r\nvolume in Contemporary Mathematics.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
