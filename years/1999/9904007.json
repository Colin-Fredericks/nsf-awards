 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies of the relationship between biodiversity and ecological  functioning suggest that ecosystem processes are influenced by species  diversity.  However, the mechanisms by which species diversity controls  ecological processes remain unclear and untested.  This research will test a mechanistic model relating the species diversity of  ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi to host tree performance based on the  physiology of the associations.\r\n\r\nEctomycorrhizae are symbiotic associations between fungi and the roots of  many forest trees. These fungi greatly enhance nutrient and water uptake by trees.  Despite their ecological importance, there is little information on the role of EM fungal diversity in the functioning of forest ecosystems.  Most physiological studies have been conducted on interactions of single fungal species with single tree species. The PIs propose to investigate the  effect of multiple fungal species on a single tree host.  Because most forests managed for commercial timber production are ectomycorrhizal, understanding the role of EM fungal diversity may be  important for sustainably managing these forests.  Thus, there is a clear need for experimental tests that assess the role of EM fungal diversity in forest ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will test a conceptual model relating changes in EM  fungal diversity to host nutrient uptake and growth.  Assemblages of EM fungi with differing nutrient acquisition capacities will be constructed  on single tree hosts. The model will be tested by: 1) comparing the physiological capacity of a range of EM fungi to acquire inorganic and  organic nutrients in culture and in host association; 2) manipulating EM diversity on individual tree root systems and quantifying tree performance; and 3) measuring host responses to selected two- and four-species EM communities that differ substantially in their nutrient uptake capacities.\r\n\r\nThis research is important for several reasons.  First, understanding the role of a diverse ecological community is needed for developing  appropriate conservation strategies and effective management of the  world's natural resources.  Second, the proposed research will provide the first experimental test of a plausible physiological mechanism for the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function.  Third, loss of, or shifts in, mycorrhizal species diversity due to human activities may have broad implications for ecological functioning.  \r\n",
