 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program, the Principal Investigator and collaborators will bring 30 undergraduate students to Norman, Oklahoma during the late Spring and Summers of 1999 and 2000 to participate in the Oklahoma Weather Center (OWC) REU program.  Each year, ten students will be selected from across the United States to participate in the program.  REU students will conduct research on an atmospheric science topic, under the supervision of mentors at the Weather Center.  In addition to research, the student will participate in field programs, tours of Weather Center facilities, workshops, field trips, and lectures.  These activities are designed to produce a well-rounded summer learning experience.  Student participants will also prepare and present a paper reporting the results of their research to members of the Oklahoma Weather Center Community.  \r\n\r\nHousing, transportation and a modest stipend will be provided to make the program accessible to economically disadvantaged students who must work during summers to support their continuing education.  Special efforts will be made to recruit members of underrepresented groups in science and mathematics (Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and women).  This will be done by actively recruiting students at conferences such as the American Indian Science and Engineering conference and scheduling recruiting visits to some Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Tribal Colleges and Universities.   Notification of the REU program will be given to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities through fliers, brochures, and electronic mail. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the proposed Oklahoma Weather Center REU are:\r\n\r\n1. Recruit and acquire a diverse pool of applications from qualified American undergraduate students who attend colleges and universities across the country\r\n2. Select a diverse, qualified group of undergraduate students to participate in the program\r\n3. Provide a World-class educational research experience for undergraduates under the supervision of dedicated mentors, with access to cutting edge research facilities at the Oklahoma Weather Center\r\n4. Match students with significant research projects that can be completed within a 10 week time frame\r\n5. Evaluate the REU program through the use of student questionnaires, interviews with mentors and comparisons with past OWC REU programs\r\n6. Track student participants for a total of 5 to 10 years after the program\r\n\r\n",
