The focus of his project is the fine structure of determinacy and its metamathematical consequences concerning the Continuum Hypothesis.\r\n\r\n     Is every infinite set of points in the line either countable, i.e., equinumerous with the integers, or else equinumerous with the set of all points in the line?  This is Cantor's continuum problem.  Modern set theory began 35 years ago with P.J. Cohen's proof that Cantor's continuum problem was unsolvable on the basis of the customary axioms of set theory.\r\n\r\n     Axioms of Infinity were proposed by Goedel 50 years ago as candidates for new axioms that solve otherwise unsolvable problems.  The results of 30 years of research have domonstrated that this is true for the classical problems of descriptive set theory.  In particular, the theory of the projective sets (the ``true'' axioms for second order number theory) is now arguably settled.  The nature of Cohen's proof is such that this success cannot be directly repeated for Cantor's continuum problem. Nevertheless, recent results indicate progress can be achieved, for these results suggest a key asymmetry concerning potential solutions to the continuum problem.  The implications of this asymmetry, and the technology behind this discovery, are the main topics for the research to be undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n",
