 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most organisms exhibit temporal organization with respect to the\r\nenvironmental oscillation of day and night and, thus, express diurnal\r\nrhythms.  Many of these rhythms persist in constant conditions, indicating\r\nthat organisms have the capacity to measure time and to use this time\r\ninformation to temporally regulate their biology.  Circadian rhythms are a\r\nsubset of endogenous rhythms with periods of approximately 24 hr that\r\npersist in the absence of environmental time cues.  Increased understanding\r\nof plant responses to environmental input and to endogenous temporal cues\r\nwill have broad agricultural importance for several reasons.  Both\r\nenvironmental cues and the circadian clock contribute to the photoperiodic\r\ndecision to flower, with obvious implications for crop production.\r\nAdditionally, it has become increasingly clear that the circadian clock\r\ngates the responses of plants to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses;\r\nthat is, the response to stresses varies as a function of circadian phase\r\n(time of day).\r\n\r\nCircadian phase is an integral aspect of circadian rhythmicity, yet little\r\nis known of the molecular mechanisms by which phase information is\r\nimparted.  The Arabidopsis CAT2 and CAT3 catalase genes provide molecular\r\nhands of the circadian clock with which to investigate the molecular basis\r\nby which the clock gates gene expression to specific circadian phases.  The\r\ncircadian clock gates mRNA abundance of CAT2and CAT3 to distinct circadian\r\nphases, and each is distinct from the phase of maximal CAB mRNA abundance.\r\nAt least some of the components of the output pathway from the circadian\r\nclock to each of these three genes must, by definition, be distinct.  A\r\nsecond goal is to investigate the interaction between the circadian clock\r\nand light.  Illumination with continuous blue (but not with red) light\r\nallows the detection of circadian oscillations in CAT2 and CAT3 mRNA\r\nabundance.  In addition, there is a role for blue light signaling in the\r\ndamping of CAT3 mRNA oscillations in extended dark.  Ecotype RLD fails to\r\ndamp and apparently carries a mutation that defines a new component of this\r\ndamping pathway.  \r\n\r\nThe specific experimental objectives are:\r\n\r\n1.  The characterization of the cis-acting elements required for CAT\r\nexpression.  A comparison of these morning-specific (CAT2) and\r\nevening-specific (CAT3) genes will allow insight into the mechanisms of\r\nphase determination.  This will entail the construction of series of\r\ntransgenic lines carrying CAT-LUC fusionsin order to define circadian\r\nresponse elements and light response elements controlling CAT expression. \r\n\r\n2.  The characterization of the blue light photoperception system required\r\nfor initiation of circadian oscillation in CAT2 and CAT3 mRNA abundance.\r\nThis will entail the analysis of known mutants with defects in blue light\r\nperception and signaling as well as the identification of novel mutants\r\ndefective in the initiation of circadian oscillations in CAT3-LUC expression.\r\n\r\n3.  The investigation of the mechanism of damping of the circadian\r\noscillations of CAT3 mRNA abundance seen in extended dark.  If the defect\r\nin damping seen in ecotype RLD is inherited in a genetically tractable\r\nfashion, the mutated gene will be cloned and characterized.  New loci\r\nrequired for damping the oscillation in CAT3 mRNA abundance in extended\r\ndark will also be identified.\r\n",
