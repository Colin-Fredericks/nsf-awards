Their basic premise is that the mineralogic and isotopic compositions of the less than 65 micron fraction from glacial marine will allow them to reconstruct the extent of the various ice sheets and their internal dynamics.  \r\n\r\nThe project consists of two main parts.  First, they will determine the isotopic and mineralogic character of fine-grained glacial sediments delivered to the marine environment at various \"point\" sources of icebergs in Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea.  Samples for the point source characterizations exist within their present core and surface sediment sample collections, or are available from the Core Repository Facility at Geological Survey of Canada.  These data are critical for downcore studies of glacial sediment provenance because they will indicate if 1) sediments derived from a given portion of the ice sheets are mineralogically and isotopically distinct, and 2) if each iceberg source has provided isotopically and mineralogically homogeneous sediment.  These characteristics must be established before any attempt to reconstruct ice sheet dynamics from sediment provenance studies can be attempted.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, the Principal Investigators will undertake specific downcore studies on three existing cores to determine changes in sediment provenance, style of deposition, phasing of ice sheet reactions, and ice sheet/ocean interactions.  These cores have been selected along the iceberg transport trajectory and should show increasingly complex mixtures of sediment from different source regions.  The cores selected are from northern Baffin Bay (HU77029-006), from a site east of the mouth of Hudson Strait (HU97048-007), and, south, from Cartwright Saddle on the central Labrador shelf (HU87033-017).  Their analyses will concentrate on H139704S-007 because it is a new core.  They will expand the chronological control by obtaining additional radiocarbon dates and undertake a full suite of sedimentological, foraminiferal, stable isotopic, and provenance studies.  This will enable them to compare data in this core with data from present studies and to compare downcore mineralogic and isotopic variations to those of the glacial \"point\" sources.   This comparison should provide new insights into changes in the extent, configurations, and dynamics of ice sheets around the NW Atlantic over the past 50 thousand years.  \r\n\r\n",
