 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project intends to advance the state of the art in applying parallel computing to branching algorithms. The term \"branching algorithm\" refers to any method built on the basic principle of branch-and-bound search for numerical optimization, including branch-and-bound, branch-and-cut, and branch-and-price methods.\r\n\r\nThe software platform for the work will be PICO, a C++ class library package already being developed in cooperation with Sandia National Laboratories. The main goals for the continued development of PICO are:\r\n\r\nSCALABILITY: the software should scale efficiently up to hundreds or thousands of processors. While systems this large are rare today, and some of the \"hype\" surrounding them has quieted, a robust trend towards greater parallelism continues in the computer hardware industry. The project intends to develop \r\ntechnology that will continue to be useful as systems with more highly parallel CPU's become available.\r\n\r\nSYSTEMS PORTABILITY: the package should be adaptable, by changing its run-time parameter configuration, to varying communication/computation speed ratios. It should be usable on hardware from any vendor offering standard parallel software \r\ntools (C++ and MPI).\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS PORTABILITY: the basic parallel search engine will be applicable to a wide variety of branching algorithms without duplication of the fundamental programming effort. The same core code should be able to manage parallel search applied to any branching algorithm, including relatively advanced methods like \r\nbranch and cut. \r\n\r\nOBJECT ORIENTATION: extensible, object-oriented software design should help achieve the portability goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
