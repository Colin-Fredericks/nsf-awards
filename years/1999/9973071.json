 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates fundamental challenges in creating\r\nmulti-rigid-body simulation environments that have a robust and\r\nrealistic behavior for a large class of configurations and\r\ninteractions. The problem specifically targeted by this proposal is\r\nthe difficulty, due to the apparent lack of solutions of the resulting\r\nmodel, in consistently formulating and efficiently solving the\r\nconstrained Newton laws of mechanics when Coulomb friction is\r\ninvolved.  Recent results, partly developed by the author have shown\r\nthat a well-defined numerical approach is possible in an\r\nimpulse-velocity complementarity formulation. The proposed research\r\naddresses the need to integrate recent developments in the study of\r\nmodels of friction with advanced numerical integration and\r\noptimization techniques.  The complementarity formulation will play a\r\ncentral part in this project but alternative methods will also be\r\nexplored. The algorithms developed will accommodate numerical issues\r\nrarely approached in a complementarity setting such as stiffness and\r\nconstraint drift control. Several specialized optimization methods\r\nwill be designed to address distinguished problems that appear in a\r\nconstrained simulation, such as constraint stabilization in presence\r\nof contact degeneracy.\r\n\r\nThis research will overcome essential difficulties in all areas of\r\ninvestigation that depend on the correct simulation of the motion of\r\nobjects in contact with friction such as robotics, virtual reality,\r\nbiomechanics, manufacturing design.  In all these areas, contact with\r\nfriction is a fundamental component, whether it is related to the user\r\npushing or pulling a stack of virtual objects in frictional contact\r\nwith one another in virtual reality, to a robot grasping and\r\nmanipulating a load, or to the correct simulation of human walking\r\nwhere friction is necessary to prevent slipping.  Yet in spite of the\r\nomni presence of contact and friction in everyday life its simulation\r\nhas proved to be very difficult, partly because of the lack of a\r\nconsistent and efficient theoretical and computational framework. It\r\nis the aim of this proposal to extend the recent results in frictional\r\ncontact modeling in directions that will answer the requirements of\r\nhigh-quality, high-performance multi-rigid-body dynamics simulation for use \r\nin robotics, virtual reality, manufacturing design and other fields.\r\nThis will enable the development of software that will become \r\nan important component of the manufacturing infrastructure of the future.",
