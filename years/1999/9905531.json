The adsorption of surfactant at organic-CO2 and water- CO2  interfaces will be described as a function of the balance between the surfactant's \"CO2-philic\" and \"CO2-phobic\" segments.  Simultaneously, steric stabilization of latexes and emulsions will be controlled by varying the length and degree of solvation of the CO2-philic segment of the surfactant.  The ability to relate interfacial properties and colloid stability to surfactant structure is of vital importance for the rational design of surfactants for these novel colloids in CO2.\r\n\r\nNovel types of diblock or triblock copolymer surfactant structure will be develop to stabilize an organic polymer latex in CO2, which can then be transferred to water form a stable aqueous latex.  In CO2, the CO2-philic segment of the surfactant will provide steric stabilization.  Upon transfer to water, this segment will collapse onto the surface, and another segment will ionize to provide electrostatic stabilization.  The stability of the latex will be related to the adsorption of the surfactant in CO2 and water, the latex particle size, the CO2 density and the surface charge (in water) as a function of pH.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the properties of surfactants at the water-in-CO2 interface will be developed to guide studies of the stability of water-in-CO2 (W/C) and CO2-in-water (C/W) emulsions.  From measurements of the interfacial tension, the point where the \"CO2-philic\" and \"CO2-phobic\" or hydrophilic parts of the surfactant are balanced will be identified.  This balance state will serve as crucial reference point to understand emulsion stability and type (curvature) (W/C or C/W) as a function of surfactant structure, pressure, temperature and salinity. Novel sub-micron emulsions will be formed where the interfacial tension is very low, and then the pressure or temperature will be adjusted to manipulate the stability of the emulsion.\r\n\r\nEmulsions composed of water and CO2 may be utilized for solvent-free coatings, reactions and separations of biomolecules, heterogeneous polymerization, enhanced oil recovery, formation of high surface area material, and cleaning of metals, fabrics, semiconductors, and contaminated soil.  The potential for waste reduction is enormous given that more than 30 billion pounds of organic solvents are used worldwide each year.       \r\n  \r\n",
