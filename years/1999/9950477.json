 "awd_abstract_narration": "To incorporate truly modem NMR techniques into the undergraduate curriculum, the chemistry department is implementing use of the Anasazi \"EFT-60\" Fourier Transform Package. This system allows for collection of proton, C- 13, and 2D spectra, thus allowing for the introduction of the methodology of structural elucidation into the laboratory and classroom experience at a fraction of the cost of super-conducting instruments. \r\n\r\nThe instrument is being used widely by a variety of students all at different levels of chemical literacy.  In Organic and General Chemistry, the students obtain the proton and C- 13 spectra of synthetic products. Using this information in conjunction with FT-IR spectra, students have the necessary tools available to determine product structure, a task difficult without C- 13 data. In a non-traditional approach, the instrument is being integrated into the curriculum of non-science majors from a less rigorous standpoint.\r\n\r\nThe project also is having a regional impact on institutions devoted to secondary education. The college currently serves the needs of forty high school students annually through an outreach program, Exposing pre-college students to modern techniques and instrumentation is motivating students to solve a variety of challenging problems, and perhaps may interest them in the careers available to chemists.\r\n\r\n",
