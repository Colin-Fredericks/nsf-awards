 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to develop a miniaturized biosensor for rapid in vivo determination of Li+ in human body fluids.  The biosensor will be based upon complexation between three independent surface bound crown ethers which will be able to identify and ratio Li+ ions against the common interferant ions Na+, or K+.  Coordination of the ion/s will be detected by Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy. This project will consist of a series of experiments which, if successful, will allow  development of a miniaturized user-friendly, fiber-optic probe to detect a positively charged ion (cation, e.g. Li+) in low concentrations in body fluids. Logical progression will comprise adapting an existing SPRS surface modification technology to the tethering of the ion selective crown ethers for Li+, Na+ and K+. This project will include the synthesis and purification of the crown, 4-aminobenzo-12-crown-4 as this compound is not available commercially.  Further, the chemically modified surfaces will be examined for selectivity against each individual ion and in the presence of a mixture of all three.  Finally, the limits of detection will be addressed. \r\n       A completed miniaturized portable device based on this proposed research will rapidly and reliably detect ionic concentrations/imbalances in human or biological subjects. This device will monitor lithium (Li+) in known bipolar disorder patients under lithium therapy.  In situ rapid detection will minimize clinical laboratory time, increase the \"safety net' against over-medicating, and provide the patient/doctor with instant feedback to determine appropriate dosage.\r\n",
