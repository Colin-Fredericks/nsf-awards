Massive stars play a prominent role in the chemical evolution of our galaxy, as ionizing sources to the interstellar medium, and as important distance standards. Yet little is known about how these stars form because formation occurs hidden within dense molecular clouds.\r\n\r\nA large-scale radio survey at millimeter wavelengths to map out the giant molecular cloud associated with the massive star forming region, M17, will be completed.  The mapping at millimeter wavelengths will unveil approximately a thousand or so dense cores, which represent the early collapse stage of star formation. Sub-millimeter wavelength observations will be obtained on these dense cores to determine the characteristics of this early formation stage.\r\n\r\nThe young massive stars in M17 have been isolated and characterized through previous near-infrared wavelength spectroscopic studies. The previous work revealed an extraordinarily young cluster of very massive stars; many too heavily shrouded to be directly detected, even at 2-micron wavelength.  In order to investigate the physical conditions existing within the cloud, which lead to the very recent formation of the massive stars detected in the near-infrared, and to look toward earlier stages of massive star formation, observations at sub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths are now required. The millimeter and sub-millimeter investigations are an integral piece of a larger scientific endeavor to delineate the evolutionary steps in the formation of massive stars. Such a holistic investigation, which includes observations of young massive stars, massive young stellar objects, and dense molecular core properties, has never been previously applied to a massive star-forming region.\r\n\r\nA vital collaboration with the University of Arizona will allow guaranteed access to the Heinrich Hertz Sub-millimeter Telescope (HHT) to carry out observations, as well as visitor access to apply for observing time on all telescopes operated by Steward Observatory of the University of Arizona. \r\n\r\nThis award is supported by funds from the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\n",
