 "awd_abstract_narration": "One important way in which cells communicate in order to influence each other's behavior, metabolism or gene expression, is via receptor-mediated signaling.  This kind of communication is critical for the proper coordination of cellular functions within an organism or within a population of cells.  However, when one cell type produces a \"signal\" intended to interact with a specific target cell type, it is important not only for the target cell to be able to interpret and respond to the signal, but also, it is important for the target cell to be able to shut down its own responsiveness once the response is underway, in order to maintain the proper quantitative level of response.  For signals that are received by target cells via receptor-mediated signaling, target cells generally down-regulate their responsiveness to the signal by removing the receptor from its cell surface.  This is usually accomplished by internalizing the receptor via endocytosis.  Some of the membrane proteins that are internalized by endocytosis are then sorted to lysosomes for degradation, while others are not fated for degradation and are instead recycled back to the plasma membrane.  The long-term goal of this project is to understand, at the molecular level, how cells are able to sort specific plasma membrane proteins selectively and efficiently to lysosomes following internalization.  This work has significance for all aspects of organismal homeostasis.\r\n\r\nThe model protein for these studies is P-selectin, a cell adhesion protein involved in inflammation.  P-selectin is rapidly internalized, then sorted constitutively in early endosomes from recycling membrane proteins and rapidly degraded in lysosomes.  This attenuates the activity of P-selectin in the inflammatory response.  The cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin contains a sorting determinant that is necessary and sufficient to drive this sorting event.  This sorting determinant is recognized in several cell types that do not normally express P-selectin, suggesting that the sorting machinery is ubiquitous, and serves a general function in the endocytic pathway.  Part of this function may be to limit the activity of many types of membrane proteins by targeting them to lysosomes for degradation.  The relative simplicity of the P-selectin system offers important advantages as an experimental model for endosomal sorting.  It is very likely that information gained from studying endosomal sorting of P-selectin will be widely applicable to other membrane proteins, including growth factor receptors.  \r\n\r\nThe specific aims of this project are: 1, to directly measure the sorting of P-selectin and other membrane proteins away from recycling receptors in early endosomes; 2, identify candidate endosomal sorting machinery proteins that interact specifically with the endosomal sorting determinant in P-selectin; and 3, reconstitute early endosomal sorting in permeabilized cells to study the molecular basis of this process in detail.  To measure early endosomal sorting, carrier vesicles derived from early endosomes will be accumulated in living cells, then separated from endosomes by subcellular fractionation.  Pulse-chase labeling of cell surface proteins will be employed to measure quantitatively the delivery of P-selectin and other membrane proteins into the carrier vesicle fraction.   Affinity chromatography on GST fusion proteins is being used to determine whether any known sorting proteins interact with the endosomal sorting determinant of P-selectin.  Yeast two-hybrid screening will also be pursued to identify proteins that interact specifically with P-selectin.  Reconstitution of the sorting event will be pursued using Streptolysin O to gain access to the cytoplasmic compartment.  A point mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of P-selectin that abrogates endosomal sorting, identified through earlier mutagenesis studies, will be employed as a negative control, both for the cell fractionation experiments and interaction assays. \r\n\r\n",
