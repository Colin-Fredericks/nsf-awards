 "awd_abstract_narration": "9861201\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed at the development of improved membranes for separations in the chemical process industry (CPI). Conventional membrane processes, despite their potential efficiency, cannot address many key CPI separations.  This is because membranes and modules cannot maintain selectivity when operating on multi-component feed streams nor withstand exposure to common feed-stream components and operating conditions.  The goal of this program is to develop a new hybrid polymeric material for membrane coatings that will retain high selectivity when operating on multi-component feed streams that would swell conventional materials and lead to a loss in selectivity. The coatings based on this new hybrid material will be applied to unique solvent-resistant and temperature-resistant hollow-fiber supports and used in high-efficiency modules.  In this Phase I program, feasibility will be demonstrated by developing coatings for two classes of industrially important organic/organic separations: aromatics from aliphatics and olefins from paraffins. The best coatings will be applied to solvent-resistant and temperature-resistant hollow-fiber supports and their performance demonstrated.\r\n     The hybrid coating material could be used to prepare coatings for a broad range of organic/organic separations important in the CPI. Initially, two key separations will be examined: toluene from heptane and propylene from propane.\r\n",
