Motivated by\r\nexamples from geometry and physics, the investigator will study\r\ninfinite dimensional complex manifolds, especially the\r\ninhomogeneous Cauchy--Riemann equations on such manifolds, a\r\nsystem of differential equations relevant to a host of geometrical\r\nand analytical problems.  If the program is successful, it may\r\nlead to extensions of the Newlander--Nirenberg theorem concerning\r\nthe very definition of complex manifolds.  There are very few\r\nmethods to deal with complex analysis in an infinite dimensional\r\nsetting and one of the aims of this research will be to invent the\r\nnecessary tools.  The other topic concerns embeddability of\r\nCauchy--Riemann manifolds.  This research will focus on compact,\r\nstrongly pseudoconvex Cauchy--Riemann manifolds of dimension 3,\r\nwhich is the hardest dimension for the subject.  We will study how\r\nthe size of the space of Cauchy--Riemann functions is influenced\r\nby the geometry of the manifold itself, or by the geometry of\r\ncomplex and almost complex manifolds spanned by the manifold.\r\nAnother aspect is related to discrete group actions on balls.  The\r\ntools are from elliptic partial differential equations, geometry\r\nand possibly algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nThe main subjects of this research are functions of several,\r\npossibly infinitely many variables. Such functions arise in the\r\nstudy of complicated systems that can be described by a number of\r\nparameters. For example the position of a space exploring rocket\r\nis described by three numbers, the coordinates; the rocket might\r\nbe spinning, in which case the speed by which it spins is also a\r\nparameter, and so on. Other quantities may be determined by these\r\nparameters, e.g. the necessary intensity of a radio signal to\r\nreach the rocket: they are functions of the parameters. In\r\naddition to the above so called internal parameters, there are\r\nalso external parameters determined once the system is\r\nconstructed, e.g. its weight. This research investigates how\r\ncertain functions vary as parameters (internal, or external) are\r\nallowed to change a little; and also how understanding \"little\" or\r\neven infinitesimal variations helps in understanding large\r\nvariations. Two specifics of this project are worth mentioning. We\r\nwill focus on parameters that are complex rather than real\r\nnumbers---despite its counterintuitive nature, this assumption has\r\npractical value.  Also, part of this project treats functions of\r\ninfinitely many parameters.  Whether such systems exist in nature\r\nis up for debate, but undoubtedly they represent approximations to\r\nsystems with a huge number of parameters, which do exist.\r\n",
