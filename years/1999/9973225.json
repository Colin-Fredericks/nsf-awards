There is also an international component with Croatia funded by the International division.  The grant supports theoretical and computational studies of several effects that are not included in the standard Migdal-Eliashberg treatment of electron-phonon superconductivity.  A combination of first-principles electronic structure calculations and many-body theoretical techniques will be used to study these effects in real materials.  The work will help elucidate how and when the conventional theory of electron-phonon superconductors breaks down in real materials, and will contribute to development of better methods for understanding the properties of superconducting materials.\r\n\r\nThis grant is to support research of two young faculty with complementary interests and expertise in the theory of superconductivity. The grant is funded jointly by the Divison of Materials Research and the International division.  A major difference between the conventional superconductors and essentially all of the ones that have been discovered recently (doped fullerenes, high Tc materials) is that the theoretical framework, so successful in superconductivity in conventional materials, cannot be applied to the new materials. This project will  analyze difficulties and find solutions for them. \r\n\r\n",
