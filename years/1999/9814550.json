 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the establishment of an archive and data distribution system for glaciological and cryospheric data from the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP).  The archive would create a permanent record for upcoming and past field data and would ensure the availability of older data as programs from previous years come to an end or as P.I.s retire.  The Antarctic Glaciological Data Center (AGDC) would be modeled on the current Arctic System Science (ARCSS) data management program at NSIDC, which has been a demonstrated success over the last eight years, and would be a logical extension of NSIDC's role as the U.S. Antarctic Data Coordination Center (ADCC), which provides data set information on the spectrum of USAP research activities.  The presence of a data center removes the burden of archiving and distributing data from P.I.s- a burden they retain under the currently-funded ADCC.  A data protocol would be developed in concert with key USAP inititatives like the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) program and the U.S. component of the International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (US ITASE) to ensure eventual broad access to their data, while including an appropriate period during which P.I.s would have exclusive use of the data.  Examples of the types of data that would be collected and archived include physical and geochemical data from ice cores and snow pits, ice surface elevations, internal layer records, ice thickness and bedrock topography from radar profiles, snow accumulation, grain-size, ablbedo, surface and 10-meter snow temperatures, ice velocity measurements from remote sensing imagery, field survey data and well-characterized digital seismic and radar profile data.  The fundamental purpose of the proposed effort is to provide a simple, coordinated, and appropriate means of facilitating the broadest possible utilization of glaciological and related data collected by the USAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
