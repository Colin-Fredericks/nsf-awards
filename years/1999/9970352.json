Among the principal topics to be investigated are: (1) multiparameter Hardy spaces within the Heisenberg group and stratified groups; (2) CR-Yamabe problems on the Heisenberg group and Sobolev inequalities with optimal constants, including the classification of positive solutions and symmetry problems; (3) nonisotropic Sobolev spaces on the Heisenberg group and stratified groups and their generalizations to metric spaces (high order Sobolev spaces on metric spaces are fundamental to doing potential theory in non-Euclidean settings such as Riemannian manifolds and fractals); (4) Calderon-Zygmund  estimates for Schrodinger operators and their applications to nonlinear partial differential equations; (5) covering lemmas and their applications to partial differential equations and geometric analysis.\r\n\r\nProjects conducted here cover many topics of current interest, most of them falling under the broad umbrella of \"harmonic analysis\" and approachable using modern variants of the classical tools of that subject. The quantitative and qualitative study of partial differential equations, one of the principal focal points of the project, constitutes a large part of the mathematical modeling of the physical world. Solutions of such equations have important applications in the physical sciences, the life sciences, engineering, and economics. In particular, they have applications to control theory and dynamical systems (e.g., the motion of objects in space under the influence of gravitational and other forces). Results obtained through the research proposed here could help to uncover new properties of solutions of partial differential equations, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the physical processes with which these equations are associated. \r\n\r\n",
