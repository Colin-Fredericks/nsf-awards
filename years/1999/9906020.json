 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workshop on the integration of Modeling and Control for Automotive Systems\r\n\r\nIn the last two decades control had had an undeniable impact on the improvement of automotive systems.  Contol algorithms have aided the sutopmation of the manufacturing processes thereby reducing cost and increasing cycle time.  They have been the enabling technology in reducing emissions, thus, having a tremendous environmental impact on society.  Controls have enabled automotibe manufacturers to provide customers with significant performance and safety improvements at reasonable costs.  As automotibe systems become a challenging task.  The lack of data, the interdisciplinary nature, and the existence of multiple layers of modeling and ocntroller details (all the way form distributed todiscrete event systems)  make the integration of modeling and control a critical step towards system development.\r\n\r\nThe current control analysis and synthesis approach can be made to perform in a satisfactory manner on a case by case basis.  The success of these approaches is usually directly linked to the resident engineerig expertise and experience available.  However, good engineering judgement shoudl be aided by system theoretic concepts and we would like to consider more broadly the question of a seamless integration between modeling and control design.  This workship will consider  specific examples of control problems, spanning severl area of automotive systems, which require different levels of modeling accuracy and abstraction: 1) Engine and Powertrain Control 2) Vehivle Dynamics and Control and 3) Fault detectionk, diagnostics and monitoring and 4) Large Scale systems.",
