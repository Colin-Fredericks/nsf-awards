 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores molecular structure-property relationships of electron transfer rates in dendritic structures.  These structures encompass a redox-active core around which is arrayed a dendritic structure.  Rationally designed modifications of this structure will make possible the use of new techniques for characterizing electron transfer.  Such variations as a hydrophilic and metallaphilic surfaces will be explored to this end.  In addition, changes in the structure of the dendritic core as a function of internal steric forces will be investigated and its effect on electron transfer elucidated.  Modulation of electron transfer in these systems has relevance to the areas of molecular electronic devices and metallaproteins.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Christopher B. Gorman of North Carolina State University.  Professor Gorman explores the properties of man-made substances that incorporate an electrically active core surrounded by a shell of varying composition and thickness, finally covered by a skin having specific properties such as electrical conductivity or water solubility.  The electronic properties of such structures is of interest and has potential applications in the area of electronics as well as being analogous to biological structures called enzymes.",
