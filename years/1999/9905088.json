El-Naggar, Department of Electrical Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio and Dr. Mohamed S. El-Sherif, Head of the Computer Systems Department, the Electronics Research Institute, Cairo, Egypt. They plan to explore innovative techniques in the design components of a mobile communication device using very large scale integration (VLSI) technologies.  They seek to achieve higher levels of integration in complemetary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS) technology, develop multi-standard operation coupled with a wider domain of services, and low voltage, low power designs. \r\n\r\nScope: The US team, which is led by Dr. El-Naggar, is an expert analog and radio frequency (RF) team.  They have experience in RF design, especially for low-voltage low-power applications such as mobile communications.  The team led by Dr. El-Sherif has the system know-how in designing components for communications systems.  The proposed activities could lead to development of low-cost long-life components for mobile communications equipment.  Mobile communications are gaining wide acceptance in many developing countries where fixed equipment for conventional wire communications is deficient.  The project is of great potential to Egypt and is also of benefit to the United States because of its large communications equipment manufacturing industry.  A graduate student at Ohio State University will participate in the research, gaining experience in an international  science activity.  This proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities. \r\n",
