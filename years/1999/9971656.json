 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of our research is to develop and apply new mathematical\r\nmethods for constructing solutions to difference, differential-difference,\r\nintegral, and integro- differential equations.  These asymptotic and\r\nsingular perturbation techniques are based on the WKB method, boundary\r\nlayer analysis and matched asymptotic expansions.  New nontrivial\r\nextensions of these methods have previously been developed to solve\r\nproblems in a wide variety of applications, which led to remarkably\r\naccurate results.  We plan to continue the development of these methods,\r\nand to apply them in particular to models arising in the performance\r\nevaluation of queueing systems.  Several aspects of the project are\r\ndirectly related to problems arising in the analysis of high-speed\r\ncommunication systems.  We also propose to study problems in mathematical\r\nphysics, related to diffusion-convection, bifurcation, and tunneling\r\nthrough potential barriers.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect of our research program is the study of queues or\r\nlines.  In its simplest form, a queueing system consists of a server and a\r\nqueue or waiting room.  Customers arrive, possibly at random times, and\r\nrequest service of random length from the server.  If the system is empty,\r\nan arriving customer is sent directly to the server.  Otherwise, the\r\ncustomer is relegated to wait in the queue.  One is interested in\r\ndeveloping mathematical models of the queueing system and computing\r\nperformance measures, such as the average number of customers waiting, the\r\naverage waiting time, the utilization, etc., to help understand the\r\nbehavior of the system.  For complicated queueing systems, the performance\r\nmeasures are difficult to compute and a major goal of our research is to\r\nconstruct useful approximations to them.  The main application of our work\r\nin queueing is to high-speed communication networks such as the Internet.  \r\nHere the customers are packets of information (bits), such as data files,\r\nvoice messages, or video.  The server is hardware such as a router or\r\nswitch, which transmits the packets along the Internet.  At each switch,\r\nthe packets are stored in a queue, if needed, before transmission.  These\r\nbuffers can only a fixed number of packets.  Arrivals finding a full\r\nbuffer are lost and hence the system performance is degraded.  The\r\nperformance measures, average buffer size, average packet delays, and the\r\nprobability of losing information, is important in the design and tuning\r\nof high-speed communication networks.  Our research provides network\r\ndesigners with mathematical tools for approximating these performance\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
