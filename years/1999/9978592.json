 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nation's civil infrastructure consists of, among other things, buildings,\r\nroads, bridges, and utilities. These infrastructure components are integrally\r\nlinked to our society and our environment. Increasingly, we are relying on\r\ncomputer tools and databases for information about our infrastructure to enable\r\nus to better develop, use, and maintain it. On an ongoing basis we are creating\r\ninfrastructure information management systems (IIMS), even though we often do\r\nnot refer to them as such. Two key data items in any infrastructure information\r\nmanagement system include (1) location of a component and (2) the resulting\r\nspatial relationships among components that result from their locations.\r\nAdditionally, attribute data items describe the characteristics of the\r\ncomponents themselves.\r\n\r\nA number of computer tools have emerged that are useful in the realm of\r\ninfrastructure information management. Prominent among these are geographic\r\ninformation systems (GIS) and database management systems (DBMS). Historically,\r\nGIS systems have been optimized to store, manage, and process graphical spatial\r\ndata and DBMS systems have been optimized to store and process tabular\r\nattribute data.\r\n\r\nTo gain additional IIMS functionality and to support more useful analysis, we\r\npropose to investigate linkages between spatial and attribute information. Such\r\ntools or capabilities would improve infrastructurerelated problem analysis as\r\nwell. The key problem, even with recent DBMS/GIS linkage advances, is that\r\nthere are no fundamental models and algorithms to give users, analysts, and\r\ndecision makers information about the quality and accuracy of the data being\r\nprovided, analyzed, and used. This critical shortcoming is the topic of this\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nWe propose to develop (1) conceptual models and algorithms for assessing and\r\nquantifying positional-data error and (2) methodologies for performing\r\ntransformations between different location referencing systems. We will test\r\nthe models, algorithms, and methodologies using transportation case studies.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project can be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. To identify the positional-data quality needs of common transportation\r\napplications (application assessment).\r\n\r\n2. To identify the delivered level of accuracy attainable by various scientific\r\nlocation measurement instruments and technologies (accuracy of technologies).\r\n\r\n3. To develop models for relating needed and delivered accuracy levels\r\n(relationship models).\r\n\r\n4. To develop models and algorithms for quantifying and qualifying spatial data\r\naccuracy (accuracy models).\r\n\r\n5. To develop methodologies for assessing the impacts of positional-data\r\naccuracy in translations between measurement techniques and spatial referencing\r\nsystems (translations).\r\n\r\nMeeting these objectives will have the following significant project outcomes. \r\nWe will better understand the relationship between the data accuracy needs of\r\nusers and applications on one hand, and data accuracy levels of measurement\r\ntechnologies on the other.  We will be able to reduce the level of uncertainty\r\nin transportation (and infrastructure) decision making.  We will be able to use\r\ngreater accuracy to improve reliability, functionality, utility, and safety of\r\ntransportation (and infrastructure) systems.  The models and algorithms can be\r\nused to develop new tools, or enhancements to existing tools, to improve\r\nspatial data representation, understanding, analysis, and processing.",
