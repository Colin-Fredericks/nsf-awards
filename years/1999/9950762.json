 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tennessee Technological University (TTU) has developed and implemented a multimedia software package, entitled The Homework Laboratory, which is designed to increase student understanding and retention while saving the instructor time in terms of grading and coaching. The Homework Laboratory is a new approach to engineering education which: (1) randomizes the variables for a student's homework so that each problem is different for every student; (2) scores each homework problem; (3) coaches the student as necessary; and (4) averages the scores for the professor at the end of the semester. The software is also capable of scoring and assisting with unassigned textbook problems for practice or creating randomized and timed practice tests.\r\n\r\nThe Homework Laboratory is being used in engineering mechanics classes at TTU and appears to enhance student understanding and exam preparedness. TTU has formed a partnership with the University of Texas at Austin (UT) and Addison Wesley Longman Publishing, Inc. for: (1) implementing the software in 24 engineering mechanics classes at the University and UT via CD-ROM and campus network; (2) evaluating the effectiveness of the concept at improving student comprehension and retention;  (3) modifying The Homework Laboratory approach based on the evaluation findings; and (4) implementing the software over the internet.\r\n\r\nIn addition, The Homework Laboratory has potential for improving instruction in grades K-12.  It is being modified by a group of pre-service K-12 teachers who are students at TTU.  They are adapting it for use with a physical science textbook that  has been adopted in grades 8 and 9 in Tennessee.  The materials are being field tested by the TTU pre-service teachers, who are working towards licensure.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
