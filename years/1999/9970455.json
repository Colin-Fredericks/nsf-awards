 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the use of differences to obtain new estimates for the  number of lattice points close to a smooth curve, and for the number of  lattice points close to a smooth surface. The principal investigator has  several specific problems on which he will apply the methods. These problems include questions about the distribution of squarefull numbers, cubefull  numbers, almost prime numbers, and B-free numbers. Another research topic of the project is to extend the current difference approaches to algebraic number fields.\r\n\r\nThis research is in the general field of number theory although techniques  from approximation theory and combinatorics are essential ingredients.  Number theory starts with the whole numbers and questions about the  divisibility of one whole number by another. It is among the oldest  branches of mathematics and was pursued for many centuries for purely  aesthetic reasons. However, within the last half century it has become an  indispensable tool with diverse applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and communication systems. \r\n\r\n",
