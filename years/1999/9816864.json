 "awd_abstract_narration": "In contrast to animals which usually have two sexes, male and female, a number of reproductive strategies coexist in the higher plants. The majority of higher plants are hermaphrodites which can reproduce by self-fertilization, but some have evolved means to favor outcrossing. The moneoecious and dioecious species produce male and female flowers instead of hermaphroditic flowers. In dioecious plant species, individuals produce either only male or only female flowers. Genetic differences distinguish the sexes and structurally distinct sex chromosomes control sexual differentiation in several dioecious species. Because plant species with divergent reproductive strategies are often closely related, even within the same genus, the evolutionary changes required to evolve a new reproductive strategy can be studied by comparison of gender determination mechanisms in closely related plant species. The evolutionary strategy used by the plant genus Silene will be investigated by comparison of the organization of chromosomes in species with different sexual modes. Silene is an excellent model for studies of the evolution of reproductive strategy because it includes species that are true hermaphrodites, gynodioecious (hermaphroditic and female individuals coexist) or dioecious (males and females coexist). Phylogenetic studies indicate that the Silene evolved from a gynodioecious population. However, truly hermaphroditic species are found in at least two distinct sections and closely related dioecious species exist in two other sections, the Elisanthe and the Otites. Dioecious species in both sections have sex chromosomes. Because all Silene species have 2n = 24 chromosomes, the sex chromosomes of each dioecious species most likely evolved from an autosome pair. However, both molecularly and morphologically based phylogenies indicate that the Otites and the Eilsanthe diverged independently. Thus their sex chromosomes may have evolved from different autosome pairs. Comparison of chromosome structure in plants of this genus provides a unique opportunity to identify the evolutionary changes that lead to a switch in reproductive strategy and the evolution of sex chromosomes.  The major goals of this research are: 1) Compare the positions of low copy sequences linked to the Lisene latifolia Y chromosome to the positions of homologous sequences on the chromosomes of a broadly distributed sample of other Silene species 2) Identify additional sex chromosome-linked makers to extend the comparison of chromosomal positions 3) Use FISH to characterize Y-linked sequences deleted in sex determination mutants of S. latifolia and 4) Identify sex chromosomes of S. otites and compare gene organization of those chromosomes to the sex chromosomes of S. latifolia.\r\n\r\nThese studies will lay the groundwork for a molecular characterization of evolution of sex chromosomes in plants. The results can be compared to data available on evolution of sex chromosomes in Drosophila and mammals in order to reveal the general constraints that guide the evolution of sex chromosomes. \r\n",
