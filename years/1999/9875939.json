 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Golgi apparatus is organized into stacks of membrane-enclosed cisternae, but the processes that generate this remarkable structure are still poorly understood. Conventional models represent the Golgi as a series of stable, well-defined subcompartments. However, emerging data favor a 'cisternal maturation' model that views the Golgi not as an independent organelle, but as a dynamic outgrowth of the endoplasmic reticulum. Golgi cisternae are postulated to form de novo by the fusion of ER-derived vesicles, which are produced at specialized subdomains called transitional ER (tER) sites.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to understand the processes that create tER sites and Golgi stacks. As part of this effort, the current proposal focuses on characterizing the mechanisms that mediate reorganization of the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi of vertebrate cells undergoes dramatic rearrangements under certain conditions, including depolymerization of microtubules and passage of the cells through mitosis. Based on the cisternal maturation model, it seems plausible that some of these reorganization events involve the transit of Golgi components through the ER, followed by the emergence of new Golgi structures next to tER sites. This hypothesis will be tested by a combination of biochemical assays and fluorescence microscopy studies.\r\n\r\nThe research portion of this proposal has two Specific Aims:\r\n\r\n1. TO DEVELOP A BIOCHEMICAL ASSAY THAT WILL REVEAL WHETHER GOLGI PROTEINS TRANSIT THROUGH THE ER DURING GOLGI REORGANIZATION. Transit through the ER will be detected by the action of ER-localized glucosidases. These glucosidases will initially be blocked with specific inhibitors, thereby loading the Golgi with proteins that contain glucosylated oligosaccharides. After removal of the inhibitor, Golgi reorganization will be induced, and then Golgi proteins will be analyzed for the presence or absence of glucose residues.\r\n2. TO ANALYZE THE LINK BETWEEN tER FUNCTION AND GOLGI REORGANIZATION USING FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY. The cisternal maturation model predicts that the distribution and activity of tER sites will influence Golgi reorganization. This prediction will be tested using fluorescence microscopy. For example, if a drug treatment initially causes Golgi proteins to return to the ER, the reorganized Golgi structures should be found near tER sites. To examine the dynamics of tER sites, these sites will be labeled with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fusion construct.\r\n\r\nThese experiments will synergize with ongoing analysis of budding yeasts in the Glick laboratory. By elucidating conserved aspects of the tER-Golgi system, these studies aim to provide a unified molecular description of Golgi stack formation.\r\n\r\nThis research plan is closely integrated with Dr. Glick's CAREER education objectives. In his undergraduate and graduate cell biology classes, the Golgi serves as a useful example for illustrating three key lessons: 1, cell biological processes are best understood by synthesizing data from diverse model organisms; 2, cells were designed not by a logical engineer, but by an opportunistic evolution; and 3, one must always be willing to reconsider basic assumptions.  More generally, a recurring theme from Dr. Glick's explorations of the Golgi is the importance of viewing each question from multiple perspectives. This point is emphasized strongly in Dr. Glick's teaching, which focuses on developing students' capacity for critical thinking. In turn, the exercise of formulating and presenting these insights stimulates the teacher's own thinking about research-related questions.\r\n",
