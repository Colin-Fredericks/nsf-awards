 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite changes in regulatory policy and the emergence of new technology options, considerable uncertainty remains surrounding deployment of broadband technology for the last mile, the link to the home and small businesses.  Progress has been slow, raising questions about what research, policies, and strategies would accelerate deployment and increase broadband access availability.  This study examining last mile issues will explore possible scenarios and analyze the relationships among technology options, policy approaches and business models.  This analysis will be valuable to those charged with setting policy, including the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and local and state regulatory entities.  The FCC is currently in the midst of implementing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and facing considerable pressure and criticism; state public utility commissions are literally closer to the consequences of deployment decisions.  The study will provide insights to Congress and others evaluating the success of the 1996 Act in fostering innovative, competitive services for local access.  It will also help consumers and public interest groups understand and evaluate current and future technology options.  Given the uncertainty about which technologies, regulatory approaches, and business models are likely to prevail, industry also stands to benefit from an objective analysis across these dimensions.  This project will be distinguished by its integration of technical insights with policy and business perspectives.",
