 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Women in Mathematics will continue the program of\r\nawarding travel support for women mathematicians to attend domestic or\r\nforeign research conferences. The proposed level of funding will allow\r\napproximately 75 grants, in amounts from $250 to $1,500, to be awarded\r\nover a three year period.\r\n\r\nAdditional funds are requested to establish a pilot program of awards\r\nto women mathematicians for travel, to work with particular\r\nindividuals in their research area for brief periods of time. The\r\nproposed level of funding for these mentoring travel grants would\r\nallow three to six grants per year of $4000 each over a period of 3\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBoth programs are intended to enhance the research capability and the\r\nvisibility of women mathematicians, to expand the influence of their\r\nwork, and to increase their ability to inspire women at less advanced\r\nlevels to pursue (or continue) careers in mathematics, in the\r\nsciences, or in other fields requiring substantial mathematical\r\ntraining. Both programs seek (directly or indirectly) to make the\r\npresence of women at places where research is being reported or done a\r\nnormal professional expectation, and to mitigate the persistant\r\nproblem of having too few women speakers at many mathematical\r\nconferences. Both programs should be important tools for the retention\r\nof women mathematicians in academic life. To assess the impact of this\r\nprogram, and to see if there are ways the program could be improved, a\r\nstudy will be taken of the effectiveness of past NSF grants to AWM for\r\ntravel grants.",
