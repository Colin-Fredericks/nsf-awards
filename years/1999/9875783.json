 "awd_abstract_narration": "9875783 John Chapin\r\nThis is a project to build tools for the dynamic analysis of parallel servers, and to develop educational techniques for improving the teaching of dynamic analysis skills. Parallel servers include operating systems, web servers, and other applications which must run forever and respond to multiple requests in parallel. Parallel servers are difficult to test and debug using current approaches due to their inherent nondeterminism.  Better dynamic analysis tools are a critical step towards improving the reliability of this important class of programs. The core technology developed in this project is a Java virtual machine specifically designed so that tools can easily monitor and control the execution of Java programs. A hypothesis of the project is that the use of such a tool platform will significantly simplify the construction of analysis tools. The project is building three major tools. A bidirectional debugger provides reverse in addition to forward execution commands. An exhaustive-search tester supports thorough analysis of timing-dependent behaviors. An exploratory modeling tool automates the documentation and checking of the developer's evolving understanding of program behavior. These tools will be deployed in undergraduate classes and integrated into curricular materials developed to help teach dynamic analysis techniques.\r\n",
