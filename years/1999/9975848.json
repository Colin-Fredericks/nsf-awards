 "awd_abstract_narration": "9975848\r\nTaya\r\n\r\nThis award will provide partial support for the development of a new experimental capability necessary for the experimental study of a new class of smart magnetic materials that exhibit coupling among the mechanical, thermal and magnetic behavior: magnetostrictive alloys, magnetostrictive alloy fiber and particulate actuated polymer matrix composites and homogeneous ferromagnetic shape memory alloys and their composites.  These magnetic smart materials are increasingly important, as they constitute a key actuator element for smart devices and structures thanks to their fast and powerful response at the time of actuation.  Accurate characterization of these magnetic smart materials will provide precise data for the constitutive equations of the materials, which will be used by the engineers designing such smart devices.\r\n\r\nThe testing system will allow testing under a very broad range of magnetro-thermo-mechanical loading.  For instance, it will be possible to perform constant stress - increasing magnetic field or constant magnetic field - increasing applied stress and magnetization experiments in which the stress and field axes are parallel or orthogonal to one another.  Finally, the electromagnet may be used separately for the measurement of magnetic properties at constant temperature and stress free hysteresis behaviors.  The instrument will be used for short, intermediate to long-term purposes.  The short to intermediate term purpose includes use of the instrument to characterize the magnetoelastic properties of the ferromagnetic shape memory alloys under magneto-thermo-mechanical loading, as a part of the current research project, design of shape memory alloys for actuator system of helicopter blades, in collaboration with aerospace companies.  For the intermediate to long-term purpose, the proposed instrument will be used for characterization of the ferromagnetic SMAs with transformation temperatures close to a human body temperature with applications to biomedical implant devices.  Students and faculty engineers at several local companies, at the University of Washington, and researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST), Boulder, Colorado will use the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe instrument will also be used for undergraduate education allowing a new course in magneto-rheological design to be developed, and magnetic modules to be added to existing materials science courses. \r\n%%%\r\nThe developed facility will significantly enhance the research capabilities and collaborative interactions of faculty and students at the University of Washington the private sector, and a Federal government laboratory.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
