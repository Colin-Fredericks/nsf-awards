Assembly will be pursued by the adaptation of crystal engineering techniques to semiconductor clusters (< 3 nm) using site-specific modification of the cluster edges with self-assembling organic linkers. The final structure is a 3 dimensional diamandoid architecture composed of adamantanoid semiconductor clusters linked at the apex of the tetrahedral structures. Choice of the spacer and choice of the semiconductor cluster size can systematically tune the level of electronic coupling. Studies will be conducted to understand fundamental ways to systematically modify and network nano-clusters into a 3-dimensional structures. The approach to address these issues is to probe the synthetic preparation, ligand substitution and capping influence on Cd and Zn chalcogenide clusters consisting of variable core structures. Metallo-thiolates are structural analogs of adamantane and can be used to produce diamond lattices. Application of mass-spectroscopic techniques will be used for determination of the parent cluster purity, as well as directly addressing stability of cluster materials. Information on exchange dynamics in these materials will be probed by comparison of Raman and NMR data for the substituted clusters. Exploitation of tectonic approaches for self-assembling nano-materials using polymeric connectors will be pursued for applications in the assembly of compliant electronic materials. Materials assembled from polymeric spacers are inherently flexible. The flexibility can be utilized to control coupling in the lattice potentially allowing a new path for propagating information via lattice modulation rather than conventional electronic biasing. Development of such materials requires focus on both molecular scale assemblies of nanoscale materials and the characterization of electronic transport phenomena.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science, chemistry, and engineering knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic materials. The scope of the project will expose students to challenges in materials synthesis, processing, and characterization. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and education.\r\n***\r\n9875940\r\nStrouse\r\nThe goal of this CAREER project is two-fold: 1)to develop synthetic methodologies to allow the systematic assembly of II-VI nano-scale semiconductors into periodic electronic networks; 2)to study the electronic coupling between components of the array.
