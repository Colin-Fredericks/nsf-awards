Such\r\nsystems are comprised of many relatively simple elements that\r\noperate without central direction.  Examples are metabolic\r\nsystems, ant colonies, distributed computer architectures, and\r\nthe immune system.  Emphasis is put on the immune system, because\r\nof its great intrinsic interest, its importance in health and\r\ndisease, and the massive (but incomplete) detail known concerning\r\nthe operation of its trillions of cells.  Leading theorists and\r\nexperimentalists in immunology present a distillation of present\r\nday experimental knowledge together with mathematical and\r\ncomputer models based on this knowledge.  These experts seek to\r\nformulate general principles that apply not only to the immune\r\nsystem but also to the other distributed autonomous systems that\r\nare under study.  Experts on the other systems report on their\r\nspecialties and also try to distill principles that are broadly\r\napplicable.  Half the participants are graduate students and\r\npostdocs, who can adopt the novel views expressed in their future\r\nresearch.\r\n     This meeting is concerned with the study of systems that can\r\naccomplish a variety of complex tasks with a large leaderless\r\ngroup of relatively primitive components.  The major example to be\r\nstudied is the immune system, with its trillions of cells and\r\nhundreds of signaling chemicals.  Experimentalists and theorists\r\nreport on advances in understanding how the immune system can so\r\nexpertly perform a spectrum of tasks such as killing the large\r\nvariety of bacteria and viruses that invade the body.  Other\r\nexperts report on advances in understanding other complex\r\nsystems, such as the metabolic system that turns our food intake\r\ninto energy and growth, or systems of fictitious \"agents\" that\r\nwork in novel computer programs that attempt to reproduce aspects\r\nof creative thought.  The clash of ideas that come from\r\nsimultaneous consideration of these different systems should\r\ngenerate principles of wide applicability.  Such principles are\r\nessential if we are to advance beyond the stage of collecting\r\npieces of data that add to our understanding of elements of\r\nsystem behavior but leave us more and more baffled as to how all\r\nthese elements combine to give effective system performance, and\r\nhow we could ever manipulate system behavior with any confidence.\r\nIn time, identification and validation of these principles can\r\nhave far-reaching applications ranging from aid to physicians in\r\ngenerating manipulations that help the immune system fight\r\ndisease, to enabling computer programmers to find novel ways to\r\nfight \"virus\" and other intrusions into computer systems and to\r\ndesign computer systems that \"think\" less rigidly and more\r\ncreatively than present \"intelligent\" computers.\r\n\r\n",
