 "awd_abstract_narration": "Netshape material forming through plastic deformation is an efficient manufacturing process.  A high plastic strain and a high speed with a low forming energy is desired in netshape forming.  Superplastic forming can achieve extremely high strains, but the strain rate is too low for mass production and thus is not feasible for the automobile industry.  At a high strain rate (-1/s) the formability in hot forming is usually lower than that at room temperature, due to the lack of a hardening mechanism to resist localized necking.  The objective of this project is to develop a new forming technique with improved formability limit, reduced forming energy and cost, and improved mechanical property.  The approach is to use a new concept based on thermomechanically activated transient plasticity to achieve high rates of deformation at low stresses.  In this process the workpiece is deformed under a nonstable  microstructure state at a thermomechanically activated deformation condition.  With a sequential post heat treatment, the mechanical properties of the formed parts can be significantly improved.  The elevated temperature forming limit diagram with the consideration of strain rate and microstructure evolution will be established to serve as a foundation for manufacturing process design.\r\n     This project is expected to generate important knowledge fundamental to thermo-mechanically activated transient plasticity.  This knowledge will be important to the advancement of netshape forming technology, especially on formability improvement for aluminum and high-strength steels, as well as significant implication for manufacturing education.\r\n",
