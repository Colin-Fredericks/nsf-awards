 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Doctoral Dissertation research evaluates the occurrence and timing of third party interventions in intrastate disputes.  Specifically, what factors influence whether or not a third party will intervene in an intrastate dispute?  What factors influence when a third party will intervene in an intrastate dispute?  Third party interventions and intrastate disputes are defined in this study so as to incorporate a wide range of intervention and dispute types.  As a result, this study is original in that it broadly analyzes the phenomena of third party interventions in intrastate disputes, as opposed to analyzing just one type of intervention (i.e. military intervention) or one typo of intrastate dispute (i.e. ethnic disputes)>  Several hypotheses are derived from major theoretical perspectives in the filed on international relations in order to explain the occurrence and timing of third party interventions.  The hypotheses are tested against the historical record of third party interventions in intrastate disputes in the post World War II period.  The primary objective of this project is to evaluate a set of hypotheses relating various factors to the occurrence and timing of third party interventions.  In doing so, this study provides a better understanding of why, when, and how third parties intervene in disputes that occur between domestic groups within the borders of a state.  A secondary objective of this project is the collection and dissemination of a new source of data pertaining to third party interventions in intrastate disputes in the post-World War II period.  There are no existing sets of data containing a broad range of third party interventions in intrastate disputes for this period.",
