 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program supports research on mechanisms of organometallic reactions by Dr. Charles P. Casey of the Chemistry Department, University of Wisconsin at Madison.  Three distinct areas of research will be pursued: investigations of d-0 yttrium and zirconium olefin complexes; development of pi-propargyl metal complexes; and the chemistry of rhenium carbene complexes. The systems chosen for the first area of investigation will permit measurement of the rate of inversion at the metal center and the rate constants for the addition of a metal alkyl group to complexed alkenes.  This information is important for understanding the fundamental steps in olefin polymerization and the stereochemistry of polymerization with chiral metallocene catalysts.  In the second topic, reactions of nucleophiles with pi-propargyl complexes will be investigated in order to uncover a basic understanding of the processes that generate these species. These investigations are targeted toward an understanding of such synthetically important reactions as the double nucleophilic additions to propargyl carbonates.  Finally, the stereochemistry of addition of phosphines with rhenium carbene complexes will be studied, along with the formation of some unusual complexes designed to give information about modes of association of metals with double-bonded carbon compounds and about using variation in ring strain to favor formation of desired products.  \r\n\r\nOrganometallic chemistry has proved to be very useful in homogeneous catalysis and in developing new methods and reagents for synthesis of organic compounds. The reactions chosen for investigation are relevant to the behavior of commercially important processes.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
