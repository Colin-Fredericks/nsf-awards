A key unresolved issue\r\nin Rho-family signaling is how the GTPases are activated by upstream\r\nguanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in the Dbl-family.  This\r\nproposal describes structural and functional analysis of a recently\r\ndiscovered Dbl-family GEF, human PIXB (hPIXB).  Initial stages of the work\r\nwill focus on structure determination of the Dbl-homology (DH) domain of\r\nhPIXB by NMR spectroscopy.  The large size and poor aliphatic chemical\r\nshift dispersion of the domain will necessitate use of selective methyl\r\ngroup and aromatic labeling strategies to obtain sidechain chemical shift\r\nassignments and a global fold of the domain.  The work will represent the\r\nfirst application of these strategies to a protein of unknown fold, and as\r\nsuch will provide a critical test of their utility in structure\r\ndetermination of larger proteins by NMR.  The structure will facilitate\r\namino acid sequence analyses across the Dbl family, providing important\r\nclues regarding mechanisms of catalysis and GTPase recognition by DH\r\ndomains.  The structure, along with NMR mapping of the GTPase interface,\r\nwill then guide mutagenesis experiments to identify the roles of specific\r\namino acids in mediating GEF catalysis.  Comparisons with structural and\r\nfunctional data on other GEF domains will then reveal general principles of\r\nnucleotide exchange catalysis.  Finally, the role of the plekstrin homology\r\n(PH) domain, found immediately C-terminal to all DH domains, in regulating\r\nGTPase binding and GEF activity will be examined biochemically and\r\nspectroscopically.  The results will explain whether the hPIXB PH domain\r\nfunctions simply as a membrane-targeting sequence or as an allosteric\r\nregulator of DH domain GEF activity.  This information will have\r\nimplications regarding the regulation of DH proteins and mechanisms of\r\nGTPase activation in the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Non-technical\r\n\r\nThe Rho GTPases represent an important class of proteins that\r\ntransmit signals controlling cell shape, adhesion and movement.  These\r\nmolecules cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound\r\nstate.  When complexed with GTP, but not GDP, they have strong affinity for\r\nselected target proteins, and binding to these molecules constitutes\r\ntransmission of information within the cell.  Guanine nucleotide exchange\r\nfactors (GEFs) in the Dbl family are enzymes that catalyze release of GDP\r\nand rebinding of GTP, thus serving to increase the cellular population of\r\nactivated Rho proteins.  This study focuses on understanding the molecular\r\nmechanisms of Dbl protein activity toward the Rho GTPases. Initial work\r\ndeals with determination of the three-dimensional structure of one Dbl\r\nfamily member, hPIXB, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).\r\nIn addition to providing important functional information, these studies\r\nwill also provide a platform for development of new strategies for\r\nstructure determination by NMR.  This work will be followed by biochemical\r\nstudies of hPIXB mutants that will enable identification of individual\r\namino acids in the protein that are important for activity.  Finally, there\r\nis evidence that the activities of the Dbl proteins may be regulated in an\r\nintramolecular fashion through interactions of the catalytic domain with an\r\nadjacent regulatory module. Spectroscopic and biochemical assays will be\r\nsued to probe the nature and function of this interaction.  Together, these\r\nstudies will explain many of the biochemical and structural mechanisms used\r\nto regulate the level of activated Rho family GTPases in the cell.\r\n",
